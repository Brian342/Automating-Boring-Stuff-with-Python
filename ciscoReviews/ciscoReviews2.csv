"Manager, network services",4.0,"Mar 13, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Systems engineer,3.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years","Overall, Cisco is a good place to work. As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.","If you end up with a manager who manipulates systems and relationships—undermining direct reports, peers, and even superiors to secure promotion or survival—the only real option is to leave. Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.

Cisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of ground-level realities."

Overall a supportive company culture","The 'old guard' of Cisco can be quite bureaucratic and political. You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.

After a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.

Product sales specialist,2.0,"May 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years",None. Hope it could be better.,"The decision-making style within this historic IT company often reminds me of the unpredictability seen in broad policy shifts like the Trump-era tariffs — top-down directives issued without adequate consideration for on-the-ground realities. In some cases, organizational restructures have been implemented without fully understanding product segmentation, technical distinctions, or how various solutions align with customer needs. This has led to inefficiencies and friction among teams.

There’s also a noticeable tendency toward rigid, hierarchical leadership — occasionally influenced by a militaristic mindset — which can stifle open communication and discourage constructive feedback. When leadership becomes overly dominant or insulated, particularly at the regional level, it hampers effective decision-making and fosters an unhealthy work environment.

Moreover, the company’s global alignment remains inconsistent. Reporting lines still vary by country, and unequal treatment of product-side teams by account-side stakeholders reflects broader issues in organizational equity. These structural imbalances need to be addressed to create a truly collaborative and fair working culture."

Engineering leader,5.0,"May 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","I honestly can't speak highly enough about my experience at Cisco. From day one, it's been clear that this is a company that genuinely prioritizes its employees.

The Work-Life Balance (WLB) is truly outstanding – it's not just a buzzword here, it's deeply ingrained in the culture. Leadership actively encourages you to disconnect, take time off, and manage your schedule flexibly. Whether it's managing family commitments, personal appointments, or just needing time to recharge, Cisco provides the flexibility and support to ensure work seamlessly integrates into your life, rather than dominating it. Burnout is not a factor here; instead, there's a strong emphasis on sustainable productivity and employee well-being.

Compensation and Benefits are also exceptionally good. The pay is highly competitive, reflecting the value employees bring. Beyond a great base salary, the comprehensive benefits package (health, 401k match, generous PTO, and potential for bonuses/RSUs) is fantastic. I feel truly valued and fairly compensated for my contributions.

Beyond these two major points, the culture is incredibly collaborative and supportive. You're surrounded by brilliant, kind, and approachable colleagues. There are ample opportunities for learning and growth, whether through internal programs, mentorship, or working on cutting-edge projects. Cisco's commitment to innovation and social impact (diversity, sustainability) also makes it a truly rewarding place to work. It's a company where you can feel proud of what you're contributing to.""","Honestly, it's genuinely challenging to pinpoint any significant 'cons' that detract from the overwhelmingly positive experience at Cisco. My experience here has consistently exceeded expectations. If I had to stretch to identify a 'con,' perhaps the sheer size of the organization means navigating certain internal processes can sometimes take a moment, but teams are always helpful and resources are abundant. This is a truly minor point within a sea of positives."

You will get a free subscription to Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learn and more.","Most people are average and not ambitious.
An old, large, and cumbersome product (ISE).
Lots of spaghetti code.
Very little development. Most of the work involves maintaining tests and fixing bugs (the product is poorly written).
No one knows the system well enough in depth, and when changes are made to one flow, it's not always possible to predict how other flows will be affected.
The managers are focused on trivial matters rather than the main issues. For example, they concentrate on test code coverage instead of its quality. As a result, many tests cover the code without actually checking anything.
Old architecture. No micro-services and no cloud."

The people in Cisco are mostly exceptional to work with and a highlight of working there.","Some roles became overwhelming as each year you were expected to do more with less resources.  Key sales resources would be taken away or there'd be hiring freezes and you'd have to pick up the slack and were expected to overachieve on your sales goal.  Cisco could do a better job making information about employee development programs known as they have various programs, but sometimes you just find out randomly through word of mouth. Even if someone needs to be nominated for a program, the employees should know they exist."
