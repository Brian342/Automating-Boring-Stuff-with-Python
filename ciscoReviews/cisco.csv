Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 26, 2018","Former employee, less than 1 year","-you can get onboard VERY quickly and all your devices and trainings can be ready in 1 week.
-you can give feedback easily to your manager 
-The pay is good","1-Extremely stressful env EVERYthing revolves around quota and sales even if you are not in sales teams.  but if you are not getting your Quota while you are not sales function it will impact your performance and your bonus. 

2-In my interview i was asked if i ever worked with quota and I said no but when i started my job I found out that they added quota on me and its noncommissionble and must bring it each quarter. i disagreed and then I said if I work on quota then I need my commission.. Managers did not agree and I had a conflict with them.

3- The company has VERY high turnover from employees and contractors. its not easy to deal with too many changes per day and week and month.

4- They keep acquiring companies and its tough to focus on your role since every other quarter there is a new re-org and new policies. 

5-The work pace is TOOOO FAST and the company has TOOOO MANY  customer accounts and they expect you to over perform and do your 150%. All the team members and your other colleagues are  not easy to meet and talk with them. Every thing is Webex and ALl the workers are overloaded with work.

6- Its nice to have many Tools to help you do your work like webex  etc BUT  its overused with all the teams. for example if you ask any question about anything they team member will answer you with list of ALL the webex recordings and links by the time you want to watch them and understand the answer that is like a week worth of things and the team member thinks he did the write think for you but really he gave you Major new work. 

7- Too many trainings, by the team you do your internal meeting (physical or webes), then you calls, then your huge list of links and webex recordings its really tough to achieve during your day since all these things take your time and you may have time later on the day to do some of your work.

8- There are SO many feedbacks on you during the week and after each sessions etc etc you need to be always connected with the team and it feels that you ONLY live for Cisco there is nothing else to do in this life. 

9-I have never seen a company that asks their sales team commitment calls to be WEEKLY. So the sales team are  in MAJOR stress and they stress the other teams with them. 

10- Unless you like that type of  env and CONTINUES work , then I don't recommend that company for people with Family and kids and social life.  I noticed most  people working very long hours from 8am until OPEN. 

11- Cisco has many products (old, new, acquired, etc) and once you join,   they will buy new company and then new products. Most of these products work in theory but in real life and at customer site its REALLY complicated and tough and they may work but with a lot of difficulties and many Cisco internal teams involvements. its Tough technical env.  with all these complications. 

12-  Cisco  were a hardware company and trying to switch to software company and that is difficult and too many challenges especially they don't have the software company mindset."

Manager,2.0,"Jul 31, 2019",Former employee,"Great pay and benefits for employees and I was happy to do the work while I was there. Always felt like I agreed with most upper management and the business direction.

Flexible work schedule and very accommodating to people with families.","Although working from home was a nice benefit, none of the great benefits you'd like to find at a Silicon Valley company like free food and other services. Definitely old school in how they run their business - which isn't a great thing for a tech co.

Layoffs are pretty consistent, with a big one in the summer/fall and usually after each quarter, although at varying sizes. They always try to make it sound like it's for business reasons, but it's still surprising as Cisco seem to meeting their goals for the last few years. They typically do it so they can get rid of higher grade folks, hire lower grade folks or contractors and bank the savings. Even with nice severance packages, they net out in the positive.

Middle management is horrific. After good management left, my team was left in shambles and leadership slowly drove team away one by one and then blamed everyone else. Lots of politics. Many managers will devise ways to get rid of those who don't agree with their opinions by withholding bonuses, prevent any movement to other teams, uncomfortable 1-1 conversations, etc.

Also the division between FTEs and contractors is very apparent and the pay disparity is embarrassing as are the benefits (read none).  This is problematic across the company as I'd guess 50% of their workforce is contractors (although they never release those numbers)."
