"Manager, network services",4.0,"Mar 13, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Systems engineer,3.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years","Overall, Cisco is a good place to work. As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.","If you end up with a manager who manipulates systems and relationships—undermining direct reports, peers, and even superiors to secure promotion or survival—the only real option is to leave. Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.

Cisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of ground-level realities."
Strategy & planning,4.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Former employee,"Grow and learn with some genuinely smart and capable folks
Prestige of working for the market leader
Stays innovative through some great external acquisitions
Good internal tools and work resources
Overall a supportive company culture","The 'old guard' of Cisco can be quite bureaucratic and political. You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.

After a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.

It's a big company (~80K employees). Things can get lost."
Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco offers a truly flexible hybrid work environment, which makes it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The team I work with is incredibly supportive, collaborative, and open to new ideas. The culture promotes learning, growth, and inclusion. Leadership is approachable and transparent. Overall, it's a positive and empowering place to work.",None so far – I've had a great experience.

Softwater engineer,4.0,"Aug 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","Good salary, most vacation days I've seen in the market, good people and no toxic work environment","Very demanding, management decisions are not always logical from developer point of view (taking on a lot of work while deveopment team is understaffed)"
Program manager,1.0,"May 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","As a Programme Manager at Cisco, my role involved school visits and leading the LittleBigAwards campaign.","I made the difficult decision to leave Cisco because I wanted to work in an environment where accessibility, inclusion, and opportunities for growth were prioritised. While I appreciated many aspects of the company, the lack of true disability inclusion and the ongoing uncertainty from constant reorganisations pushed me to seek a more supportive and empowering workplace."
Data scientist,2.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Chill work life balance and long paternity leave if you need it.,"I felt it was a cost cutting place. 
Did not even have company sponsored team dinners and no one knows which direction to work on. Sort of like a ruder less ship.
It did not feel like a top IT place. It had a lot of very average people most of whom had only masters from only a few select colleges i.e. the ones that the seniors belonged to. Low level of tech expertise is needed and most higher level people didn't understand much advanced ML stuff. Much higher importance was given to visibility than actual innovation and being managers pet will take you a long way."
Solution architect,4.0,"Aug 7, 2025",Former employee,"Positive work environment with strong benefits and a focus on employee well-being.

There are too many dead weights that hides behind bureaucracy and continues to move up. Once you reach a director level, you can hide and get rewarded for doing the minimum. While those that really take care of the customers are just swept under the rug. Too many silots, favortisms, and class based culture (don't want to mention name of those from that country wink wink). Last and foremost, not good spending all that money on Splunk acquisition.

Absolutely fabulous work culture and they make sure the folks they hire fit into it. 
Great benefits. 
Good learning curve, albeit a bit slow. If you are looking for excitement, not the place for you- if you are looking for satisfaction, then it is.
Great work life balance and inclusive culture ( I say this as a woman)","For anyone actually reading: Not many cons to Cisco, just that leadership/ management is still a bit old school and ageist in my BU (AppD Observability) . Good people, but you better be 35+ to be taken seriously in a leadership role, even if your talent is recognised in other ways before that.

CISCO India Less 0.5% have any meaning ful growth.  These are the chosen onces by VP/ Director , who are given RSUs more oftern. RSUs distribution is always done in close doors and its opaque. you will not even know if a quarter has budget for that . Very few coming from external hired make a mark.

Worst thing is you will end up reporting to your buddy / colleague - or may be junior who chose to be people manager , than being in technical ( not even having management degrees) . No matter , the person could be technical background,  be even 50% of your capapbilities. But he is well oiled in the system .
