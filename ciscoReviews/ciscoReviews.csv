"Manager, network services",4.0,"Mar 13, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Systems engineer,3.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years","Overall, Cisco is a good place to work. As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.","If you end up with a manager who manipulates systems and relationships—undermining direct reports, peers, and even superiors to secure promotion or survival—the only real option is to leave. Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.

Cisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of ground-level realities."
Strategy & planning,4.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Former employee,"Grow and learn with some genuinely smart and capable folks
Prestige of working for the market leader
Stays innovative through some great external acquisitions
Good internal tools and work resources
Overall a supportive company culture","The 'old guard' of Cisco can be quite bureaucratic and political. You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.

After a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.

It's a big company (~80K employees). Things can get lost."
Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco offers a truly flexible hybrid work environment, which makes it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The team I work with is incredibly supportive, collaborative, and open to new ideas. The culture promotes learning, growth, and inclusion. Leadership is approachable and transparent. Overall, it's a positive and empowering place to work.",None so far – I've had a great experience.

Program manager,1.0,"May 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","As a Programme Manager at Cisco, my role involved school visits and leading the LittleBigAwards campaign.","I made the difficult decision to leave Cisco because I wanted to work in an environment where accessibility, inclusion, and opportunities for growth were prioritised. While I appreciated many aspects of the company, the lack of true disability inclusion and the ongoing uncertainty from constant reorganisations pushed me to seek a more supportive and empowering workplace."
Data scientist,2.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Chill work life balance and long paternity leave if you need it.,"I felt it was a cost cutting place. 
Did not even have company sponsored team dinners and no one knows which direction to work on. Sort of like a ruder less ship.
It did not feel like a top IT place. It had a lot of very average people most of whom had only masters from only a few select colleges i.e. the ones that the seniors belonged to. Low level of tech expertise is needed and most higher level people didn't understand much advanced ML stuff. Much higher importance was given to visibility than actual innovation and being managers pet will take you a long way."

Worst thing is you will end up reporting to your buddy / colleague - or may be junior who chose to be people manager , than being in technical ( not even having management degrees) .

Hope it could be better.,"The decision-making style within this historic IT company often reminds me of the unpredictability seen in broad policy shifts like the Trump-era tariffs — top-down directives issued without adequate consideration for on-the-ground realities. In some cases, organizational restructures have been implemented without fully understanding product segmentation, technical distinctions, or how various solutions align with customer needs. This has led to inefficiencies and friction among teams.

There’s also a noticeable tendency toward rigid, hierarchical leadership — occasionally influenced by a militaristic mindset — which can stifle open communication and discourage constructive feedback. When leadership becomes overly dominant or insulated, particularly at the regional level, it hampers effective decision-making and fosters an unhealthy work environment.

Moreover, the company’s global alignment remains inconsistent. Reporting lines still vary by country, and unequal treatment of product-side teams by account-side stakeholders reflects broader issues in organizational equity. These structural imbalances need to be addressed to create a truly collaborative and fair working culture."

Engineering leader,5.0,"May 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","I honestly can't speak highly enough about my experience at Cisco. From day one, it's been clear that this is a company that genuinely prioritizes its employees.

The Work-Life Balance (WLB) is truly outstanding – it's not just a buzzword here, it's deeply ingrained in the culture. Leadership actively encourages you to disconnect, take time off, and manage your schedule flexibly. Whether it's managing family commitments, personal appointments, or just needing time to recharge, Cisco provides the flexibility and support to ensure work seamlessly integrates into your life, rather than dominating it. Burnout is not a factor here; instead, there's a strong emphasis on sustainable productivity and employee well-being.

Compensation and Benefits are also exceptionally good. The pay is highly competitive, reflecting the value employees bring. Beyond a great base salary, the comprehensive benefits package (health, 401k match, generous PTO, and potential for bonuses/RSUs) is fantastic. I feel truly valued and fairly compensated for my contributions.

Beyond these two major points, the culture is incredibly collaborative and supportive. You're surrounded by brilliant, kind, and approachable colleagues. There are ample opportunities for learning and growth, whether through internal programs, mentorship, or working on cutting-edge projects. Cisco's commitment to innovation and social impact (diversity, sustainability) also makes it a truly rewarding place to work. It's a company where you can feel proud of what you're contributing to.""","Honestly, it's genuinely challenging to pinpoint any significant 'cons' that detract from the overwhelmingly positive experience at Cisco. My experience here has consistently exceeded expectations. If I had to stretch to identify a 'con,' perhaps the sheer size of the organization means navigating certain internal processes can sometimes take a moment, but teams are always helpful and resources are abundant. This is a truly minor point within a sea of positives."

- Exposure to a wide range of IT and cybersecurity products. Free certifications & courses that are recognised worldwide.
- You’ll learn a lot—mostly because you’re forced to wear multiple hats.
- Lots of GREAT colleagues who try to support each other under pressure. They're some of the nicest workmates you'll ever end up working with.","- After the mass layoff, workloads doubled, but salaries stayed the same. Management’s answer: ""budget constraints."" Nothing changes - well, not in your favour anyways. But policy and workload changes? A lot.
- You're expected to do more than what you were officially hired for - lead generation, qualification, technical guidance, account creation, and pseudo-account management—but you're still treated and paid like a basic lead qualifier. Commissions are even capped. Imagine closing a deal more than 600k in a single week, but your commission didn't even reflect 1% of that achievement. Instead, rewards are given in the form of cash vouchers or gift cards.
- That being said; no career growth & no clear progression from management. Lots of GREAT people have left just because you're so busy focusing on the wrong things. You're punishing TOP achievers just because they don't follow your note-keeping style?? ridiculous.
- Recognition is scarce. You keep the engine running, but it feels like you’re invisible unless something goes wrong. Each quarterly meeting is spent on celebrating wins that didn't even reflect back to the team members' contribution.
- ""Work-life balance"" is for other teams & upper management. For the rest of us, it's 5 days in the office & you can only make calls at your own desk, not in any of the designated quiet room. Reason being: they want to SEE & HEAR you make the calls. As if we don't use recording tools. Micromanagement at its peak.
- Leadership is disconnected from day-to-day struggles. Feedback feels like it goes into a black hole. Pointless. Weekly check ins? Useless."

Super learning opportunities and great technologies","CCBU is generally a great place to work, but unfortunately, a few handful unfit so called managers have severely impacted the environment. In some teams, the toxicity is particularly rampant, and it goes unchecked because two individuals are enabling unethical behavior , and its unchecked totally, as developers fear their job , as they will threathen them with dire consequences.

Person KK, who is abusive and egotistical, constantly demands respect, claiming to be the key to the team’s success while threatening others with consequences, if he is not respected. Person NS, a close friend of K's wife, that everyone must support him, and blindly will follow him, technically NS himself will not know anything.

In this dysfunctional environment, any task that doesn't get done is automatically attributed by a threat to talk to KK. The team works tirelessly, yet NS takes all the credit, while KK rewards him for it and never the team. If you don’t meet expectations, NS will relentlessly contact you—calling, texting, and reach out non stop on whats-app and even reaching out to your family, all while disregarding any personal boundaries. 

N's only role seems to be demanding ETAs with no planning or structure, undermining Cisco’s otherwise amazing culture.

This stressful environemnt persists only because both K and N protect each other’s interests. I was ill and I could not even get up, my father was contacted on phone as to where is your son and while I was sick with a high fever. The mental stress I endured is ongoing as only one person listens who is in USA, and he is unaware of these folks. As a developer I am not able to work on new technologies and upcomign features and techstack.
Thats how talent dies.
My peers in Vendor company were tortured mentally even in pregnancy.

Cisco is a wonderful company, but this one team under Kk and N’s so called titled leadership is a glaring exception."

"Leaders in finance and technology (lift), financial analyst",2.0,"Nov 15, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","I completed Cisco's LIFT Program and was initially excited by its strong reputation in the Cisco community. The program was once an esteemed and highly respected path for early-career development, but unfortunately, things have gone downhill under the current management.","Leadership has been particularly problematic. He is difficult to work with, and I personally observed a sexist bias within the program. It was clear that male participants were promoted more frequently than women, which was a shared concern among my graduating class.

The program consists of four rotations and four LIFT academies. While these academies are meant to support development, in practice, they lack fairness. Assessments are inconsistent, and favoritism is common. Performance doesn’t always seem to matter. For instance, the “top performer” in my group was actually absent on vacation for a large part of the timeline, and despite multiple complaints about their performance, program management ignored these concerns and selected that person as the only one from our group to receive LIFT honors.

The current class is regarded as having a poor attitude, often logging in after 11 a.m. and frequently complaining. 

Overall, if you're one of Tim’s favorites, you may have a smoother path, but if not, expect to face politics rather than professional growth. The LIFT Program needs strong, unbiased leadership to restore its reputation and value."

Flexible working arrangements.
Average benefits.","Cisco has become an extremely unstable company. Every year I worked there, there were layoffs, and now layoffs have become a regular occurrence. In my last year alone, there were three rounds of layoffs, which clearly indicates that management lacks direction. Instead of implementing a strong long-term strategy, leadership continuously resorts to downsizing, showing a complete lack of vision for the company's future.

Additionally, many management and director-level roles are assigned to individuals with little to no relevant experience. This leads to poor decision-making and a lack of leadership. Collaboration between teams is nearly nonexistent, with constant conflicts between the so-called global teams and regional teams. The work environment is toxic, and promotions are not based on hard work or expertise but rather on internal connections and favoritism.

Salaries are below industry average, and salary increases are rare. If you're expecting regular raises, good luck—because they barely happen. Any employee benefits or initiatives seem to be purely for show rather than genuine care for employees. One glaring example was when the company was publicly celebrating being voted a ""Best Place to Work"" in the morning, only to start laying off employees that same afternoon. This was handled in an unprofessional and insensitive manner, proving that most of Cisco's employee initiatives are just for appearances.

Internal structures and processes are outdated and dysfunctional, yet no one takes meaningful action to fix them. Instead of addressing inefficiencies, the company always chooses the easy way out—layoffs. They don't even attempt to reallocate employees to other internal positions when teams are restructured. Instead, they lay off existing employees and hire new ones for similar roles.

If you don’t mind constant instability, poor leadership, and a company that prioritizes image over employee well-being, then Cisco might be the place for you. But if you’re looking for long-term stability and career growth, I’d advise looking elsewhere."

- Lots of meetings, but that's just remote tech life
- An already silo'd company feels extra silo'd when we are basically all remote
- Projects might not truly see the light of day, but that's the cold corporate world for you
- Can be hard to get converted from a contractor to a full-time employee

Big stuff:
- Executive leadership is ignorant of how people lower down the totem pole work. Or worse yet, they just don't care. Recent layoffs that hit the part of the company that had been meeting projections are laughable. All in the name of ""optimizing for growth around AI""
- Layoffs are happening twice a year at this point. TWICE. And they aren't small either. The ""always be hiring, always be firing"" method feels terrifying to work under.

The teams are usually driven by certain groups of people who have the invisible ""authority"" and ""power"". The work is busy, but it's because of the disorganized and non-feedback work.

Some senior management is trying to change the company culture and fight back in the market by pushing Meraki to the front of the product line, but Meraki by itself is not an answer. The problems are deep and structural and they require knowledgeable, fearless leaders to make any progress. Unfortunately for Cisco, those are few and far between.

Anonymous employee,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years",Used to be great place,"Internal to Cisco. Huge organisational restructuring every couple of years with redundancies. Has lost the way that made it great. 

Chaos has ensued during each restructuring. Several board level leaders have left. Last minute decisions and chop changing by ELT because of poor decisions and inability to keep to long term plans.

The phrase care deeply is coined by ELT. Almost verging on a brain washing and gas lighting process because the actions do not match:

Announcing redundancies, then waiting 4 weeks before starting. leaving employee in the dark and creating huge amounts of stress.

Middle managers and employees are being squeezed, creating a toxic workplace. Employees forced into the list below. Fearful of saying anything, due to the every 2 year redundancies:

	• Accept targets that are over 4 months late and repay commissions retroactively.
	•	Cover increased number of product lines, despite inadequate training on the new offerings.
	•	Meet significantly increased targets, sometimes 6x or more.
	•	Take on multiple roles due to ongoing layoffs over the past year.

• No voluntary redundancy so accept all the above or leave of your own accord. 
• No training program to re-skill talent into new growth areas. Would rather fire and hire.

No pay increase to reflect these additional responsibilities."

Job security has been a big issue since 2022.

Many employees appreciate Cisco’s focus on work-life balance, flexible work arrangements, and inclusive culture, which can make it an appealing workplace for those seeking stability and growth in the tech industry.","As a large, global corporation, Cisco’s size can sometimes mean that navigating internal processes and decision-making can be slow, with layers of bureaucracy that may delay project approvals or adaptability to change. This structure may feel limiting for employees who prefer a more agile, startup-like environment. Additionally, some teams can experience a high level of demand and fast-paced work, which may occasionally impact work-life balance depending on the project and department."

* The leadership team is too politically correct - always trying to say the 'right thing' so as not to upset anyone. Sadly. this has the opposite effect than is intended. There are multiple groups within the company actively hostile towards others.
* The long term strategies never seem to work, since every 1-2 years there is 'another restructuring' and the share price simply stagnates
* Many products & processes are still hardware focused - don't come here looking for a fast-pased innovative environment (it might exist in small parts of Cisco, but it's not the overall culture)"

Great salary and benefits, I have an amazing team, and I personally see my impact across the company. These are all great qualities and why I would never want to leave. I could retire here…. But see cons.","It is a layoff culture. “Cognitive dissonance” are the two words employees should note as leadership fails to respect us in words what their behavior is communicating (see cisco’s response on 12/9, “committed to retaining talent” (paraphrased). It’s simply not true by their actions.

I think in the past four years I have experienced six layoffs and so far survived them all. The reality though is that we always know these layoffs are around the corner, and when the news is leaked (which it always is) people freak out (understandably!). Our last layoff required three+ months of not knowing who would have a job—that’s not going to help our bottom line (but I think is tied to a regulation). 

Though, root cause is not the timeline. It’s the layoff and (I think unintentional) dishonesty that kills me and has me in a bind—I love this company, but my stress can’t handle this company. I have a family to feed. 

Also, leadership is a bit out of touch. In the last layoff they remarked the percentage cut they would receive in bonus, which still resulted in multi million salaries (which was commented on in the chat as it happened, with the receipts… ouch!). That’s not consolation for the person who relies on their check to stay housed and feed their family, especially in this oversaturated market."

Flexible Working Hours:
The company offers flexible working hours, which has been a significant benefit. Employees are allowed to start and finish their workdays at times that suit their personal schedules, as long as they meet project deadlines and attend necessary meetings.

Remote Work Options:
Since the pandemic, Cisco has adopted a hybrid work model. Employees have the option to work from home several days a week, which greatly reduces commuting time and allows for a more comfortable and productive work environment.

Vacation and Time Off:
The company provides generous vacation days and encourages employees to use them. I never felt pressured to skip my vacations, and management genuinely supports taking time off to recharge.

Health and Wellness Programs:
Cisco offers various health and wellness programs, including gym memberships, yoga classes, and mental health resources. These programs are a testament to the company's commitment to the well-being of its employees.

Cisco Certifications and Training Materials are free!! Of course it is Cisco.","It will take a long time to become a ""blue-badge"" which means Cisco-direct-hire employee."

Account manager,3.0,"Feb 8, 2024","Current employee, more than 5 years","The benefits of working at Cisco are what keeps people in seat. Great healthcare, great stock options, great wfh atmosphere. The many different products that Cisco makes allows for account managers to hit their goal from one of their many product lines. The products that Cisco makes are phenomenal.","As a sales rep, you really have no control over what territory you cover, and what accounts you have this year to next. If you are not Enterprise sales rep, you could spend the entire year trying to develop a relationship with an account, only to find out that you no longer cover it when the new fiscal comes around. The goals drastically change, with no warrant to why or how they came up with this number. Finance also will regoal you and keep all your money. Mid-level management also has little to no control or say into how things are managed or done. Cisco sells against itself. Some products compete with each other, as well as some of the programs like NFR give products away."

That person takes the baton to talk about whatever jargon the company is into at the moment without making any differences.

- Clunky internal tools such as Webex, HiringSpace.

And don't expect promotion to be even close to the meaning of 'significant'.

Cisco provides a lot of resources and opportunities to explore what you uniquely bring to your work, lead with your strengths, practice mindfulness, and keep balance and flexibility in your life. It is a place that strives to be welcoming and supportive of diverse communities with a lot of employee resource groups to help. Their benefits are great and receiving 80 hrs per year to volunteer is simply amazing. I hope they don't cut that back.","The PTO is 20 days per year, but you are forced to use 3-4 for those days during the mandatory holiday shutdown period, so the PTO is effectively 16 or 17 days. 
They have had a lot of unannounced layoffs or ""restructuring"" since I joined.
And like any large corporation, a lot of the internal processes and requirements are like navigating a maze to follow. 
It is also very slow to move and coming from an acquisition this was a hard transition. Also, when we were acquired, we thought we would get more resources to help, but that was not the case. 
Despite the ideals for how to be a good leader and make Cisco a great place to work, individual managers may or may not follow, leaving much variability in the working environment on a particular team."

Then you are placed into a team within the 5 specialized areas in TAC: Service Provider, Enterprise, Security, Datacenter, and Collaboration.

I don’t expect my super-manager (who is not even 1% technical) to poke his nose in technical stuff - literally writing emails to customers :p
With no knowledge of what a technical issue looks like, some of these id**ts used to flood emails mentioning “ensure to solve issues & if you have solved atleast one issue for the day only then logout, make this a thumb rule”. This statement was enough for me to resign

Its a good company as all reviews might not be bought. But you need to be in the right team under the right management. In Bangalore its a bunch of people with no family life, no interests, no personal life who are managers and expecting bullsh*t from the teams.

Senior business analyst,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Employee culture at the individual contributor level is fantastic.

Work/Life Balance is good.","Back to laying off every 6 months. The most likely reason you will get laid off is ""this year's executive"" for your function wants to do things differently. Or your team is marooned in the wrong organization. How did your team get marooned? From last year's executive's re-org. Being re-orged into IT or Operations is a common death sentence and you should begin a 6 month exit plan as soon as it happens.

Leadership couldn't answer a ""How to return to growth?"" question after the most recent layoff. CEO had a ""hope in 6 months"" answer. Services EVP had a word salad. This was a seeded question in a moderated forum. Newly appointed Chief Product Officer is coming from a lackluster division (WebEx) and admitted to knowing nothing about Enterprise Networking.

Saw numerous people let go/laid off who were excellent employees who had dedicated themselves to Cisco and were well-liked and respected by peers and/or direct reports. This had a very negative effect on employee morale and created a toxic employee culture.

Seems like everyone thinks their product or solution is the next big thing -- too much drinking the Kool-Aid and not a grasp on the reality facing them in the marketplace

There's a reason people come to Cisco and never leave, it's a company built by good people.","Do-nothing middle management, obsession with forecasting to the detriment of customer engagement, age bias toward Gen X and above for leadership which is stifling innovation and change. 

Recent influence from Palo Alto Networks refugees and Cisco outsiders are destroying what made Cisco different from peers in the industry - good culture. Three days a week centered on obsessively detailed metrics, overly rigid sales processes that destroy authenticity and creativity, fear-based sales culture around performance. There's also an unspoken but obvious effort to undermine longer term Cisco sellers with mercenary hires from outside the company that have no IT background whatsoever. New external leadership hires are telling partners that ""Cisco salespeople are lazy"". 

New sales leader is toxic and clueless about technology, reads from a script, does not understand what customers expect from a mature technology company like Cisco, and is inundating our sales force with administrative overhead that makes AMs/PSSs feel more like accountants. This is couched in a new mantra around ""creating a unified sales process"", but is bogging down sellers with hours upon hours of onerous training and administrative work."

Software engineer,4.0,"May 11, 2023","Former employee, less than 1 year","Everyone I interacted with was friendly, helpful, and professional. Although management pushed for hybrid working from what was previously full remote, it was a 'come at your own time' culture so long as you met your responsibilities. Break room had a fancy coffee machine, and management would cater lunches once a week. Most days I would come into the office to do any work that needed hands on configuration of our testbed in the lab, grab lunch, then continue to work from home.","Well I was laid off after 6 months so obviously layoffs. The late night or early morning meetings to catch up with the India team was tiresome. An incredible breadth of information you have to have a working knowledge of. Every protocol, the custom OS's and commands on the devices, and how to work with Cisco proprietary systems like SD-WAN. You have to learn the CLI commands before you can move onto GUI since you can't accomplish many things with a GUI alone. Personally, my manager was outright adversarial with me as a junior. I was put under the wing of 3 different people in trying to acclimate to the job, it was highly stressful trying to get up to speed. Few transferable skills: I worked with an python library that was eventually made open source, but there wasn't too much documentation and few employers care about my experience with a library that's solely used to test networks."

Cisco's commitment to corporate responsibility and employee well-being further enhance its appeal.","While working at Cisco has its advantages, there are some potential cons to consider: 1. Large Organization: Cisco is a large corporation, which may lead to bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes. 2. Competitive Environment: The tech industry is highly competitive, which can result in pressure to meet performance targets. 3. Job Stability: Like many tech companies, Cisco's workforce may face job instability due to market fluctuations. 4. Workload: Some employees may experience high workloads and long hours, impacting work-life balance. 5. Location: Job locations can vary, and some positions may require relocation. 6. Changing Technologies: The fast-paced tech industry may demand constant adaptation to new technologies and skills. 7.

It used to be the culture.... hopefully it can be recessitated.","Culture is decaying with growing pockets of toxic teams. Leadership that is being promoted have either made a pledge of loyalty to the leadership above or they are a ""yes Sir"" kind of person. So, it has become a norm to see toxic VPs that did not make it to their positions based on merit and see them openly exhibit some of the most outrageously toxic behaviors (condescending, see differing opinions as ""falling out of line"", etc.). This leads to most of the Director level being disempowered and having to balance self preservation with doing the right thing for the business & the employees. The remaining layers of management are each less empowered than the layer above them. This leads to individual contributors that are struggling to contribute because navigating the trickling down toxicity is consuming most of their time and mental cycles. 
The problem is not limited to VP and below. It start with the glaring void of a Head of Engineering in the C-Suite. Each Business Unit Head reports to the CEO - thus making the CEO the one to lead technology direction, prioritizations and the biggest one: getting the BUs to work together to deliver on a platform strategy. That would be great if Chuck was Elon or Jeff B. - but he is not. So, he has outsourced those decisions to be based on C-Suite consensus - the very reason why the C-Suite has resorted to running like the Senate - alliances, lobbying, trading favors, etc. Oh, and the CFO ... he runs the financials like an accountant - I bet Cisco's books have never looked better :-). But top talent is walking to the competition, moral is at an all time low, and innovation (through acquisition, ""Spin In"" , or internal investments) is at a stand still since Kelly left. But I bet those books look good :-). BTW, Splunk does not qualify as ""innovation infusion"". There are plenty of ""innovation"" activities talked about by BU leader turned Chief Strategy Officer (who still cannot get herself to fully perform the CSO role because she has not let go of her BU leader identity - so, she is the CSO but also leads Applications *shake head*). Activities only - no results - no successful monetization. It does not take much to understand why innovation is dead, the culture has turned highly political and toxic, and now business performance is impacted (it's not just due to macroeconomic). It is sad to see such a great company deteriorate at such a rapid pace. It's making it obvious that the #1 Place to Work ranking is a paid PR service. However, I do have to say that out of the entire C-Suite, Fran is the only executive that is delivering results (you may not like or agree with the results or approach but she is delivering). 
What is the CEO succession plan (as Chuck is in semi-retirement mode and focused on building personal legacy/brand vs running a company)?
What is the board thinking & doing??? Fiduciary duty anyone?"

However, the company needs to reevaluate middle management. Investing in management training is the bare minimum and they're currently are doing that, but the company really needs to do more. For example, promoting individuals based on their leadership qualities and not just their technical knowledge and years of experience. Cultivating a more progressive and open-minded culture could go a long way in improving employee satisfaction and retention.","Disappointed by: dental and vision options, have to pay to use company gym, a lot of teams are starting to require ""return to office"" which is going to hurt the company as they are also trying to downsize their real estate, poor laptop options if you need a non-MacBook. Please take all high ratings and company awards lightly, as Cisco does push it's current employees to skew the results.

They were arrogant, emotionally immature, overly defensive, and surprisingly incompetent / out of touch - maybe byproducts of the coasting culture? I also worked with people who were highly capable and professional, so it might've been just a bad luck. Heavy layers of professional middle managers. Constant restructuring (aka layoff) ordered by the leadership who doesn't understand what's happening in the field and things are generally messy because of that.

The remuneration packages are in accordance to what you will be asked to deliver and are usually above the norm, so you will get compensated for the extra mile. What is appreciated is that there are nearly no real jerks around in Cisco.","Over the last years (2022 and 2023) the company tends to build up too high stress in sales on the numbers. Cisco was always on the numbers, but not too pushy neither. Too much push delegated to the sales/account manager level can reach a tipping point where people lose the motivation.

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Nov 30, 2023","Former employee, more than 3 years","Definitely one of the best companies to work for in terms of work life balance. Atleast it’s true in terms of the team I worked for in Bangalore. 
Was extremely lucky to have had amazing managers.","Work was ok initially as a young engineer I got to learn a lot, but as you grow in your career as an SDE your opportunities to learn kinda reduces as you have a lot of senior folk around and you might not end up getting your due recognition and opportunities.

Promotions are difficult as you grow can be said the same for other companies.

Salary hikes are mediocre reasons being budget constraints but company has the budget to spend billions to buy Splunk

Opportunities to switch to a team in US usually gets shot down by pathetic Executives in the US and India. Even if the other team really likes you and wants you there. Basically favourites of those people might get a chance in the future if an opportunity presents itself.

Overall salary compared to other major companies in the market it’s below the market average. I’ve seen smaller and bigger companies who were willing to offer close to 40LPA for the same role.

Lots of reorgs and uncertainty, priorities keep changing and most recently in our team one person had to do 2-3 people’s work would have been valuable if the work was something cutting edge but it basic UI work and some simple backend services to setup simple API routes to serve content to the UI. Definitely got bored and burnt out quite fast."

Account manager,4.0,"Sep 18, 2023","Former employee, more than 8 years","I spend close to 10 years (2012-2022) across various sales/account management roles in inside sales, PSU, SMB, etc. So I guess my 2 cents would give some value: -Sales and customer focused. -If you enjoy high pressure sales environment, a great place to be. -Org takes care of the employees/ benefits. I mean it. benefits, business travel quality, etc. -Great bonding & relationship with fellow peers. -Sales performers are rewarded and recognized. A very satisfying feeling that money cannot buy. (sales champions, chairmans club ,etc) -Great products, strong channel & partner ecosystem. -Partners, customers respect the brand. Makes the selling fun, challenging and a bit easy. -Account manager have power, authority and accountability. -Entire org will come forward to win a deal for and with you. -Fast, less bureaucratic, focus on execution and speed.","-The experience is not uniform and will vary from team to team, manager to manager. While I was fortunate to have amazing managers, peers, I did see certain segments /managers were toxic, career derailing for a few of my friends. Situation can get political/diplomatic. -unrealistic sales number pressure. -you need a bit of luck -commit pressure is unreal at time. (you will love it or hate it) -not every product sells. For eg servers, webex, security sales is tough. So if you are getting in these product sales role - do your research. -The IT hardware is getting commoditized with transformation of SAAS, cloud. Has lots a bit of its charm in recent years. -Cloud, SAAS, Security is paying better these days. (2023). -Career movement / horizontally/ globally is limited. -work life balance very bad if you are in India. I have spend 70% of my weekends working (no one asks, but expects). Something that flows from top, especially in India. Not sure if that has changed since 2022.
-No career/skip manager discussions for professional growth. 

I left Cisco in 2022 as I didn't see any guidance on career growth, plan. I was getting bored. I went ahead for an interview outside to merely assess my market value and get some insights outside of Cisco world. I was shocked at the industry comp being offered. (mind you, i never asked for a single raise. I just believed in Cisco).  Having said, Cisco has been wonderful in so many ways for me. I'll always be grateful and Cisco will always hold a special place. There is never a dull moment and it will prepare you for your future.  I was lucky to be a Cisco."

Network consulting engineer,2.0,"Sep 13, 2023","Current employee, more than 8 years","I guess you could say 401k match is comparable to other competitors. Health care options - HMO / PPO with excellent benefits (like low co-pay, etc.) ESPP are a good benefit you should take advantage of. Work from home option is a perk. There are a lot of excellent engineers with a breadth of knowledge that you can reach out to for assistance. Most are willing to help and are friendly. People are smart here. For the most part. There are bonuses as well. Paid bi-annually. Amount is based on your grade / company performance / personal performance.","Let's list them: 1- middle managers are more or less cheerleaders. Esp people managers. They are also bogged down in a lot of busy meetings. So, you get ignored, for the most part. Not because of you. They are too busy. In busy meetings. Which are stacked. 2 - career stagnation. you will not move ANYWHERE unless you apply internally, which takes, what? 15 to 25 internal interviews? this is pointless and discouraging. 3 - constant layoffs. not always based on performance. in fact, the reason is never revealed to you. So no one knows why / how they were targeted. And its usually annually. right before X-Mas holidays. NICE. Cisco LOVES RIFs. And the funny thing is, they encourage you to apply internally. As if its that easy. See above. 4 - stock price is stagnant and not going anywhere. And hasn't gone anywhere for a lot of years. Well, maybe it trickled up by a few dollars per share. So those RSU benefits I listed above? You won't get rich, folks. 5 - Pointless numerous meetings with people managers, bi-weekly, 1:1. Expecting us to ""grow, grow, grow."" God forbid you don't look busy on your timesheets for your billing hours. They also expect you to know the management chain. When you are near the bottom. OKAY. Sure, I will memorize the names and roles of those 6 layers up, and talk candidly about their visions and what they are seeking. 6 - Mgmt - If you have a toxic manager, you will have a miserable experience. Because this company is stagnant. So you are stuck on the team unless you apply internally. And of course, pass those 25 interviews. Which can take a year and a half. 7 - Upper Mgmt - Don't ever reach out directly to them unless you want to get burnt. They expect you to reach out to their assistant directly. Assuming they have an assistant. They can't / won't be bothered. 8 - Internal technical training - yes they have it. And its not the best. Try 3rd party vendors which are far superior, like INE. 9 - Salary increase. Doesn't exist. And if it does, its basically nothing. Better to simply quit and come back as a different grade. Also salaries are on lower end of the spectrum in a comparable role at a competitor. Salaries depend quite a bit on your geographic region as well."

Extreme flexibility with location -- my department didn't care if people wanted to relocate (to other countries even!). Decent work/life balance.,"Remote culture means it's hard to build connections. Lack of leadership vision. Every quarter it was all about VP shuffling. Very hard to get promoted, very hard to get salary lift. I was there for 3 years before they offered me equity (a very paltry 5-figure amount to be paid over 4 years). Salary is nowhere near FAANG equivalent. 2x year layoffs. US health insurance was very Cali-focused, so if you're trying to use it or live outside of California, be prepared for $$$ visits and prescriptions. There isn't a lot of prestige to the Cisco name anymore (despite what they tell you internally). Cisco bungled the WebEx opportunity during the pandemic. If you are still early and energetic in your career, get what you can out of the experience in a year or two, and plan to leave. For those of you mid-late career, this could be a good place to 'rest and vest' if you can survive the layoff seasons."

Good processes become bad processes if nobody follows them. 2) Company still has many great people and teams. 3) Good benefits. 4) Overall positive culture. 5) If you want to challenge yourself, you can easily do so. There are tons of hard engineering problems to crack. The company has no problem if you want to have a go at it.","1) Sycophantic leadership chains that often care about titles and personal loyalty more than the merits of ideas or their direct reports. 2) Product management has often minimal knowledge of the industries they operate in, and often high turnover in product management. At the same time product management is given complete decision authority on features. 3) Slightly lower pay than the leading companies in Big Tech. 4) Random waves of layoffs that often impact great people, while the not-so-great people remain. Random waves of layoffs have been happening since 2014. Then they try to rehire. 5) 360 reviews are non-existent. If you have a problem with your manager, there is nobody to talk to on a regular basis. 6) Company is emotional and impulsive when it comes to 'disruptive' technologies. Instead of working internally on trying to develop products and technologies for new markets, the company prefers to acquire start-ups with great pitch books. Only to realize a couple of years later that it was too good to be true. Please perform due diligence.
7) In some JDM activities, brazen dishonesty is tolerated by the company from their counterparty. In other words, when a JDM partner substitutes its A-team for its F-team, Cisco turns a blind eye to it and does not demand accountability. As a result, Cisco ends up doing the work internally while pretending that the JDM did it."

So you are almost always. dealing with a mental 'timer' as they are people waiting for you to provide solutions or answers and most of the times it is not easy. Multiple logs , timestamps, data correlation and since you are not the one who has written the code. Except few rare days mostly you will have a lot of emails to write and multiple logs to check. Salary growth can be slow ( as far as I am aware 10-18% is standard) however if your communication with management is positive and your manager assures you then it can be worth the wait. Exponential increment after a span of 2-3 years is common I have heard. This will vary a lot based on an individual's exp and work they have put in so not really a con. Lot of mandatory trainings :-P"

The additional stress and attempt to normalize the fear of losing your job constantly.. NO THANK YOU. Also huge RTP presence means lots of conservative, christian republicans. Lots of work needed in the D&I space. No formal review, no chance of promotion. People are treated as replaceable resources. 3 managers in 2 years. Didnt see a single team mate promoted in 3 years, even people that had been there 6+ years. Employees have Stockholm syndrome, “feel so lucky they survived the last LR”. The pay is horrrrible for the bay area and they do not give annual increases.. period. If youre lucky youll get a promotion every 5 years.

Application operation,2.0,"Dec 29, 2022","Former employee, more than 8 years","- High caliber employees with high caliber results delivered - Great learning and development opportunities at all levels provided by Cisco - Great people that generally care about one another depending upon the department - Personally progressed several levels within my career, as a woman, with generally good support and coaching from leadership - Cisco tries to take care of their employees even in the hardest times such as redundancies - Work life balance could be good if you are in a supportive department allowing it","- Over the years as an acquisition of Cisco, they massively struggled with what to do with the AppD business. This had a major impact on innovation, strategy, and stable leadership of the AppD business. - Over the past year, Cisco is heavily focused on further integration of the AppD business creating fear-based dynamics of employees concerned about their job, pushiness when it comes to strategy moves, lack of care about impact to AppD functions and capacity drain on employees. - No psychological safety within the business at present - Employees that have been within the AppD business for years are expendable to Cisco; All executive leadership have exited and they are bringing in ""Cisco people"" to take over. - Some direction now in strategy, but who knows how long that will last as the trend as been to move in a certain direction and then it doesn't work out. As a hardware company, Cisco is struggling with what to do with AppD from a strategy perspective. - Work/life balance is a struggle in the Operations functions as Cisco tightens their purse strings but keeps dumping loads of work/expectations on an already lean team - Sales culture is very stressed due to all the extra burden being placed on them from an admin and process-oriented perspective. In addition, Enablement of Sales teams is a mess and creates confusion for Sales more than sets them up for success. - Extremely hard to get pay increases within teams for high performers. Wages are based on Cisco banding as a hardware company and Software companies in the market are offering significantly higher wages for the same roles. - Once Cisco came in to take over in the last year, they stopped listening to the advice of most tenured team members within AppD who knew the AppD business best. They made decisions without thinking of the impact for those ""on the ground"" doing the work. - New product launches going out without being fully operationalized. Rushed to market due to being behind and needing to catch up. Creating impact to Sales and potentially customer experience."

It's a two-edged sword, but having the option to take a WebEx from home, Starbucks, airports, the beach, or in the office ... permits a level of versatility -- and fully acceptable by colleagues and management -- that would be hard to repeat elsewhere.  It's part of the culture.  The flipside is that work more easily creeps into your personal space and follows you on vacation if you're not careful.  Another consequence is that Cisco offices can feel like ghost towns.

Cisco has an immensely successful and rich portfolio and is well-positioned for the future.  But ... for the past few years, it has felt like Cisco is constantly trying to turn a corner ... and never quite making it.","The biggest con nowadays is that Cisco is trying vigorously to grow income faster than revenue.  This translates to what seems like a never ending round of budget cuts and divestment.  Workforce reductions are becoming more common than pay raises and the value proposition to working here is becoming harder to defend.

Consulting systems engineer,4.0,"Dec 11, 2015","Current employee, more than 8 years","Cisco is a fun place to work, at least if you're in the sales part of the business. You can usually work from home and take flexible hours provided you're serving your customers well.

Career options are great, you can move around the business relatively easily. Opportunities to move to different countries are frequent and often encouraged.

Lots of opportunities to do side projects and define your own activities. Very little 'micro-managing'.

Rewards outside of base pay are encouraged and easy to distribute, creating a good culture with positive feedback.","No inflationary payrises. Very difficult to get promotions without being a skilled political operative. Managers powerless to help employees in this area as they don't control any budget. Everything goes through a big HR machine. Everything and everyone is a number and cost to be reduced.

Managers are usually looking upwards focussed on their own careers, not paying attention to their employees. Can go months without a performance review or any guidance as to your own career. Promotions, payrises etc all shrouded in secrecy.

Leavers usually not replaced, or replaced slowly. Being 5 heads down is common and workload thrown to employees without any consultation or apology. This in turn affects sales commission.

Technical strategy is weak in areas due to massive in-fightning between business units. Huge egos run parts of the business. Fear is a frequently used motivational tool."

The early days were the best when you actually worked as part of a team. I learned a lot and enjoyed the work/life balance. The continuous training available was always top-notch. If you want to find someplace to hide and retire, there are plenty of dark holes in Cisco to do it.","Too much turnover! Senior people are put in positions they should not hold and this includes the majority of management. If you are not in your director's inner circle then you may as well pack your bags. To get into the inner circle you just have to play the game, kiss the right behinds, and squawk a lot. You don't actually have to work, you just have to be a puppet. If you dance enough little monkey, they may toss you a shilling. The ""People Deal"" and ""Stack Rank"" are horrendous and just created a cutthroat mentality, absolutely destroying teams. Lay-offs every 6 months, re-org every 2-3 years, and complete restructuring every 4-5 are exhausting!"
