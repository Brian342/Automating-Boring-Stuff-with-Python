"Manager, network services",4.0,"Mar 13, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Systems engineer,3.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years","Overall, Cisco is a good place to work. As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.","If you end up with a manager who manipulates systems and relationships—undermining direct reports, peers, and even superiors to secure promotion or survival—the only real option is to leave. Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.

Cisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of ground-level realities."
Strategy & planning,4.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Former employee,"Grow and learn with some genuinely smart and capable folks
Prestige of working for the market leader
Stays innovative through some great external acquisitions
Good internal tools and work resources
Overall a supportive company culture","The 'old guard' of Cisco can be quite bureaucratic and political. You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.

After a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.

It's a big company (~80K employees). Things can get lost."
Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco offers a truly flexible hybrid work environment, which makes it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The team I work with is incredibly supportive, collaborative, and open to new ideas. The culture promotes learning, growth, and inclusion. Leadership is approachable and transparent. Overall, it's a positive and empowering place to work.",None so far – I've had a great experience.

Program manager,1.0,"May 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","As a Programme Manager at Cisco, my role involved school visits and leading the LittleBigAwards campaign.","I made the difficult decision to leave Cisco because I wanted to work in an environment where accessibility, inclusion, and opportunities for growth were prioritised. While I appreciated many aspects of the company, the lack of true disability inclusion and the ongoing uncertainty from constant reorganisations pushed me to seek a more supportive and empowering workplace."
Data scientist,2.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Chill work life balance and long paternity leave if you need it.,"I felt it was a cost cutting place. 
Did not even have company sponsored team dinners and no one knows which direction to work on. Sort of like a ruder less ship.
It did not feel like a top IT place. It had a lot of very average people most of whom had only masters from only a few select colleges i.e. the ones that the seniors belonged to. Low level of tech expertise is needed and most higher level people didn't understand much advanced ML stuff. Much higher importance was given to visibility than actual innovation and being managers pet will take you a long way."

Product sales specialist,2.0,"May 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years",None. Hope it could be better.,"The decision-making style within this historic IT company often reminds me of the unpredictability seen in broad policy shifts like the Trump-era tariffs — top-down directives issued without adequate consideration for on-the-ground realities. In some cases, organizational restructures have been implemented without fully understanding product segmentation, technical distinctions, or how various solutions align with customer needs. This has led to inefficiencies and friction among teams.

There’s also a noticeable tendency toward rigid, hierarchical leadership — occasionally influenced by a militaristic mindset — which can stifle open communication and discourage constructive feedback. When leadership becomes overly dominant or insulated, particularly at the regional level, it hampers effective decision-making and fosters an unhealthy work environment.

Moreover, the company’s global alignment remains inconsistent. Reporting lines still vary by country, and unequal treatment of product-side teams by account-side stakeholders reflects broader issues in organizational equity. These structural imbalances need to be addressed to create a truly collaborative and fair working culture."

Engineering leader,5.0,"May 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","I honestly can't speak highly enough about my experience at Cisco. From day one, it's been clear that this is a company that genuinely prioritizes its employees.

The Work-Life Balance (WLB) is truly outstanding – it's not just a buzzword here, it's deeply ingrained in the culture. Leadership actively encourages you to disconnect, take time off, and manage your schedule flexibly. Whether it's managing family commitments, personal appointments, or just needing time to recharge, Cisco provides the flexibility and support to ensure work seamlessly integrates into your life, rather than dominating it. Burnout is not a factor here; instead, there's a strong emphasis on sustainable productivity and employee well-being.

Compensation and Benefits are also exceptionally good. The pay is highly competitive, reflecting the value employees bring. Beyond a great base salary, the comprehensive benefits package (health, 401k match, generous PTO, and potential for bonuses/RSUs) is fantastic. I feel truly valued and fairly compensated for my contributions.

Beyond these two major points, the culture is incredibly collaborative and supportive. You're surrounded by brilliant, kind, and approachable colleagues. There are ample opportunities for learning and growth, whether through internal programs, mentorship, or working on cutting-edge projects. Cisco's commitment to innovation and social impact (diversity, sustainability) also makes it a truly rewarding place to work. It's a company where you can feel proud of what you're contributing to.""","Honestly, it's genuinely challenging to pinpoint any significant 'cons' that detract from the overwhelmingly positive experience at Cisco. My experience here has consistently exceeded expectations. If I had to stretch to identify a 'con,' perhaps the sheer size of the organization means navigating certain internal processes can sometimes take a moment, but teams are always helpful and resources are abundant. This is a truly minor point within a sea of positives."

No one knows the system well enough in depth, and when changes are made to one flow, it's not always possible to predict how other flows will be affected.

- Exposure to a wide range of IT and cybersecurity products. Free certifications & courses that are recognised worldwide.
- You’ll learn a lot—mostly because you’re forced to wear multiple hats.
- Lots of GREAT colleagues who try to support each other under pressure. They're some of the nicest workmates you'll ever end up working with.","- After the mass layoff, workloads doubled, but salaries stayed the same. Management’s answer: ""budget constraints."" Nothing changes - well, not in your favour anyways. But policy and workload changes? A lot.
- You're expected to do more than what you were officially hired for - lead generation, qualification, technical guidance, account creation, and pseudo-account management—but you're still treated and paid like a basic lead qualifier. Commissions are even capped. Imagine closing a deal more than 600k in a single week, but your commission didn't even reflect 1% of that achievement. Instead, rewards are given in the form of cash vouchers or gift cards.
- That being said; no career growth & no clear progression from management. Lots of GREAT people have left just because you're so busy focusing on the wrong things. You're punishing TOP achievers just because they don't follow your note-keeping style?? ridiculous.
- Recognition is scarce. You keep the engine running, but it feels like you’re invisible unless something goes wrong. Each quarterly meeting is spent on celebrating wins that didn't even reflect back to the team members' contribution.
- ""Work-life balance"" is for other teams & upper management. For the rest of us, it's 5 days in the office & you can only make calls at your own desk, not in any of the designated quiet room. Reason being: they want to SEE & HEAR you make the calls. As if we don't use recording tools. Micromanagement at its peak.
- Leadership is disconnected from day-to-day struggles. Feedback feels like it goes into a black hole. Pointless. Weekly check ins? Useless."

Super learning opportunities and great technologies","CCBU is generally a great place to work, but unfortunately, a few handful unfit so called managers have severely impacted the environment. In some teams, the toxicity is particularly rampant, and it goes unchecked because two individuals are enabling unethical behavior , and its unchecked totally, as developers fear their job , as they will threathen them with dire consequences.

Person KK, who is abusive and egotistical, constantly demands respect, claiming to be the key to the team’s success while threatening others with consequences, if he is not respected. Person NS, a close friend of K's wife, that everyone must support him, and blindly will follow him, technically NS himself will not know anything.

In this dysfunctional environment, any task that doesn't get done is automatically attributed by a threat to talk to KK. The team works tirelessly, yet NS takes all the credit, while KK rewards him for it and never the team. If you don’t meet expectations, NS will relentlessly contact you—calling, texting, and reach out non stop on whats-app and even reaching out to your family, all while disregarding any personal boundaries. 

N's only role seems to be demanding ETAs with no planning or structure, undermining Cisco’s otherwise amazing culture.

This stressful environemnt persists only because both K and N protect each other’s interests. I was ill and I could not even get up, my father was contacted on phone as to where is your son and while I was sick with a high fever. The mental stress I endured is ongoing as only one person listens who is in USA, and he is unaware of these folks. As a developer I am not able to work on new technologies and upcomign features and techstack.
Thats how talent dies.
My peers in Vendor company were tortured mentally even in pregnancy.

Cisco is a wonderful company, but this one team under Kk and N’s so called titled leadership is a glaring exception."

The program was once an esteemed and highly respected path for early-career development, but unfortunately, things have gone downhill under the current management.","Leadership has been particularly problematic. He is difficult to work with, and I personally observed a sexist bias within the program. It was clear that male participants were promoted more frequently than women, which was a shared concern among my graduating class.

The program consists of four rotations and four LIFT academies. While these academies are meant to support development, in practice, they lack fairness. Assessments are inconsistent, and favoritism is common. Performance doesn’t always seem to matter. For instance, the “top performer” in my group was actually absent on vacation for a large part of the timeline, and despite multiple complaints about their performance, program management ignored these concerns and selected that person as the only one from our group to receive LIFT honors.

The current class is regarded as having a poor attitude, often logging in after 11 a.m. and frequently complaining. 

Overall, if you're one of Tim’s favorites, you may have a smoother path, but if not, expect to face politics rather than professional growth. The LIFT Program needs strong, unbiased leadership to restore its reputation and value."

+ salary (around 110% of the average)
+ occasional trips to the office (once every 5-6 months) fully paid by the company","+ Individual performance (your customers' satisfaction and review etc.) is overshadowed by your reputation. It takes one person's negative opinion about you to lose a big portion of a pay rise. In other words, you need to behave like the company wants you to behave. This is why criticism is not welcomed in practice.
+ little to no opportunities in some departments and locations, Poland especially
+ a lot of bureocracy
+ work flexibility (schedule/calendar) is getting lower with each year. I.e. In theory you can move lunch slots to other hour, but in reality the system does not allow for that as there is not enough staff at almost every hour of the day."

Marketing manager,1.0,"Mar 22, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years","Good work-life balance.
Flexible working arrangements.
Average benefits.","Cisco has become an extremely unstable company. Every year I worked there, there were layoffs, and now layoffs have become a regular occurrence. In my last year alone, there were three rounds of layoffs, which clearly indicates that management lacks direction. Instead of implementing a strong long-term strategy, leadership continuously resorts to downsizing, showing a complete lack of vision for the company's future.

Additionally, many management and director-level roles are assigned to individuals with little to no relevant experience. This leads to poor decision-making and a lack of leadership. Collaboration between teams is nearly nonexistent, with constant conflicts between the so-called global teams and regional teams. The work environment is toxic, and promotions are not based on hard work or expertise but rather on internal connections and favoritism.

Salaries are below industry average, and salary increases are rare. If you're expecting regular raises, good luck—because they barely happen. Any employee benefits or initiatives seem to be purely for show rather than genuine care for employees. One glaring example was when the company was publicly celebrating being voted a ""Best Place to Work"" in the morning, only to start laying off employees that same afternoon. This was handled in an unprofessional and insensitive manner, proving that most of Cisco's employee initiatives are just for appearances.

Internal structures and processes are outdated and dysfunctional, yet no one takes meaningful action to fix them. Instead of addressing inefficiencies, the company always chooses the easy way out—layoffs. They don't even attempt to reallocate employees to other internal positions when teams are restructured. Instead, they lay off existing employees and hire new ones for similar roles.

If you don’t mind constant instability, poor leadership, and a company that prioritizes image over employee well-being, then Cisco might be the place for you. But if you’re looking for long-term stability and career growth, I’d advise looking elsewhere."

The supportive and innovative environment made each project exciting, and the team dynamic was inspiring. I would gladly work with Cisco again, as it was a place where professional growth and meaningful connections thrived.","While Cisco provided a generous severance and treated layoffs with respect and dignity, the company’s periodic restructuring can create uncertainty.

- Mostly competitive pay
- Decent opportunity for movement
- Fully remote

- Lots of meetings, but that's just remote tech life
- An already silo'd company feels extra silo'd when we are basically all remote
- Projects might not truly see the light of day, but that's the cold corporate world for you
- Can be hard to get converted from a contractor to a full-time employee

Big stuff:
- Executive leadership is ignorant of how people lower down the totem pole work. Or worse yet, they just don't care. Recent layoffs that hit the part of the company that had been meeting projections are laughable. All in the name of ""optimizing for growth around AI""
- Layoffs are happening twice a year at this point. TWICE. And they aren't small either. The ""always be hiring, always be firing"" method feels terrifying to work under.
- Cisco is a dinosaur (old) company. I think their focus on AI will lead them nowhere since there's no way they can keep up with the more modern, agile tech companies."

The teams are usually driven by certain groups of people who have the invisible ""authority"" and ""power"". The work is busy, but it's because of the disorganized and non-feedback work. This is due to the nature of ""solo"" work, e.g. This guy A handles feature X and he usually the only ""go-to"" person for X, no matter if there may be some better approach or at least some chances for guy A to receive feedback. Guy A won't likely know (and may not have time to care) what the guy B is working on.

Their glory years are behind them and all their major product lines are under attack by strong competitors. Some senior management is trying to change the company culture and fight back in the market by pushing Meraki to the front of the product line, but Meraki by itself is not an answer. The problems are deep and structural and they require knowledgeable, fearless leaders to make any progress. Unfortunately for Cisco, those are few and far between. I watched several good people try to make progress on substantial issues, all to have them generally fail. Most VPs have a relatively cushy job and are just milking the compensation package while Rome burns."
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years",Used to be great place,"Internal to Cisco. Huge organisational restructuring every couple of years with redundancies. Has lost the way that made it great. 

Chaos has ensued during each restructuring. Several board level leaders have left. Last minute decisions and chop changing by ELT because of poor decisions and inability to keep to long term plans.

The phrase care deeply is coined by ELT. Almost verging on a brain washing and gas lighting process because the actions do not match:

Announcing redundancies, then waiting 4 weeks before starting. leaving employee in the dark and creating huge amounts of stress.

Middle managers and employees are being squeezed, creating a toxic workplace. Employees forced into the list below. Fearful of saying anything, due to the every 2 year redundancies:

	• Accept targets that are over 4 months late and repay commissions retroactively.
	•	Cover increased number of product lines, despite inadequate training on the new offerings.
	•	Meet significantly increased targets, sometimes 6x or more.
	•	Take on multiple roles due to ongoing layoffs over the past year.

• No voluntary redundancy so accept all the above or leave of your own accord. 
• No training program to re-skill talent into new growth areas. Would rather fire and hire.

No pay increase to reflect these additional responsibilities."

Job security has been a big issue since 2022.

The company fosters a collaborative environment with extensive resources for learning and career advancement, as well as strong mentorship programs and a commitment to employee well-being. Many employees appreciate Cisco’s focus on work-life balance, flexible work arrangements, and inclusive culture, which can make it an appealing workplace for those seeking stability and growth in the tech industry.","As a large, global corporation, Cisco’s size can sometimes mean that navigating internal processes and decision-making can be slow, with layers of bureaucracy that may delay project approvals or adaptability to change. This structure may feel limiting for employees who prefer a more agile, startup-like environment. Additionally, some teams can experience a high level of demand and fast-paced work, which may occasionally impact work-life balance depending on the project and department."

* Large variety or products to work on with some internal mobility opportunities
* Great place to learn how things work in a 'real' company with exposure to many groups and functions","* Slow. It's a large corporate with more processes & policies than people.
* The leadership team is too politically correct - always trying to say the 'right thing' so as not to upset anyone. Sadly. this has the opposite effect than is intended. There are multiple groups within the company actively hostile towards others.
* The long term strategies never seem to work, since every 1-2 years there is 'another restructuring' and the share price simply stagnates
* Many products & processes are still hardware focused - don't come here looking for a fast-pased innovative environment (it might exist in small parts of Cisco, but it's not the overall culture)"

Great salary and benefits, I have an amazing team, and I personally see my impact across the company. These are all great qualities and why I would never want to leave. I could retire here…. But see cons.","It is a layoff culture. “Cognitive dissonance” are the two words employees should note as leadership fails to respect us in words what their behavior is communicating (see cisco’s response on 12/9, “committed to retaining talent” (paraphrased). It’s simply not true by their actions.

I think in the past four years I have experienced six layoffs and so far survived them all. The reality though is that we always know these layoffs are around the corner, and when the news is leaked (which it always is) people freak out (understandably!). Our last layoff required three+ months of not knowing who would have a job—that’s not going to help our bottom line (but I think is tied to a regulation). 

Though, root cause is not the timeline. It’s the layoff and (I think unintentional) dishonesty that kills me and has me in a bind—I love this company, but my stress can’t handle this company. I have a family to feed. 

Also, leadership is a bit out of touch. In the last layoff they remarked the percentage cut they would receive in bonus, which still resulted in multi million salaries (which was commented on in the chat as it happened, with the receipts… ouch!). That’s not consolation for the person who relies on their check to stay housed and feed their family, especially in this oversaturated market."

Flexible Working Hours:
The company offers flexible working hours, which has been a significant benefit. Employees are allowed to start and finish their workdays at times that suit their personal schedules, as long as they meet project deadlines and attend necessary meetings.

Remote Work Options:
Since the pandemic, Cisco has adopted a hybrid work model. Employees have the option to work from home several days a week, which greatly reduces commuting time and allows for a more comfortable and productive work environment.

Vacation and Time Off:
The company provides generous vacation days and encourages employees to use them. I never felt pressured to skip my vacations, and management genuinely supports taking time off to recharge.

Health and Wellness Programs:
Cisco offers various health and wellness programs, including gym memberships, yoga classes, and mental health resources. These programs are a testament to the company's commitment to the well-being of its employees.

The products that Cisco makes are phenomenal.","As a sales rep, you really have no control over what territory you cover, and what accounts you have this year to next. If you are not Enterprise sales rep, you could spend the entire year trying to develop a relationship with an account, only to find out that you no longer cover it when the new fiscal comes around. The goals drastically change, with no warrant to why or how they came up with this number. Finance also will regoal you and keep all your money. Mid-level management also has little to no control or say into how things are managed or done. Cisco sells against itself.

That person takes the baton to talk about whatever jargon the company is into at the moment without making any differences.

Cisco provides a lot of resources and opportunities to explore what you uniquely bring to your work, lead with your strengths, practice mindfulness, and keep balance and flexibility in your life. It is a place that strives to be welcoming and supportive of diverse communities with a lot of employee resource groups to help. Their benefits are great and receiving 80 hrs per year to volunteer is simply amazing. I hope they don't cut that back.","The PTO is 20 days per year, but you are forced to use 3-4 for those days during the mandatory holiday shutdown period, so the PTO is effectively 16 or 17 days. 
They have had a lot of unannounced layoffs or ""restructuring"" since I joined.
And like any large corporation, a lot of the internal processes and requirements are like navigating a maze to follow. 
It is also very slow to move and coming from an acquisition this was a hard transition. Also, when we were acquired, we thought we would get more resources to help, but that was not the case.

Then you are placed into a team within the 5 specialized areas in TAC: Service Provider, Enterprise, Security, Datacenter, and Collaboration.

Senior business analyst,1.0,"Sep 20, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Employee culture at the individual contributor level is fantastic.

Work/Life Balance is good.","Back to laying off every 6 months. The most likely reason you will get laid off is ""this year's executive"" for your function wants to do things differently. Or your team is marooned in the wrong organization. How did your team get marooned? From last year's executive's re-org. Being re-orged into IT or Operations is a common death sentence and you should begin a 6 month exit plan as soon as it happens.

Leadership couldn't answer a ""How to return to growth?"" question after the most recent layoff. CEO had a ""hope in 6 months"" answer. Services EVP had a word salad. This was a seeded question in a moderated forum. Newly appointed Chief Product Officer is coming from a lackluster division (WebEx) and admitted to knowing nothing about Enterprise Networking.
