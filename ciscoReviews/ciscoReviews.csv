"Manager, network services",4.0,"Mar 13, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Systems engineer,3.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years","Overall, Cisco is a good place to work. As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.","If you end up with a manager who manipulates systems and relationships—undermining direct reports, peers, and even superiors to secure promotion or survival—the only real option is to leave. Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.

Cisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of ground-level realities."
Strategy & planning,4.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Former employee,"Grow and learn with some genuinely smart and capable folks
Prestige of working for the market leader
Stays innovative through some great external acquisitions
Good internal tools and work resources
Overall a supportive company culture","The 'old guard' of Cisco can be quite bureaucratic and political. You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.

After a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.

It's a big company (~80K employees). Things can get lost."
Human resources,3.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years",People are collaborative. Nice culture.,Frequency of lay-offs are destabilizing
Solutions engineer,4.0,"Aug 10, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",Great culture for the most part. I know it mainly depends on your team but most leaders aren’t terrible.,It sense like the powers that be don’t understand advertising and public sentiment
Program manager,1.0,"May 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","As a Programme Manager at Cisco, my role involved school visits and leading the LittleBigAwards campaign.","I made the difficult decision to leave Cisco because I wanted to work in an environment where accessibility, inclusion, and opportunities for growth were prioritised. While I appreciated many aspects of the company, the lack of true disability inclusion and the ongoing uncertainty from constant reorganisations pushed me to seek a more supportive and empowering workplace."
Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco offers a truly flexible hybrid work environment, which makes it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The team I work with is incredibly supportive, collaborative, and open to new ideas. The culture promotes learning, growth, and inclusion. Leadership is approachable and transparent. Overall, it's a positive and empowering place to work.",None so far – I've had a great experience.

Data scientist,2.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Chill work life balance and long paternity leave if you need it.,"I felt it was a cost cutting place. 
Did not even have company sponsored team dinners and no one knows which direction to work on. Sort of like a ruder less ship.
It did not feel like a top IT place. It had a lot of very average people most of whom had only masters from only a few select colleges i.e. the ones that the seniors belonged to. Low level of tech expertise is needed and most higher level people didn't understand much advanced ML stuff. Much higher importance was given to visibility than actual innovation and being managers pet will take you a long way."

Product sales specialist,2.0,"May 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years",None. Hope it could be better.,"The decision-making style within this historic IT company often reminds me of the unpredictability seen in broad policy shifts like the Trump-era tariffs — top-down directives issued without adequate consideration for on-the-ground realities. In some cases, organizational restructures have been implemented without fully understanding product segmentation, technical distinctions, or how various solutions align with customer needs. This has led to inefficiencies and friction among teams.

There’s also a noticeable tendency toward rigid, hierarchical leadership — occasionally influenced by a militaristic mindset — which can stifle open communication and discourage constructive feedback. When leadership becomes overly dominant or insulated, particularly at the regional level, it hampers effective decision-making and fosters an unhealthy work environment.

Moreover, the company’s global alignment remains inconsistent. Reporting lines still vary by country, and unequal treatment of product-side teams by account-side stakeholders reflects broader issues in organizational equity. These structural imbalances need to be addressed to create a truly collaborative and fair working culture."

Engineering leader,5.0,"May 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","I honestly can't speak highly enough about my experience at Cisco. From day one, it's been clear that this is a company that genuinely prioritizes its employees.

The Work-Life Balance (WLB) is truly outstanding – it's not just a buzzword here, it's deeply ingrained in the culture. Leadership actively encourages you to disconnect, take time off, and manage your schedule flexibly. Whether it's managing family commitments, personal appointments, or just needing time to recharge, Cisco provides the flexibility and support to ensure work seamlessly integrates into your life, rather than dominating it. Burnout is not a factor here; instead, there's a strong emphasis on sustainable productivity and employee well-being.

Compensation and Benefits are also exceptionally good. The pay is highly competitive, reflecting the value employees bring. Beyond a great base salary, the comprehensive benefits package (health, 401k match, generous PTO, and potential for bonuses/RSUs) is fantastic. I feel truly valued and fairly compensated for my contributions.

Beyond these two major points, the culture is incredibly collaborative and supportive. You're surrounded by brilliant, kind, and approachable colleagues. There are ample opportunities for learning and growth, whether through internal programs, mentorship, or working on cutting-edge projects. Cisco's commitment to innovation and social impact (diversity, sustainability) also makes it a truly rewarding place to work. It's a company where you can feel proud of what you're contributing to.""","Honestly, it's genuinely challenging to pinpoint any significant 'cons' that detract from the overwhelmingly positive experience at Cisco. My experience here has consistently exceeded expectations. If I had to stretch to identify a 'con,' perhaps the sheer size of the organization means navigating certain internal processes can sometimes take a moment, but teams are always helpful and resources are abundant. This is a truly minor point within a sea of positives."

The people in Cisco are mostly exceptional to work with and a highlight of working there.","Some roles became overwhelming as each year you were expected to do more with less resources.  Key sales resources would be taken away or there'd be hiring freezes and you'd have to pick up the slack and were expected to overachieve on your sales goal.  Cisco could do a better job making information about employee development programs known as they have various programs, but sometimes you just find out randomly through word of mouth. Even if someone needs to be nominated for a program, the employees should know they exist."

- Exposure to a wide range of IT and cybersecurity products. Free certifications & courses that are recognised worldwide.
- You’ll learn a lot—mostly because you’re forced to wear multiple hats.
- Lots of GREAT colleagues who try to support each other under pressure. They're some of the nicest workmates you'll ever end up working with.","- After the mass layoff, workloads doubled, but salaries stayed the same. Management’s answer: ""budget constraints."" Nothing changes - well, not in your favour anyways. But policy and workload changes? A lot.
- You're expected to do more than what you were officially hired for - lead generation, qualification, technical guidance, account creation, and pseudo-account management—but you're still treated and paid like a basic lead qualifier. Commissions are even capped. Imagine closing a deal more than 600k in a single week, but your commission didn't even reflect 1% of that achievement. Instead, rewards are given in the form of cash vouchers or gift cards.
- That being said; no career growth & no clear progression from management. Lots of GREAT people have left just because you're so busy focusing on the wrong things. You're punishing TOP achievers just because they don't follow your note-keeping style?? ridiculous.
- Recognition is scarce. You keep the engine running, but it feels like you’re invisible unless something goes wrong. Each quarterly meeting is spent on celebrating wins that didn't even reflect back to the team members' contribution.
- ""Work-life balance"" is for other teams & upper management. For the rest of us, it's 5 days in the office & you can only make calls at your own desk, not in any of the designated quiet room. Reason being: they want to SEE & HEAR you make the calls. As if we don't use recording tools. Micromanagement at its peak.
- Leadership is disconnected from day-to-day struggles. Feedback feels like it goes into a black hole. Pointless. Weekly check ins? Useless."

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 7, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Amazing Cisco culture and growth opportunities, best globally. 
Super learning opportunities and great technologies","CCBU is generally a great place to work, but unfortunately, a few handful unfit so called managers have severely impacted the environment. In some teams, the toxicity is particularly rampant, and it goes unchecked because two individuals are enabling unethical behavior , and its unchecked totally, as developers fear their job , as they will threathen them with dire consequences.

Person KK, who is abusive and egotistical, constantly demands respect, claiming to be the key to the team’s success while threatening others with consequences, if he is not respected. Person NS, a close friend of K's wife, that everyone must support him, and blindly will follow him, technically NS himself will not know anything.

In this dysfunctional environment, any task that doesn't get done is automatically attributed by a threat to talk to KK. The team works tirelessly, yet NS takes all the credit, while KK rewards him for it and never the team. If you don’t meet expectations, NS will relentlessly contact you—calling, texting, and reach out non stop on whats-app and even reaching out to your family, all while disregarding any personal boundaries. 

N's only role seems to be demanding ETAs with no planning or structure, undermining Cisco’s otherwise amazing culture.

This stressful environemnt persists only because both K and N protect each other’s interests. I was ill and I could not even get up, my father was contacted on phone as to where is your son and while I was sick with a high fever. The mental stress I endured is ongoing as only one person listens who is in USA, and he is unaware of these folks. As a developer I am not able to work on new technologies and upcomign features and techstack.
Thats how talent dies.
My peers in Vendor company were tortured mentally even in pregnancy.

Cisco is a wonderful company, but this one team under Kk and N’s so called titled leadership is a glaring exception."

"Leaders in finance and technology (lift), financial analyst",2.0,"Nov 15, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","I completed Cisco's LIFT Program and was initially excited by its strong reputation in the Cisco community. The program was once an esteemed and highly respected path for early-career development, but unfortunately, things have gone downhill under the current management.","Leadership has been particularly problematic. He is difficult to work with, and I personally observed a sexist bias within the program. It was clear that male participants were promoted more frequently than women, which was a shared concern among my graduating class.

The program consists of four rotations and four LIFT academies. While these academies are meant to support development, in practice, they lack fairness. Assessments are inconsistent, and favoritism is common. Performance doesn’t always seem to matter. For instance, the “top performer” in my group was actually absent on vacation for a large part of the timeline, and despite multiple complaints about their performance, program management ignored these concerns and selected that person as the only one from our group to receive LIFT honors.

The current class is regarded as having a poor attitude, often logging in after 11 a.m. and frequently complaining. 

Overall, if you're one of Tim’s favorites, you may have a smoother path, but if not, expect to face politics rather than professional growth. The LIFT Program needs strong, unbiased leadership to restore its reputation and value."

+ salary (around 110% of the average)
+ occasional trips to the office (once every 5-6 months) fully paid by the company","+ Individual performance (your customers' satisfaction and review etc.) is overshadowed by your reputation. It takes one person's negative opinion about you to lose a big portion of a pay rise. In other words, you need to behave like the company wants you to behave. This is why criticism is not welcomed in practice.
+ little to no opportunities in some departments and locations, Poland especially
+ a lot of bureocracy
+ work flexibility (schedule/calendar) is getting lower with each year. I.e. In theory you can move lunch slots to other hour, but in reality the system does not allow for that as there is not enough staff at almost every hour of the day."

I have been here almost 10 years and it was the company I planned to retire with, but with all the recent change people are silently quitting. There is still alot of good going on but it gets harder to see it when there is so much negative impact and people are so unhappy.","The company has changed the compensation model so many times over the last few years I can't even count - There is no budget to travel. I run a sales team that supports America and literally am given 1,500/ quarter for each seller to support their customers in person. This is a joke and it has been going on for 4 quarters. Also the compensation model for all sellers is terrible. Cisco pays a decelerated amount until sellers hit 50% of their number then from 50-75% a slight accelerated number to make up for the decelerator - then paid out at 100% once seller hits 75%. This is terrible especially for GES and public sector sellers who many times pull in 30-50% of their revenue in Q4. Not to mention we have lay off's constantly and 0 stability at the SLT level .

Flexible working arrangements.
Average benefits.","Cisco has become an extremely unstable company. Every year I worked there, there were layoffs, and now layoffs have become a regular occurrence. In my last year alone, there were three rounds of layoffs, which clearly indicates that management lacks direction. Instead of implementing a strong long-term strategy, leadership continuously resorts to downsizing, showing a complete lack of vision for the company's future.

Additionally, many management and director-level roles are assigned to individuals with little to no relevant experience. This leads to poor decision-making and a lack of leadership. Collaboration between teams is nearly nonexistent, with constant conflicts between the so-called global teams and regional teams. The work environment is toxic, and promotions are not based on hard work or expertise but rather on internal connections and favoritism.

Salaries are below industry average, and salary increases are rare. If you're expecting regular raises, good luck—because they barely happen. Any employee benefits or initiatives seem to be purely for show rather than genuine care for employees. One glaring example was when the company was publicly celebrating being voted a ""Best Place to Work"" in the morning, only to start laying off employees that same afternoon. This was handled in an unprofessional and insensitive manner, proving that most of Cisco's employee initiatives are just for appearances.

Internal structures and processes are outdated and dysfunctional, yet no one takes meaningful action to fix them. Instead of addressing inefficiencies, the company always chooses the easy way out—layoffs. They don't even attempt to reallocate employees to other internal positions when teams are restructured. Instead, they lay off existing employees and hire new ones for similar roles.

If you don’t mind constant instability, poor leadership, and a company that prioritizes image over employee well-being, then Cisco might be the place for you. But if you’re looking for long-term stability and career growth, I’d advise looking elsewhere."

- Mostly competitive pay
- Decent opportunity for movement
- Fully remote
- Fantastic individual contributor culture","Small stuff:
- Lots of meetings, but that's just remote tech life
- An already silo'd company feels extra silo'd when we are basically all remote
- Projects might not truly see the light of day, but that's the cold corporate world for you
- Can be hard to get converted from a contractor to a full-time employee

Big stuff:
- Executive leadership is ignorant of how people lower down the totem pole work. Or worse yet, they just don't care. Recent layoffs that hit the part of the company that had been meeting projections are laughable. All in the name of ""optimizing for growth around AI""
- Layoffs are happening twice a year at this point. TWICE. And they aren't small either. The ""always be hiring, always be firing"" method feels terrifying to work under.
- Cisco is a dinosaur (old) company. I think their focus on AI will lead them nowhere since there's no way they can keep up with the more modern, agile tech companies."

The teams are usually driven by certain groups of people who have the invisible ""authority"" and ""power"". The work is busy, but it's because of the disorganized and non-feedback work. This is due to the nature of ""solo"" work, e.g. This guy A handles feature X and he usually the only ""go-to"" person for X, no matter if there may be some better approach or at least some chances for guy A to receive feedback.

Some senior management is trying to change the company culture and fight back in the market by pushing Meraki to the front of the product line, but Meraki by itself is not an answer. The problems are deep and structural and they require knowledgeable, fearless leaders to make any progress. Unfortunately for Cisco, those are few and far between.

Chaos has ensued during each restructuring. Several board level leaders have left. Last minute decisions and chop changing by ELT because of poor decisions and inability to keep to long term plans.

The phrase care deeply is coined by ELT. Almost verging on a brain washing and gas lighting process because the actions do not match:

Announcing redundancies, then waiting 4 weeks before starting. leaving employee in the dark and creating huge amounts of stress.

Middle managers and employees are being squeezed, creating a toxic workplace. Employees forced into the list below. Fearful of saying anything, due to the every 2 year redundancies:

	• Accept targets that are over 4 months late and repay commissions retroactively.
	•	Cover increased number of product lines, despite inadequate training on the new offerings.
	•	Meet significantly increased targets, sometimes 6x or more.
	•	Take on multiple roles due to ongoing layoffs over the past year.

• No voluntary redundancy so accept all the above or leave of your own accord. 
• No training program to re-skill talent into new growth areas. Would rather fire and hire.

No pay increase to reflect these additional responsibilities."

Many employees appreciate Cisco’s focus on work-life balance, flexible work arrangements, and inclusive culture, which can make it an appealing workplace for those seeking stability and growth in the tech industry.","As a large, global corporation, Cisco’s size can sometimes mean that navigating internal processes and decision-making can be slow, with layers of bureaucracy that may delay project approvals or adaptability to change.

At least 3 that I am aware of. New hires are often chosen for this because they are largely more replaceable than engineers that have been there for 10+ years and are local experts that would be very hard to replace.

Great salary and benefits, I have an amazing team, and I personally see my impact across the company. These are all great qualities and why I would never want to leave. I could retire here…. But see cons.","It is a layoff culture. “Cognitive dissonance” are the two words employees should note as leadership fails to respect us in words what their behavior is communicating (see cisco’s response on 12/9, “committed to retaining talent” (paraphrased). It’s simply not true by their actions.

I think in the past four years I have experienced six layoffs and so far survived them all. The reality though is that we always know these layoffs are around the corner, and when the news is leaked (which it always is) people freak out (understandably!). Our last layoff required three+ months of not knowing who would have a job—that’s not going to help our bottom line (but I think is tied to a regulation). 

Though, root cause is not the timeline. It’s the layoff and (I think unintentional) dishonesty that kills me and has me in a bind—I love this company, but my stress can’t handle this company. I have a family to feed. 

Also, leadership is a bit out of touch. In the last layoff they remarked the percentage cut they would receive in bonus, which still resulted in multi million salaries (which was commented on in the chat as it happened, with the receipts… ouch!). That’s not consolation for the person who relies on their check to stay housed and feed their family, especially in this oversaturated market."

Flexible Working Hours:
The company offers flexible working hours, which has been a significant benefit. Employees are allowed to start and finish their workdays at times that suit their personal schedules, as long as they meet project deadlines and attend necessary meetings.

Remote Work Options:
Since the pandemic, Cisco has adopted a hybrid work model. Employees have the option to work from home several days a week, which greatly reduces commuting time and allows for a more comfortable and productive work environment.

Vacation and Time Off:
The company provides generous vacation days and encourages employees to use them. I never felt pressured to skip my vacations, and management genuinely supports taking time off to recharge.

Health and Wellness Programs:
Cisco offers various health and wellness programs, including gym memberships, yoga classes, and mental health resources. These programs are a testament to the company's commitment to the well-being of its employees.

Cisco provides a lot of resources and opportunities to explore what you uniquely bring to your work, lead with your strengths, practice mindfulness, and keep balance and flexibility in your life. It is a place that strives to be welcoming and supportive of diverse communities with a lot of employee resource groups to help. Their benefits are great and receiving 80 hrs per year to volunteer is simply amazing. I hope they don't cut that back.","The PTO is 20 days per year, but you are forced to use 3-4 for those days during the mandatory holiday shutdown period, so the PTO is effectively 16 or 17 days. 
They have had a lot of unannounced layoffs or ""restructuring"" since I joined.
And like any large corporation, a lot of the internal processes and requirements are like navigating a maze to follow. 
It is also very slow to move and coming from an acquisition this was a hard transition. Also, when we were acquired, we thought we would get more resources to help, but that was not the case. 
Despite the ideals for how to be a good leader and make Cisco a great place to work, individual managers may or may not follow, leaving much variability in the working environment on a particular team."

Work/Life Balance is good.","Back to laying off every 6 months. The most likely reason you will get laid off is ""this year's executive"" for your function wants to do things differently. Or your team is marooned in the wrong organization. How did your team get marooned? From last year's executive's re-org. Being re-orged into IT or Operations is a common death sentence and you should begin a 6 month exit plan as soon as it happens.

Leadership couldn't answer a ""How to return to growth?"" question after the most recent layoff. CEO had a ""hope in 6 months"" answer. Services EVP had a word salad. This was a seeded question in a moderated forum. Newly appointed Chief Product Officer is coming from a lackluster division (WebEx) and admitted to knowing nothing about Enterprise Networking.

There's a reason people come to Cisco and never leave, it's a company built by good people.","Do-nothing middle management, obsession with forecasting to the detriment of customer engagement, age bias toward Gen X and above for leadership which is stifling innovation and change. 

Recent influence from Palo Alto Networks refugees and Cisco outsiders are destroying what made Cisco different from peers in the industry - good culture. Three days a week centered on obsessively detailed metrics, overly rigid sales processes that destroy authenticity and creativity, fear-based sales culture around performance. There's also an unspoken but obvious effort to undermine longer term Cisco sellers with mercenary hires from outside the company that have no IT background whatsoever. New external leadership hires are telling partners that ""Cisco salespeople are lazy"". 

New sales leader is toxic and clueless about technology, reads from a script, does not understand what customers expect from a mature technology company like Cisco, and is inundating our sales force with administrative overhead that makes AMs/PSSs feel more like accountants. This is couched in a new mantra around ""creating a unified sales process"", but is bogging down sellers with hours upon hours of onerous training and administrative work."

Software engineer,4.0,"May 11, 2023","Former employee, less than 1 year","Everyone I interacted with was friendly, helpful, and professional. Although management pushed for hybrid working from what was previously full remote, it was a 'come at your own time' culture so long as you met your responsibilities. Break room had a fancy coffee machine, and management would cater lunches once a week. Most days I would come into the office to do any work that needed hands on configuration of our testbed in the lab, grab lunch, then continue to work from home.","Well I was laid off after 6 months so obviously layoffs. The late night or early morning meetings to catch up with the India team was tiresome. An incredible breadth of information you have to have a working knowledge of. Every protocol, the custom OS's and commands on the devices, and how to work with Cisco proprietary systems like SD-WAN. You have to learn the CLI commands before you can move onto GUI since you can't accomplish many things with a GUI alone. Personally, my manager was outright adversarial with me as a junior. I was put under the wing of 3 different people in trying to acclimate to the job, it was highly stressful trying to get up to speed. Few transferable skills: I worked with an python library that was eventually made open source, but there wasn't too much documentation and few employers care about my experience with a library that's solely used to test networks."

Director,3.0,"Feb 23, 2024","Former employee, more than 10 years","Above average compensation.
It used to be the culture.... hopefully it can be recessitated.","Culture is decaying with growing pockets of toxic teams. Leadership that is being promoted have either made a pledge of loyalty to the leadership above or they are a ""yes Sir"" kind of person. So, it has become a norm to see toxic VPs that did not make it to their positions based on merit and see them openly exhibit some of the most outrageously toxic behaviors (condescending, see differing opinions as ""falling out of line"", etc.). This leads to most of the Director level being disempowered and having to balance self preservation with doing the right thing for the business & the employees. The remaining layers of management are each less empowered than the layer above them. This leads to individual contributors that are struggling to contribute because navigating the trickling down toxicity is consuming most of their time and mental cycles. 
The problem is not limited to VP and below. It start with the glaring void of a Head of Engineering in the C-Suite. Each Business Unit Head reports to the CEO - thus making the CEO the one to lead technology direction, prioritizations and the biggest one: getting the BUs to work together to deliver on a platform strategy. That would be great if Chuck was Elon or Jeff B. - but he is not. So, he has outsourced those decisions to be based on C-Suite consensus - the very reason why the C-Suite has resorted to running like the Senate - alliances, lobbying, trading favors, etc. Oh, and the CFO ... he runs the financials like an accountant - I bet Cisco's books have never looked better :-). But top talent is walking to the competition, moral is at an all time low, and innovation (through acquisition, ""Spin In"" , or internal investments) is at a stand still since Kelly left. But I bet those books look good :-). BTW, Splunk does not qualify as ""innovation infusion"". There are plenty of ""innovation"" activities talked about by BU leader turned Chief Strategy Officer (who still cannot get herself to fully perform the CSO role because she has not let go of her BU leader identity - so, she is the CSO but also leads Applications *shake head*). Activities only - no results - no successful monetization. It does not take much to understand why innovation is dead, the culture has turned highly political and toxic, and now business performance is impacted (it's not just due to macroeconomic). It is sad to see such a great company deteriorate at such a rapid pace. It's making it obvious that the #1 Place to Work ranking is a paid PR service. However, I do have to say that out of the entire C-Suite, Fran is the only executive that is delivering results (you may not like or agree with the results or approach but she is delivering). 
What is the CEO succession plan (as Chuck is in semi-retirement mode and focused on building personal legacy/brand vs running a company)?
What is the board thinking & doing??? Fiduciary duty anyone?"

Other Pros: RSUs are good, ESPP is standard, company has a diverse product portfolio that is potentially well-suited for economic challenges, senior management seems okay *I haven't paid too much attention to them* Honestly, I do truly believe that Cisco has the potential to be a great company that is able to attract top talent in Silicon Valley. However, the company needs to reevaluate middle management. Investing in management training is the bare minimum and they're currently are doing that, but the company really needs to do more. For example, promoting individuals based on their leadership qualities and not just their technical knowledge and years of experience. Cultivating a more progressive and open-minded culture could go a long way in improving employee satisfaction and retention.","Disappointed by: dental and vision options, have to pay to use company gym, a lot of teams are starting to require ""return to office"" which is going to hurt the company as they are also trying to downsize their real estate, poor laptop options if you need a non-MacBook. Please take all high ratings and company awards lightly, as Cisco does push it's current employees to skew the results.

At least in the organization I work, many people are here to just coast, so if you want to grow and get experience, you have to be proactive and patient to make the best use of your time.","I worked with some of the worst people. They were arrogant, emotionally immature, overly defensive, and surprisingly incompetent / out of touch - maybe byproducts of the coasting culture? I also worked with people who were highly capable and professional, so it might've been just a bad luck. Heavy layers of professional middle managers. Constant restructuring (aka layoff) ordered by the leadership who doesn't understand what's happening in the field and things are generally messy because of that.

We have had many customers leave Cisco products for Palo Alto or other vendors simply because our products are garbage now, and the TAC support is atrocious.

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Nov 30, 2023","Former employee, more than 3 years","Definitely one of the best companies to work for in terms of work life balance. Atleast it’s true in terms of the team I worked for in Bangalore. 
Was extremely lucky to have had amazing managers.","Work was ok initially as a young engineer I got to learn a lot, but as you grow in your career as an SDE your opportunities to learn kinda reduces as you have a lot of senior folk around and you might not end up getting your due recognition and opportunities.

Promotions are difficult as you grow can be said the same for other companies.

Salary hikes are mediocre reasons being budget constraints but company has the budget to spend billions to buy Splunk

Opportunities to switch to a team in US usually gets shot down by pathetic Executives in the US and India. Even if the other team really likes you and wants you there. Basically favourites of those people might get a chance in the future if an opportunity presents itself.

Overall salary compared to other major companies in the market it’s below the market average. I’ve seen smaller and bigger companies who were willing to offer close to 40LPA for the same role.

Lots of reorgs and uncertainty, priorities keep changing and most recently in our team one person had to do 2-3 people’s work would have been valuable if the work was something cutting edge but it basic UI work and some simple backend services to setup simple API routes to serve content to the UI. Definitely got bored and burnt out quite fast."

This is awesome! The CEO Chuck Robbins and the ETL team is simply amazing and they listen An over all autonomy of work is practiced Great work like balance and it is encouraged if you happen to be a workaholic. Overall comradery still exists in Cisco, Cisconians actually care for each other.","The work can sometimes have longer time lines due to processes being in place and it may seem like a slow moving ship sometimes, at the same time processes mean consistency and hassle free audits in the larger scheme of things.

I mean it. benefits, business travel quality, etc. -Great bonding & relationship with fellow peers. -Sales performers are rewarded and recognized. A very satisfying feeling that money cannot buy. (sales champions, chairmans club ,etc) -Great products, strong channel & partner ecosystem. -Partners, customers respect the brand. Makes the selling fun, challenging and a bit easy. -Account manager have power, authority and accountability. -Entire org will come forward to win a deal for and with you. -Fast, less bureaucratic, focus on execution and speed.","-The experience is not uniform and will vary from team to team, manager to manager. While I was fortunate to have amazing managers, peers, I did see certain segments /managers were toxic, career derailing for a few of my friends. Situation can get political/diplomatic. -unrealistic sales number pressure. -you need a bit of luck -commit pressure is unreal at time. (you will love it or hate it) -not every product sells. For eg servers, webex, security sales is tough. So if you are getting in these product sales role - do your research. -The IT hardware is getting commoditized with transformation of SAAS, cloud. Has lots a bit of its charm in recent years. -Cloud, SAAS, Security is paying better these days. (2023). -Career movement / horizontally/ globally is limited. -work life balance very bad if you are in India. I have spend 70% of my weekends working (no one asks, but expects). Something that flows from top, especially in India. Not sure if that has changed since 2022.
-No career/skip manager discussions for professional growth. 

I left Cisco in 2022 as I didn't see any guidance on career growth, plan. I was getting bored. I went ahead for an interview outside to merely assess my market value and get some insights outside of Cisco world. I was shocked at the industry comp being offered. (mind you, i never asked for a single raise. I just believed in Cisco).  Having said, Cisco has been wonderful in so many ways for me. I'll always be grateful and Cisco will always hold a special place. There is never a dull moment and it will prepare you for your future.  I was lucky to be a Cisco."

Network consulting engineer,2.0,"Sep 13, 2023","Current employee, more than 8 years","I guess you could say 401k match is comparable to other competitors. Health care options - HMO / PPO with excellent benefits (like low co-pay, etc.) ESPP are a good benefit you should take advantage of. Work from home option is a perk. There are a lot of excellent engineers with a breadth of knowledge that you can reach out to for assistance. Most are willing to help and are friendly. People are smart here. For the most part. There are bonuses as well. Paid bi-annually. Amount is based on your grade / company performance / personal performance.","Let's list them: 1- middle managers are more or less cheerleaders. Esp people managers. They are also bogged down in a lot of busy meetings. So, you get ignored, for the most part. Not because of you. They are too busy. In busy meetings. Which are stacked. 2 - career stagnation. you will not move ANYWHERE unless you apply internally, which takes, what? 15 to 25 internal interviews? this is pointless and discouraging. 3 - constant layoffs. not always based on performance. in fact, the reason is never revealed to you. So no one knows why / how they were targeted. And its usually annually. right before X-Mas holidays. NICE. Cisco LOVES RIFs. And the funny thing is, they encourage you to apply internally. As if its that easy. See above. 4 - stock price is stagnant and not going anywhere. And hasn't gone anywhere for a lot of years. Well, maybe it trickled up by a few dollars per share. So those RSU benefits I listed above? You won't get rich, folks. 5 - Pointless numerous meetings with people managers, bi-weekly, 1:1. Expecting us to ""grow, grow, grow."" God forbid you don't look busy on your timesheets for your billing hours. They also expect you to know the management chain. When you are near the bottom. OKAY. Sure, I will memorize the names and roles of those 6 layers up, and talk candidly about their visions and what they are seeking. 6 - Mgmt - If you have a toxic manager, you will have a miserable experience. Because this company is stagnant. So you are stuck on the team unless you apply internally. And of course, pass those 25 interviews. Which can take a year and a half. 7 - Upper Mgmt - Don't ever reach out directly to them unless you want to get burnt. They expect you to reach out to their assistant directly. Assuming they have an assistant. They can't / won't be bothered. 8 - Internal technical training - yes they have it. And its not the best. Try 3rd party vendors which are far superior, like INE. 9 - Salary increase. Doesn't exist. And if it does, its basically nothing. Better to simply quit and come back as a different grade. Also salaries are on lower end of the spectrum in a comparable role at a competitor. Salaries depend quite a bit on your geographic region as well."

Manager (research lead),3.0,"Nov 30, 2022","Former employee, more than 3 years",Remote work 100% in some roles/business units. Bonuses around 10-15%. Extreme flexibility with location -- my department didn't care if people wanted to relocate (to other countries even!). Decent work/life balance.,"Remote culture means it's hard to build connections. Lack of leadership vision. Every quarter it was all about VP shuffling. Very hard to get promoted, very hard to get salary lift. I was there for 3 years before they offered me equity (a very paltry 5-figure amount to be paid over 4 years). Salary is nowhere near FAANG equivalent. 2x year layoffs. US health insurance was very Cali-focused, so if you're trying to use it or live outside of California, be prepared for $$$ visits and prescriptions. There isn't a lot of prestige to the Cisco name anymore (despite what they tell you internally). Cisco bungled the WebEx opportunity during the pandemic. If you are still early and energetic in your career, get what you can out of the experience in a year or two, and plan to leave. For those of you mid-late career, this could be a good place to 'rest and vest' if you can survive the layoff seasons."

Retirement Plans: Many companies offer retirement plans such as 401(k) or pension plans. Cisco's retirement plan may include matching contributions to the employee's savings. Life Insurance: Cisco may offer life insurance benefits that provide financial support to the employee's beneficiaries in the event of their death.","Cost: While employee benefits are designed to be a benefit to the employee, some benefits can be expensive. Employees may have to pay a portion of the cost of their benefits package, which can be a financial burden. Limited Coverage: Not all benefits packages offer comprehensive coverage. Some benefits may have exclusions or limitations that could limit the employee's access to the care they need. Inflexibility: Some benefits packages may not be flexible enough to meet the needs of all employees.

Its not personal. Comp Plan changes too much but we are evolving as a Company so it is expected, if you don't like change don't come here. Note this con can be for any job. My job has only been as good as the accounts I support and my team. Past 2 years I have had decent accounts, a great support team and great manager.

At the same time product management is given complete decision authority on features. 3) Slightly lower pay than the leading companies in Big Tech. 4) Random waves of layoffs that often impact great people, while the not-so-great people remain. Random waves of layoffs have been happening since 2014. Then they try to rehire. 5) 360 reviews are non-existent. If you have a problem with your manager, there is nobody to talk to on a regular basis. 6) Company is emotional and impulsive when it comes to 'disruptive' technologies. Instead of working internally on trying to develop products and technologies for new markets, the company prefers to acquire start-ups with great pitch books. Only to realize a couple of years later that it was too good to be true. Please perform due diligence.
7) In some JDM activities, brazen dishonesty is tolerated by the company from their counterparty. In other words, when a JDM partner substitutes its A-team for its F-team, Cisco turns a blind eye to it and does not demand accountability. As a result, Cisco ends up doing the work internally while pretending that the JDM did it."

Cisco tac engineer,4.0,"Feb 16, 2023","Former employee, more than 3 years","Great work culture and managers. Lot of projects (work) is available and people are available to help everywhere. The team culture in general is great across all teams. If you have to do anything with networks and networks is your long term career goal then there is absolutely no better place than Cisco. There is a LOT of training available , high end labs with tons of devices and opportunities to do so many industry level certificates and all this is free of cost.","At the end of the day it is a network support role after all. Even if you might take up a lot of automation python projects but you have to take care of your cases/.backlog. You might feel burnt out in few high severity cases as well (very similar to what software devs face when their 'feature' is about to 'go live') but that gets easier with time and experience. The nature of the job can be viewed in 2 ways : Positive : You are Sherlock Holmes who has to investigate and use your skills on multiple cases. Negative : Your work basically starts when things are going wrong. So you are almost always. dealing with a mental 'timer' as they are people waiting for you to provide solutions or answers and most of the times it is not easy. Multiple logs , timestamps, data correlation and since you are not the one who has written the code. Except few rare days mostly you will have a lot of emails to write and multiple logs to check. Salary growth can be slow ( as far as I am aware 10-18% is standard) however if your communication with management is positive and your manager assures you then it can be worth the wait. Exponential increment after a span of 2-3 years is common I have heard. This will vary a lot based on an individual's exp and work they have put in so not really a con. Lot of mandatory trainings :-P"

We do leadership training every year and are provided with industry training like agile principles, multi-cloud, troubleshooting, design thinking, customer service, and security. Sr management tries to communicate well, giving leaders a heads up, then letting everyone quickly know. We also love the inclusion of all people and how we celebrate people and customs from all parts of the world! Even our Russian employees were looked after without embracing what their country was doing. It was just amazing to watch how we cared for each other, as well as for people in Ukraine and our people helping others, especially in Poland.","Too many directives and micromanagement from above instead of letting Directors and Sr Managers lead and manage their budgets. For example, many still need SVP approval to travel. Layoffs are part of the company culture that is used even in the good times. People are brainwashed into thinking it is OK to treat people this way and they go along with it as they have no idea how it is to be in someone's shoes that were laid off. It is now even called a ""Workforce Transition Options"" as that sounds better than ""layoff"", and they really have no good options."

The additional stress and attempt to normalize the fear of losing your job constantly.. NO THANK YOU. Also huge RTP presence means lots of conservative, christian republicans. Lots of work needed in the D&I space. No formal review, no chance of promotion. People are treated as replaceable resources. 3 managers in 2 years. Didnt see a single team mate promoted in 3 years, even people that had been there 6+ years. Employees have Stockholm syndrome, “feel so lucky they survived the last LR”. The pay is horrrrible for the bay area and they do not give annual increases.. period. If youre lucky youll get a promotion every 5 years. If you are able to keep the same manager for more than 8 months. How this place makes it to the “best places to work” list..... they're clearly bribing someone."

Application operation,2.0,"Dec 29, 2022","Former employee, more than 8 years","- High caliber employees with high caliber results delivered - Great learning and development opportunities at all levels provided by Cisco - Great people that generally care about one another depending upon the department - Personally progressed several levels within my career, as a woman, with generally good support and coaching from leadership - Cisco tries to take care of their employees even in the hardest times such as redundancies - Work life balance could be good if you are in a supportive department allowing it","- Over the years as an acquisition of Cisco, they massively struggled with what to do with the AppD business. This had a major impact on innovation, strategy, and stable leadership of the AppD business. - Over the past year, Cisco is heavily focused on further integration of the AppD business creating fear-based dynamics of employees concerned about their job, pushiness when it comes to strategy moves, lack of care about impact to AppD functions and capacity drain on employees. - No psychological safety within the business at present - Employees that have been within the AppD business for years are expendable to Cisco; All executive leadership have exited and they are bringing in ""Cisco people"" to take over. - Some direction now in strategy, but who knows how long that will last as the trend as been to move in a certain direction and then it doesn't work out. As a hardware company, Cisco is struggling with what to do with AppD from a strategy perspective. - Work/life balance is a struggle in the Operations functions as Cisco tightens their purse strings but keeps dumping loads of work/expectations on an already lean team - Sales culture is very stressed due to all the extra burden being placed on them from an admin and process-oriented perspective. In addition, Enablement of Sales teams is a mess and creates confusion for Sales more than sets them up for success. - Extremely hard to get pay increases within teams for high performers. Wages are based on Cisco banding as a hardware company and Software companies in the market are offering significantly higher wages for the same roles. - Once Cisco came in to take over in the last year, they stopped listening to the advice of most tenured team members within AppD who knew the AppD business best. They made decisions without thinking of the impact for those ""on the ground"" doing the work. - New product launches going out without being fully operationalized. Rushed to market due to being behind and needing to catch up. Creating impact to Sales and potentially customer experience."

It's a two-edged sword, but having the option to take a WebEx from home, Starbucks, airports, the beach, or in the office ... permits a level of versatility -- and fully acceptable by colleagues and management -- that would be hard to repeat elsewhere.  It's part of the culture.  The flipside is that work more easily creeps into your personal space and follows you on vacation if you're not careful.  Another consequence is that Cisco offices can feel like ghost towns.

Cisco has an immensely successful and rich portfolio and is well-positioned for the future.  But ... for the past few years, it has felt like Cisco is constantly trying to turn a corner ... and never quite making it.","The biggest con nowadays is that Cisco is trying vigorously to grow income faster than revenue.  This translates to what seems like a never ending round of budget cuts and divestment.  Workforce reductions are becoming more common than pay raises and the value proposition to working here is becoming harder to defend.

Consulting systems engineer,4.0,"Dec 11, 2015","Current employee, more than 8 years","Cisco is a fun place to work, at least if you're in the sales part of the business. You can usually work from home and take flexible hours provided you're serving your customers well.

Career options are great, you can move around the business relatively easily. Opportunities to move to different countries are frequent and often encouraged.

Lots of opportunities to do side projects and define your own activities. Very little 'micro-managing'.

Rewards outside of base pay are encouraged and easy to distribute, creating a good culture with positive feedback.","No inflationary payrises. Very difficult to get promotions without being a skilled political operative. Managers powerless to help employees in this area as they don't control any budget. Everything goes through a big HR machine. Everything and everyone is a number and cost to be reduced.

Managers are usually looking upwards focussed on their own careers, not paying attention to their employees. Can go months without a performance review or any guidance as to your own career. Promotions, payrises etc all shrouded in secrecy.

Leavers usually not replaced, or replaced slowly. Being 5 heads down is common and workload thrown to employees without any consultation or apology. This in turn affects sales commission.

Technical strategy is weak in areas due to massive in-fightning between business units. Huge egos run parts of the business. Fear is a frequently used motivational tool."

The early days were the best when you actually worked as part of a team. I learned a lot and enjoyed the work/life balance. The continuous training available was always top-notch. If you want to find someplace to hide and retire, there are plenty of dark holes in Cisco to do it.","Too much turnover! Senior people are put in positions they should not hold and this includes the majority of management. If you are not in your director's inner circle then you may as well pack your bags. To get into the inner circle you just have to play the game, kiss the right behinds, and squawk a lot. You don't actually have to work, you just have to be a puppet. If you dance enough little monkey, they may toss you a shilling. The ""People Deal"" and ""Stack Rank"" are horrendous and just created a cutthroat mentality, absolutely destroying teams.

It has gone from being the most rewarding and enjoyable job to an unhealthy call center environment. The VP decided to fix something that was not broken and make everyone work out of the RTP office instead of hiring real raw talent. The director rules by fear and walks the floor to make sure people don't leave before exactly 5pm on a Friday afternoon (this job is requires long hours and they don't allow you to put in overtime, mind you), and you have little or no support from operations. Half of my peers were either in therapy or needed it, and they were always so terrified to come in every day.

Anonymous employee,4.0,"Dec 19, 2008",Current employee,"I like the flexibility of my job and the diversity of cisco's workforce. I have good opportunities to work on a wide range of interesting projects with people all around the globe.

I'm very grateful and proud to work at Cisco. In the current economic downturn, I believe Sr Management is working hard to avoid layoffs (by cutting contingent workforce and expenses first--who knows what the future will bring?). I also think they're being open and transparent about it and are generally doing the right things.

The hours and work locations are flexible; I am able to work from home often.","The lack of coordination across projects is appalling. It seems like I work in a giant crowd of project managers who do nothing but run around in circles looking for projects to manage. There are waaaay too many 'boards and committees,' the function of which is mainly interfering and delaying projects. People at the middle-management layers are simply not incented to work together, despite all the talk about collaboration on the part of Sr. 

Management. As such, political skills pass for leadership and the people who have the best political skills get promoted. The political realities often ignore development realities, which leads to a scramble of ass-covering.

The collaboration technologies are over-hyped. While telepresence is good for demos and meetings where people just talk to each other and show presentations, the lack of interactive whiteboarding and 'working' collaboration technologies cripples my ability to do 'real work' with my colleagues across the globe.

Product development processes are also crippled; there's either no process at all or people use process as a tool for delay and obfuscation. This is the bureaucracy at Cisco."
Software engineer iv,3.0,"Jun 18, 2010",Current employee,"great brains to work with.
Very flexible working hours. Nobody will even care whether you are even coming to the office a day. You can use the WFH lavishly. Overall a great work culture anybody can dream of.","Salary is not up to the market levels, its understandable for a company like cisco having a huge headcount. But the problem here is that when they decides to give increments, they  decides to give more % hike to the guys whos sitting in the upper level or whoever is earning more. Overall all the scenario is rich becomes richer. 

One more bad thing is the hardened processes. Doesn't matter whether you are doing a small silly task or not the number of processes you have to do consumes way more time than it takes for actual tasks itself. This repeated unwanted bureaucracy driven processes will make you terribly bored and give you headache and dizziness every single day.

I doubt the india team still does have a proper direction for their growth, everyone still relies on the big SJ team and folks here are somewhat getting considered as a second grade people. whenever a good work comes in to thewider  team, its gone to the SJ. And you gets bored keepon doing the same old maintenance work. Just to make your mouths shut, once in a blue moon day you get some crap new stuff. after that again you do the same thing."

2) Size of the site: it's a pretty big site (1600+ employees) with a quite low average age: people in Cisco Krakow are fun!","1) Middle management in Cisco Krakow is really mediocre, and definitely not diverse. Most managers are Poles and while there's this appearance of inclusion and diversity within the company, at the end of the day you'll see locals (or Ukranians, the second biggest community) progressing in their career,  getting promotions, recognitions, and so on... while it happens way too rarely for internationals (in proportion with the number of people, of course).

2) Being a low cost center in a saturated market like Krakow, the quality of talent Cisco manages to get there is not so high.

3) No meritocracy AT ALL.

4) No metrics/KPI / good place for early retirement: you will find lots of people in who just put in a few hours of work per day, get to work at 10:00, leave at 15:000, go for groceries in the meantime... and nobody cares, because there is no way whatsoever to measure anybody's performance (beside in a very few roles). Management doesn't even notice it.

5) Other departments within Cisco, in the regions, do not have a high respect for centralized low cost centers."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 15, 2017",Former employee,This company has a big name in tech so it is a resume builder for sure regardless of your personal experience within the company.,"If you are young in your career Cisco can be a nightmare. Managers have absolutely no idea what you do from day to day and seem to care little about that. You can go months without talking to your manager if you want. Managers couldn't care less about your professional development. Having sync up calls with your manager to discuss development is literally a joke because they will help you with nothing. Cisco is losing talent fast and a big reason is because they pay poor, the company is too bureaucratic  for career growth, and management is completely lousy. In my four years at Cisco I've had 5 or 6 managers and I can only say that one of them was a good/great one. Oh and I almost forgot. If you are early in your career forget about proper training. Cisco is absolutely horrendous and training new talent for the work force. This is literally a sink or swim company. You come in on your first day after a couple years out of college and your manager is looking at you to close million dollar deals with no proper product, role, or field training. They'll just say figure it out or browse the companies 70k people to find someone who can give you advice. They don't even assign you a mentor. The ability for people to work from home has turned the office to a ghost town so if you enjoy he presence of other human being you better forget about it here."

I have sent mails to VP's and even the President of the company and have always been treated with respect and deference.  That is very telling on what a true open door policy looks like.

I think the greatest support for Cisco statistically is that people who work here don't leave.  I'm in a high level consulting position and get constant job offers, but no other companies create as compelling and challenging of a work environment as Cisco has to offer.

Absolute great company to work for, and has my highest recommendation from a 15 year industry vet who has worked for top companies around the world including Microsoft.","Typical Company cons that can all be summed up by ""slow moving"".

"Manager, product marketing",3.0,"Jun 25, 2008",Current employee,The level of talent at Cisco is generally quite high and a cut above other companies. The compensation package is generally solid though raises have not kept up with the rest of the valley and Cisco is no longer significantly better than other companies. The sheer size of Cisco allows one to move into other areas of interest and find new opportunities if they desire to branch out.,"Hours are long and work loads high. If you make an effort to take time off management will be supportive in my experience but they will not go out of their way to encourage work life balance. The company will suck you dry if you let it. Competition for advancement is very keen, especially at the grade 11/12 level and politics will often play a very significant role since there will almost always be several qualified people. Career development is non-existent even for those who have been labeled ""high potential"".

The management at the Director and Sr. Director level is the weakest in the company and contains a significant number of political infighters and deadwood. This creates management paralysis and limits growth opportunities for others."
Hardware engineer iv,3.0,"Mar 23, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco is a great place for work/life balance - I would high recommend Cisco for working moms. There is the flexibility of working from home if need be - best thing is people do not abuse that system. You have access to a wealth of informations - technical talks, seminars, classes to enhance technical knowledge. There are also leadership classes to hone leadership skills. Extensive use of IT tools and Web made all the processes online and very seamless. I personally believe the salary, compensation and benefits are at par with the valley companies. Overall, its a great place to have fun and work at the same time.","One of the biggest complaint I have against Cisco is it's career development plan & implementation for the employees. The ePM every year talks about the growth and career plan - but in reality the managment is always driven by very near term goals and not long term vision. As a result all the career development plans of individual contributors do not go anywhere - again next year the ePM comes and the story repeats. There is not much functional rotation as well - its very hard to convince Level1/2 manager why I would want to move from his/her group and go to another group to do something else - instead of encouraging the individual's passion to do something of his/her interest in another group, the manager is worried about shrinking empire if an employee is lost to another group."

Still the premier tech name out there, at least when it comes to hardware and networking.","Very passive aggressive culture. Can be a difficult place for people who prefer directness. People rarely actually say no to anything and so you waste time doing things that never had a chance to gain full support, and you need to herd cats across multiple functions (this is the classical functional siloed company) to get anything done (this ties to the plus that it is a very collaborative culture - you have to work with others to get anything done). Support functions are awful, especially HR. Seriously, this is the worst HR function in the history of business. If you want to see what a company is like that operates on non-sensical policies, and where you can't do something logical because it is against policy, welcome to Cisco. Especially with regards to HR. WPR writes reports on how much space we're using and how much energy we've saved because we decided to get rid of the coffee machine. Seriously, why do we have people whose job includes spending time doing this??!??!?"
Software engineer iv,3.0,"Sep 5, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years","Some things like pay for performance in certain BUs is true (the one I worked at least). Your bonus is a direct reflection of whether you go extra mile (or) stay 10-5. For a large company they have fantastic CAP(monetary appreciation or gift card) award programs for folks who go above and beyond (which I don't see with most employers) , well defined RSU structure and a much better than average 401k plan. You can work from anywhere as long as you get the work done your manager does not care if you don't show up at 9:00AM. Fantastic team mates and managers!.","Your base salary is low. Lately there has been lot of chopping and churning of work force non-stop. Some mandatory people movements across business units may or may not be liked by you but you have to live with it. Very difficult to move across to other BUs where interesting work is done, often they give huge weight to ""current experience"" - even for a very good performer if you don't have the exact skill match they're not ready to train you and in an effect you become stale and lazy over time because the desire to move around (which can be a big motivator to stay around) gets killed. Huge bias towards work done in by spin-ins. Some times they're deliberate they don't want your product/BU to thrive irrespective of you meeting H/W release deadlines."

Software engineer ii,4.0,"Oct 2, 2008",Current employee,"I was hired by Cisco choice program, in which new hires can choose their teams based on how they like to work or who to work for. Since most teams need more people, managers squeeze their brains to attract the new hires into their team. Before the new hires choose their teams, they are exposed to most information about projects and benefits or drawbacks of each team which is tipped by managers, who pamper the new hires badly (I thought I'm the king of cisco during the period - once I chose my team, my heyday was over..). This is an example of cisco how this company tries to lay out best environment for their employees.","The largest problem in cisco is its size. It is a big guy, which means its decision making process is very slow. Officially my reporting structure is not that complicated; manager, general manager, director, and VP (there are more, but in my position, I doubt that I can see anyone of them).

Managers are generally open minded and encourage asking tough questions and challenging the status quo. Industry Leader. Still a growth company.  Compensation and benefits are excellent. For instance, the medical and dental package is 2nd to none and much better than most other comparable companies.  “If you are uncomfortable with change, Cisco might not be the place for you. There are significant leadership and strategy changes as we adapt to different markets. Many projects we work on are started and stopped haphazardly by product marketing or senior leadership.","“- Many things in the new hire process are unorganized for new employees. I particularly dislike the 2+ week overhead trying to get initial items setup.
- Expectations for corporate culture may be put on badges, but I am not feeling the type of camaraderie that I had, nor the new employee immersing expectations that occurred for my last job with ""Big Chip Inc"". It's starting to feel like more people are there putting in their 9 - 5 instead of being there because they enjoy their work more. Then again I am biased and so is my viewpoint of being a Software Engineer.”"
Technical marketing engineer,3.0,"Jul 10, 2013","Former employee, more than 10 years","You would think that at a company that owns more than 70% marketshare would be frought with ego and islands.  This might be true as you start moving up the food chain, however at the individual contributor level - there is a great deal of comraderie as everyone feels like a ""little fish"" in a big pond - and even the most veteran employees - still would collaborate.  There is a great sense of trust.  The culture is extremely collaborative with an idea that we are all virtually on the same team (because eventually you probably will be.)  A LOT of cross-teaming and matrix ran projects across the board.  I might be subjective because I had the fortune of working out of the bay area - I know that Cisco employees that were not close to corporate had less than nice things and feelings about it.","The only constant is change.  In over 10 years, I had over 10 managers without really having to change teams very much.  There seems to be a lot of flexibility within the org structure that ends up with a lot of revisions to applications, tools, processes, and structure.  

Talk about frugal!!! No free sodas anymore- and the cafeteria prices are higher than some of the restaurants that are within walking distance of campus.  There are basically no more perks left at Cisco other than the chance to use a macbook air as your standard pc and that somewhere someone back in engineering has probably created an ""app for that"" if you can't find what you're looking for on the intranet."

Amazing benefits including a full week of paid leave for charity volunteering. Love how much the company gives back to society.,"Very rare to get a salary increase, so be sure you're OK with the salary you accept. Lots of churn in mid-management, I've had 13 managers in seven years. Tough to get your ideas heard, unless you're politically minded. Since the company is so large, there are a lot of slackers who coast along just under the radar, which can be de-motivating. Very engineering driven with design, and user experience, as an afterthought. There is also no clear career path for designers. Design is not handled in a traditional manner, so collaborating with fellow designers is rare- instead you're assigned a product and become silo'ed in it."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 6, 2016","Former employee, more than 10 years","- The people are incredibly sharp and supportive (with a few exceptions). 
- Pockets of leadership are outstanding. 
- The benefits are second to none. Good restricted stock options, 401K, ESPP.
- Teleworking option - allows for better work / life balance (sort of - see below)","- ENDLESS meetings. Back-to-back-to-back...Think 8 solid hours starting at 6 AM. 
- It's great that so many of the employees have the flexibility to be remote. However, I noticed that it has meant many employees are dis-engaged, going thru the motions. 
- Count on the annual re-org happening -- which means annual layoffs
- I personally have worked at Cisco for more than 15 years and got let go. Cisco may say they want you to retire there, which I was convinced I would...I was so loyal to that company, then suddenly got let go. It was pretty brutal to say the least. I essentially got kicked out of the family.  
- There's ""juniorization"" of the workforce going on here. They are trying to bring down the average age so if you are 23, good for you. If you are 38 or above, chances are it will be difficult for you to make your case. Millennials seem to hold a lot of importance at this company. Experience is no longer prime currency
- Changes going on in leadership and the way work gets done is highly, highly distracting. 
- Employee morale is extremely low"
Virtual customer success manager,5.0,"Jun 4, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year","I love working here and the support you get from all levels of management can't be beat. People think sometimes that when you work for a large company like Cisco, you'll somehow get overlooked. But I can tell you that's not the case. You get to work with the smartest people in the industry who truly believe in educating and enabling their employees. Everyday, I feel like I've made an impact, and that my value is being recognized. I advocate everyday for my friends to work here because it is absolutely the best place to be. Customer Success is taking the industry by storm right now, and there is not a better company to be working with.  Cisco has always been a thought leader, and they recognize how critical Customer Success is for our customers. I can't wait to see how this group grows and transforms within the coming months. It's one of the most rewarding careers being able to work so closely with customers to truly understand their business, and how we can help them reach their business outcomes. If you want to learn, grow and be surrounded by passionate, motivated people - this is where you'll find them!","It's a newer team, so naturally there are still some things they are trying to work out in terms of what technology we align to and other little nuances... but it doesn't take away from the value you deliver as a CSM or the overall experience of working there.  It's more of a growing pain than a con! :)"

Program manager,4.0,"Jun 13, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco strongly enables their employees even at the individual contributor level.  If you have good ideas and the drive to enable them, you can do well.

Of course, as with any large company, alot depends on your group and your direct manager.  However, mobility is generally encouraged from group to group and the tools are there for you to take advantage of it.  

Other reasons to work at Cisco are the ability to be involved with cutting edge technology and processes.  Cisco strives to be ahead of the curve both in terms of the products and the way we work.  

There are many great minds at work at Cisco and it energizes you to be around them each day.","The bell curve is enforced for ratings/rankings and it does not always lead to good results for Cisco or the employee.

The ratings and rankings system can be unfair and hold people back who should be promoted.  There is not a lot of consistency from group to group and if you're stuck in a group where there are a lot of high performers, you can be unfairly penalized.  

As the company gets older, there can be a tendency to fall back on tried and true ways rather than innovating.  Management says they want to encourage new ways of working but if it impacts their bottom line or they are afraid setbacks will reflect poorly on them, that can stand in the way of change."
Marketing communications manager,5.0,"Jan 27, 2019","Current employee, less than 1 year","While Cisco is a huge and global company, you have a sense of belonging to something bigger than yourself. There’s ways to get involved to navigate the vastness, for example tuning into our company all hands meeting, also known as the Cisco Beat. This is an opportunity to hear firsthand our leadership’s top of mind and where Cisco is focused as a company. Another way to get involved is by joining an Employee Resource Organization (ERO), such as Early Career Network or Connected Women. These employee organizations are communities that help you grow personally and professionally by connecting you with others who share similar interests and come from similar backgrounds. It is a chance to experience the wonderful diversity that exists within Cisco . Lastly, the flexibility that Cisco has is unmatched. For example, just this past Thanksgiving Holiday I fell ill and not well enough to go into the office. Luckily, with our flexible working policies and my agreement with my manager, I was able to work the entire week from home – no missed meetings!","Aforementioned, Cisco is a large company where success is emphasized by maintaining one’s own personal network and development. You have your roles and responsibilities but an added layer of continuous self-improvement through development courses and scoping careers on Cisco’s career site that might fit with your skillset. In other words, any role at Cisco won’t be an 8am-5pm Monday-Friday set-schedule job – but it will be as good as you make it!"
Cisco tac engineer,4.0,"Jan 24, 2022","Current employee, more than 1 year","Company Culture is amazing, And I really mean it. I planned to join cisco for a year or two max before leaving, out of college. But the Culture has made me love this place. Especially in TAC, which operates at its own level in most things.

So much to learn, the amount of knowledge is insane, the regular Technical Leaders at Cisco has would be equivalent, to Principle Engineers in most Companies. You never stop learning, every one and anyone you can ping, sync up and learn from.","Salary, 
One of the biggest down side, I see is the inflated salaries being offered for roles similar if not, ever more basic then what we do everyday in TAC. 
Being a global company, the company is able to acquire talent and resources at anywhere and bring them up. Which has shrunk the teams in US, by what seems to be by design of Execs. To run barely breathing teams in US.

In my role I was often able to work from home without recrimination, as were most people.  Generally really liked the people, but in a company that large there are bound to be some jerks.","To this day it boggles my mind how poorly managed the company as a whole is.  They have layoffs every year and never seem to figure out that its because they have poor talent management.  All too often highly skilled technical people are promoted into leadership positions , and they have no idea what they are doing and the team suffers.  there is also no consideration for compensation given to employees for their experience.  If you get hired this year at a set salary, it does not have a cost of living increase.  Next year an identical person could be hired who would make more than you, even though they have less experience.  This is one of the major causes of employee attrition.  I can really only speak for IT but Mid-level management (director level) is just plain bad.  By every definition of the term, just poor leadership."

There is a renewed focus on it's greatest asset-- the people, and it really shows in how the company fosters a team atmosphere, continual training/learning opportunities, and dozens of employee-focused activities, benefits, perks, etc etc etc.  I left Cisco for a period of time, and after experiencing several other companies, how they treat employees, the culture differences, I can honestly say that Cisco is by far the best company I have ever worked for. It is fast paced, and if you are not a ""high performer"" it can be a challenge, because the people here are incredibly intelligent and competitive... just dive right in and learn to swim!","The fast paced nature of the business can be overwhelming sometimes, but if you embrace it and work smart, with continual learning built into your career plan, then the sky is the limit. Life is about choices, and because of the collaborative, ""always on"" nature of the network, you must learn to unplug from work to keep your life in balance--- otherwise you start ""living to work"" instead of ""working to live"".  You have to manage YOUR career and calendar, otherwise the aggressive, success-driven nature of Cisco will ""eat you for lunch""."

We also have five days paid time off each year (in addition to our regular vacation time)  to serve our communities through the charity of our choice.  In my experience there is very little micro-management, the people are great to work with, and it is a very diverse work culture.

The good thing is that if you ever get bored with a certain role, you can always switch to a new team. That makes work always challenging, and when it's challenging, it's interesting. The downside is that most of the work going on is on proprietary technologies, (in may area atleast) so it may not be helpful when switching companies.","It's a big company so you may get lost. I'm ambitious, and in such a big company, it's not easy to get to the top. 
It's also, frankly, boring. Not because of the work, but because of the environment. They have ancient drab grey cubicles, which is just off-putting to a lot of millennials in the tech industry who are used to interesting office spaces, creative and challenging environments, and good food.
Lastly, there need to be more promotions and rewards. It's common to see people leaving even though they like their job, simply because if they didn't they wouldn't progress in their career. There are slackers, and there are over-acheivers, and there needs to be a better mechanism to identify them."

Great work experience.","While the culture is improving, it still has many challenges.  Way too many people that are in leadership positions that shouldn't be. They think that bullying their employees is fine as long as they can effectively suck up to senior management.   Lots of implicit bias in the organization, and women definitely suffer from the classic double-bind:  if you are decisive you aren't likable, and it stalls your growth.   Continual churn of executives creates whiplash in employees, as a new executives come in with new plans, throw the baby out with the bath water, and then move on when they figure out there ideas aren't so great after all.

It's important to speak with current or recent employees connected to the hiring department to make sure you fully understand what you're getting into.   And I'm sure Cisco isn't unique in that they don't always provide enough budget to adequately fund certain expansion initiatives. The expected results are made crystal clear, but enough resources to achieve it may not be provided.

Being a part of a small group makes it feel homey and easy to settle into. Being a remote office, and also an integral part of the security effort, we are shielded from the greater movements within Cisco with respect to business reorganizations, workforce reductions, etc.

It's a blank canvas, if you would like to achieve something special here, it is possible. Of course, if you would like to slowly wilt here, that is sadly also possible.

On the corporate side of things, l feel that upper management did the right thing by calling a preemptive layoff in 2013. They saw the writing on the wall and didn't hesitate, although, they could have reorged better; cutting 4000 and then immediately hiring 500 for new disruptive businesses is an incredible waste of talent and acquisition dollars.

We're a buzzword factory!","At a remote site, small-office politics reign. 

Career advancement is almost non-existent. There are no career paths/development plans to speak of.  Cronyism runs rampant during the stagnant periods, which is to say, most of the time. Salaries are less than you would find on the east coast; not at all comparable to the left coast. Bonuses are necessary to make the compensation acceptable, but each year it's a crapshoot whether you will get them or not. Employees will advance faster by leaving the company and returning later."
Service operations manager,4.0,"Jun 9, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","Industry leader for 20+ years, Cisco manages to re-invent itself during market transitions, leaving competitors in the dust. Plenty of challenging work, you're surrounded by strong talent willing to collaborate in cross-functional projects to achieve goals. The complete compensation package & benefits seem better than industry average. Cisco manages finances as I do: Being frugal and debt free. The company has an enormous amount of cash available to survive tough times and take advantage of acquisition opportunities.","More political and more turf wars than it used to be. Still a good place compared to other companies though. No job security, more layoffs than similar companies - that's the price you pay for being a large company that must move fast through market transitions.

The campus is huge and there are lots of jobs available. The transportation shuttle between buildings is a great gas-saver. Liked being able to telecommute and have a flexible work schedule. Enjoyed attending the all hands meetings hosted by John Chambers, he is a good speaker and the sessions were entertaining and informative. Cisco has great giveaways to new employees. Free onsite perks like free drinks and popcorn. Nice cafeteria facilities with good selections and reasonable prices. I liked that I could do my personal banking, stationery, and shipping at Cisco too.","Large employer; can get lost as a little fish in a huge ocean; lots of autonomy and self management expected. Had to find my own chair, computer, desk equipment on my first day - not a great first impression for a new employee. Moved 10 times in 2 years - don't get used to a place or ""home"", you'll be losing it soon. Management expectations not always clearly communicated. Feedback not always timely or direct. The only constant is change. Work not evenly distributed - some working ridiculous hours and some not hardly working at all. Perception is everything, isn't it?"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 13, 2018","Former employee, more than 5 years","Excellent campus, at least at Cessna in Bangalore.

Excellent cab facility, though the charges that contractors have to pay to avail the facility is exorbitant.
Unlimited Work-From-Home options, flexibility to arrive and leave from office any time that suits you. 
Reimbursement of broadband expense, good insurance coverage including parents, spouse and children.
Absolutely no dress-code, you can wear anything you feel like including shorts.","Major re-structuring and consequent layoffs practically every quarter in all locations and all BUs (and an annual big one around Diwali/Oct-Nov time-frame).
Exceptionally top-heavy organization where hardly any work gets done. If you are politically connected well, you will stay otherwise prepare to get fired.
Useless long-timers as managers, who keep firing people based on their likes and dislikes of people.
Dis-proportionately large numbers of Contractors as compared to FTEs (at least in Services/CX) which shows the lack of any long-term vision.
Marked discrimination between FTEs and Contractors in terms of treatment meted out (I was an FTE, so its not a disgruntled Contractor ranting).
Absolutely no touch with HRs, they only interact with you on the day of your on-boarding and thereafter only when you raise a case which will be responded soon enough. Beyond that, no interaction, to the extent that there is no Exit Interview either when you resign.
No onsite, at least none in IT.
No hikes every alternate year. And promotions are next to impossible, and even if you do get promoted do not expect any increment in package.

Product manager,1.0,"Nov 21, 2022","Former employee, more than 5 years","- Cisco has a great reputation as the industry leader in a lot of areas, particularly networking hardware and datacenter equipment, thus working at Cisco obviously is a good addition to your resume. (However the Cisco reputation is not the same as it used to be) - The offices are pretty amazing with state of the art facilities. You do not get much time to use these facilities though. But they're there. We had a mini cinema hall in the Bangalore office. It doesn't get any better than that. - Work from home option, in some teams, is quite flexible. - A well connected pickup and dropoff cab service in the Bangalore office (Not free, but costs about Rs. 2000 per month)","Where to begin - There is zero involvement from HR whatsoever. If your director/manager is exploiting you, which by the way is extremely common, you have no one to help you. Only your teammates, who are probably also being exploited. - You are completely at the mercy of your direct and second level bosses. If your team is toxic (my experience), you will suffer a lot. In the many years I have been in Cisco Bangalore, I have seen so many people in a similar situation as me. Helpless, with the only option to look outside Cisco for work. - There is no work-life balance whatsoever. If you have a geolocated team, you are expected to be available for work/meetings in all timezones. 'Night meetings' are ubiquitous and you are expected to work on weekends too. - Layoffs are so frequent that even before the upcoming layoff occurs, rumors of the next layoff are commonplace. Who is going to be laid off doesn't matter at all on the person's merit or capability, but on the relationship they have with their manager and director. - Promotion cycles get cancelled very frequently. Bonuses are more or less always meagre, with a company factor, usually below 100%, which means you get a lower bonus than your bonus target just because the overall company is always under performing. - The CEO is an ex-sales VP, who's only focussed on profits. Since Cisco is losing market share and yearly revenues are always less than $50bn, Chuck Robbins' method for maintaining profits and consequently dividends is to hire execs with the mission to lay off a huge chunk of their teams in the so called 'streamlining' initiatives. All you hear in Cisco is layoffs. - Cisco's policy of internally promoting managers based on years of service rather than capability has filled Cisco's ranks of managers with incompetant managers (and even directors) who are more suited for tech lead or project management positions. They lack vision and foresight, and are only focussed on the present. Something I feel resonates all the way to the top with Chuck Robbins and his team in many regards. - The pay, in comparison to comparable roles in comparable companies, is always low. There is huge attrition which leads to lots of instability. It's been a tremendous challenge planning projects since teams are always transient. - The hiring process for Cisco is to hire people cheap who will be able to 'do the job' rather than 'invent new products'. Getting hired by Cisco is no longer a big deal. Thus there is a huge upsurge of converting red badge employees, who are from vendor companies, to blue badge full Cisco employees. This ensures the business is run... but not changed. Cisco loses innovation and invention, and consequently its leading edge. This problem is spread across almost all teams. - There are so many layers between you and the customer, that you will probably never get the opportunity to talk to a customer directly. Which basically means you slowly lose knowledge of what the market wants. Thus when you apply outside for a new role, you know what your manager/director wants, but not what the customers want."
Software engineer iii,4.0,"Feb 24, 2015",Current employee,"Cisco is fairly friendly to working from home (I do so at least once a week; we have quite a few full-time remote workers). While changing any large company is like turning a big ship, Cisco seems more nimble than most (I've worked at one other very large IT company, and Cisco is more nimble than that one, and generally a nicer place to work). Cisco really tries to be a great place to work. It doesn't always succeed at that, but is never worse than decent. Work/life balance is pretty good. I hear horror stories from people about the lack of that; I don't hear those at Cisco.","Bad coffee, infrequent raises, middle-of-the-road salary and benefits, and we've had a lot of rounds of layoffs in the last 5 years or so."

Business plans change on a whim, and good people lose jobs. 2-3 years down the line, you will pay the price for the shallow decisions taken today.
Your experience depends on which team you join. Beware if you get an offer from teams with higher percentage of Malayalees, specially women. Most of them are horrible co-workers, even if they are good at their work. They do mean and unprofessional things to bring others down and work hard to build an empire and bring more of their kind in.
Some managers are clueless, weak, promote favouritism and play people against each other. Some of them do not possess much technical knowledge and project themselves as ""people managers"". If you sense that your manager is harming your career prospects and not letting you develop in the areas that interest you, do not let it go. Leave, or try to remedy the situation smartly.
If you are not highly competitive and don't suck up to the right people, you will not survive here. You need to be tough, question everything, and trust no one.
Every few months, you will hear news of an employee committing suicide or dying of a heart attack."
Marketing,3.0,"Feb 2, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","Generally speaking people at Cisco are nice and respectful, especially compared to other high-tech companies where I've worked. They encourage and enable job and even entire career changes within the company, so there are lots of people who have been there 10+ years (which is a pro and a con actually). From my experience elsewhere I find they pay well, especially at the more junior levels, and the bonuses have been pretty healthy. Chuck is one of the most sincere CEO's in the Valley and deeply cares about doing good as a company.","The company is going through lots of change right now with an almost entirely new exec leadership team. They seem to be finding it hard to make decisions so important things seem to be stalled (especially in marketing). Chuck says he wants to move fast and faster yet, but we seem to be moving so sloooooooowly. It's excruciating. They also are pretty open about wanting to get rid of people at the more senior levels to bring in lots of young employees. And they want to reduce hiring in San Jose in favor of less expensive locations. So job security for senior people in San Jose is dicey. And finally, they're trying really hard to be cool and hip to bring in those younger people, but it verges on embarrassing how they go about it. Wearing jeans and doing video profiles called ""meet our millennials"" doesn't do it. It's well intended though!"

For those of you who have never heard of Cisco choice program, let me tell you what it is. When I signed my offer letter, I had to choose one of the five given start dates. When I came on the first day, I saw many other new hires like me who were hired as chooice hires. For the next one month, we were bombarded with information about the company and different Business Units within the company. After a month once we have all that information, all the choice new hires get to choose the BU, the team, the manager they want to work for.  Isn't this awesome???

 Cisco gives you an opportunity to work with so many different technologies, roles and flexibility to move around. The compensation is also good which adds to the reasons to work for Cisco.","The recognition and feedback system could be better. I would like to see some healthy feedback about my job from the upper management and a recoginition for the goals accomplished.

I have also heard ( haven't experienced yet) that there is always some politics involved when it comes to promotions, passing projects and things like that.

There is no customer interaction between the engineer who actually build a product and the customers who use the product. 

Cisco should also try to focus on the overall development of its employees rather than just the area he is currently working on..

Hardware engineering manager,2.0,"May 2, 2008",Current employee,"regular paycheck, industry standard.  Will not go away tomorrow.   The company is the network hardware standard.  When anyone is putting in network infrastructure, anything that will connect to the internet,  it will go through a Cisco Systems product at one point or another.  That means they company will last a few years,   so there will be consistent employment.   If you work hard enough to convince your boss you are worthy,  and you get a mediocre or better review on your yearly talent review?  you will get paid every other week.  This does not mean you are delivering quality work or innovation,  but you are playing the game well.

it is sad.  there is so much opportunity here.","innovation is out the window.  it is becoming process laden, and totally red tape encumbered.  Layoffs every time they need to make numbers.   Management heavy.

You want 100 words or more.  Hmm.  Why?  This is exactly the problem we are having at Cisco.  You set a rigid guideline, which requires people to fill up space, even when it does not have meaning?   We are experiencing the same here.  Why host a 1 hour meeting, when the point could be conveyed in 15 minutes.

Cisco used to be a highly innovative company, delivering cutting edge products.  Now?  we struggle to get 100 words,  instead of focusing on the product."
Technical leader i,2.0,"Sep 20, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","A standard set of benefits that work.  Good health insurance, life insurance and 401k benefits.  Most departments provide the opportunity for highly flexible hours.","Yearly lay-offs are draining morale.  Engineering is viewed as a cost center, so engineering is being marginalized by getting less of the bonus pot of money than some other areas in the corporation.  We're not sure where this will lead Cisco in the future as it has traditionally been based on technology advancement.  It might end up in very dark places for an engineer based in the USA.

The best benefits (restricted stock options, for example) are reserved for only the top 5 or 10% of employees.  This is stratifying the environment, and a culture of severe envy is building.  As an engineer, obtaining the top 5% can be counter intuitive.  Technical excellence helps, but political connections are most important.  This is anathema to a typical engineer.

As an engineer, the advancements of salary and title are now extremely limited.  The upside to this is most of the engineers achieve excellent work-life balance since there is little benefit to working too hard.

All of the above started changing sharply in 2008.  Before that, it was a very different story.  Many engineers are mourning the loss of a once great Cisco."

23 years later I still love to be in this company. changed 3 times organisation from IT, Sales to CX, took several jobs from Project Manager, to Regional IT Leader, Product Sales and Business Development. And hence, this is Cisco, you career depends entirely on your ambitious, you decide where you want to be.

The company changed over the years and yes, we intend to say, where are the great days, although I strongly believe Cisco has a great future in front of it.

But what I like most are the people, I made friends, and yes you can have friends at work, all over the globe. Another great thing of working for a global company. We are really One Cisco.

And hence the perks are great, there is always better somewhere else, although the combination of general benefits together with social responsibility programs like 5 days a year to do volunteering, that makes you want to stay for a company","Ok, not everything is great, like in any other company. Like we intend to be a virtual organization, it's has it's risk for disconnect with your peers. Yes, there video and we meet once or twice a year, you have to work on building your networks, staying connected ""from a human perspective"".

Lots of locations worldwide, wide variety of software and hardware positions. Flexible work hours, telecommuting, easy to stay connected 24 x 7. Highly educated workforce, lots of very smart people to hang out with and learn from. Market leader in many many categories. Free popcorn and drinks. Engineers have access to state of the art computers, labs and networks, and access to some of the biggest customers in the world, you wouldn't have this level acceptance working for a startup or a mid-level company.","It is a large company. 2001 brought some tough downsizing but there are still a lot of people failing to live up to their potential. This is mostly due to incompetent middle management on average, folks who have gotten promoted because they've stuck around for a long time and will put up with the crap that goes on with politics and maneuvering. No more HR department, the first and second level managers are expected to ""do it all"", lead the way, set the example and motivate and train as well as be de facto technical leads and pollinate projects across groups and locations."
Sales,5.0,"Feb 14, 2011",Current employee,"The products are the best.  Sure, there is a lot of competition, but Webex is still the best.

The Boxborough office is top-notch.  There's a cafe, plenty of customer meeting space, recycling, lots of clothing/community fundraising, and a very nice gym (which I should use- they seem to have lots of classes like spin and yoga, etc).  

The coworkers are a good bunch of people- very team-like atmosphere.  There isn't really anyone I don't ""like"" - there are lots of people with different interests, and they're all good people.

The management is strong as well- honest, straightforward, and experienced.  There have been people promoted in the last year or so, and that is good to see.

Sure, sometimes you don't agree with them, but when you find a job where you agree 100% of the time with your boss, I want to know about it.  The OD here is very experienced, and one of the smartest people I've ever worked for or with.

Overall company leadership is top-notch.  HR is extremely fair.  Employees are treated like adults.","It's in Boxborough.  Just kidding- but that's it.  Lots of us drive from New Hampshire or the North Shore, and it's a bit of a hike.  Some people work out of Boston, which is good if you live further south.

- Executive leadership you can respect. 
- Good starting salaries, generous cash bonuses, good ESPP.
- Stability, many employees make a career of working here through retirement; unique in this field.
- By far the most accepting work environment for employees of diverse backgrounds; in my personal experience (comparing to Microsoft, Bank of America, Intel, Government, and some smaller techs.).","- Benefits are weak.  Insurance portion you pay is higher than other are companies. No sick days.
- Unlike most techs, stock awards and options are limited to a select few high-level folks.
- 70's sweatshop work environment: cubicles, no offices.  Bad for engineering; maybe ok for...??
- Infrastructure is clunky.  Patchwork of Oracle/Unix stuff from the '90, inefficient internal tools.
- Cisco IT sucks (sounds mean, but I'm understating.)  Product teams outsource for reliable IT.
- Promotion path is fuzzy, many employees give up in frustration and advance through leaving.
- 4 weeks PTO sounds good, but they force to use one for annual company shut-down, so it's really only 3.  And, you get no sick days, so people tend to work when ill rather than blow the family vacation, which in turn infects more people.  (Contrast with 2 sick weeks, all holidays, plus 5 weeks vacation for senior people at Microsoft and other companies.)"
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Aug 11, 2016",Current employee,"I have had a great experience starting my career at Cisco. The people I work with are friendly and always willing to answer questions, and it's great to learn from a very smart, hard working group of people. 

The compensation and benefits are beyond anything I could have asked for:
The on-site health care and fitness center are exceptional and are much less expensive than any outside vendor. 
Employees have the opportunity to earn up to an additional $800 just for logging healthy lifestyle choices too; which can be used towards any health related expenses. 
401k matching is competitive, and employee stock options are also attractive. 
The most important benefit to me is the flexibility. I work from home most days and people trust me to get my work done. Although some people have meetings early morning/late night, people are allowed to schedule their day in a way to accommodate it (mid-day appointments, taking a long lunch to go to the gym, etc.)

There are also many employee groups to take advantage of such as Connected Women, Early Career Network, and Pride. It's a great way to meet people with your same interests.","Many of the office spaces are outdated...aka cubicles. If I had to go into the office everyday for 8 hours, this would be a complaint.

Software engineer iv,3.0,"May 30, 2011",Current employee,"I have no doubt there are some good groups in Cisco. The key is to get hired into just those where politics is at a minimum and there is more focus on the engineering itself. Now pray you are not involuntarily transferred to some other group due to a reorg.
Working from home is not a problem and they have very flexible work hours as long as one is delivering. The work can be interesting.","When I started in cisco a long time ago, it was a really fun place to work. We used to be busy with actual technical projects and customer driven features that actually made sense. My peers and manager were also good, and more focused on the technical aspects than on just getting ahead in the hierarchy. Re-orgs are an integral part of cisco and I soon found myself in less than ideal company. Ended up working for worse and worse managers. There were many cliques which managers seemed to encourage. if you did the technical work expected of you and did not question the order, you were ok. In the end, visibility, how you managed upward and politicking worked much better than actually doing the engineering work well.  We sometimes buy equipment for the labs just so the budget doesn't go to waste, the equipment  lies in the labs unused.
Talkers are preferred over doers. Peers/leads were more interested in looking good (i.e. not being contradicted) than actually making good technical decisions."

When a group fails at a project the leadership moves to another group and the engineers are laid off.   Way to many VPs Directors and managers.   There are managers with only one or two people under them.   Same with Directors and VPs.   Cisco has lost its focus and the Senior Leadership team is driving the ship into the icebergs.  Pay raises and promotions are only available to the managers and above.   Cisco considers it an insult to give a 2% pay raise to cover cost of living, so they may give you 5% every 5 or 6 years.

Being in sales, Cisco is known for the sales pressure. So you got to be thick skinned. Some may buckle while some rise. That’s the nature. A bit of luck is also important ;)
Work life balance for sales folks isn’t exactly 9-5pm. (While no one questions but there is an unsaid maturity that you need to get the work done).
From compensation standpoint I think some of the FANGs are doing better. Though I won’t complain 
It isn’t the most coolest or the gen-z kinda company. So comparing to a start up or young companies would be wrong, especially in sales. Can’t comment for software engineers

New benefit offerings also speak volumes about how they care for the whole employee - longer paid bonding leaves for parents and grandparents, flexible emergency time off policy that each manager can tailor to meet their employee's needs, Time2Give which provides a full extra week of paid time off per calendar year to volunteer for a non-profit or educational institution of the employee's choice (above and beyond any team volunteering and give back events).","Cisco did not act quickly enough to shift its business model when AWS and other cloud vendors became threats.  Now we are playing catch-up.  Don't get me wrong, we have ALL the resources needed to win the catch-up game: cash on hand,  transformation strategy, excellent CFO explaining it to the street, excellent people...   

But we have some things that could drag us down:  sheer size (lack of agility),  continued success in high-margin core business (hard to decide to cannibalize yourself), high-level leaders who have been around too long, have too internal a view, little outside experience and who have succeeded too long in the old way to be willing to jump quickly to innovative strategies or new business models."

- Work life balance with commendable initiatives like wellness days off, vaccination drives and awareness sessions","- Lack of career growth. No hikes, promotions or Risus for years. Except for the chosen few. No transparency on how to progress in career.
- Constant reorgs and layoffs bringing down employee morale. Management is clueless on what works and what does not. Statements which are designed to garner positive PR does not constitute a strategy at a tech company.
- Discrimination against Indian employees. Gaslighting of Indian employees by saying what they are making now is what they are worth. Being asked to work 12-14 hours with tight deadlines whereas American colleagues go on vacations, get goodies and seem to have relaxed working hours. Lack of RSUs for Indian employees. Different grade standards - Grade 10 job posting requires atleast 12 years experience in India whereas a similar one in US might have 3-5 years as a criteria.
- Tone deaf attitude of management. HR chief laughing during layoff announcement, constantly referring to the delta variant as Indian variant, talking about promotions and business trips for leadership team whereas majority haven't recieved even a inflation correction hike. Instances are too many to list down."

Director of marketing,4.0,"Dec 28, 2008",Current employee,Cisco is a well oiled machine.  It has great support systems and if you like stability you will get on fine.  If you are aggressive you will always have the opportunity to build a good niche and possibly a great team that will give you much satisfaction.   But it won't be handed to you - you need to use your social networking skills to create the opportunity.,"The sheer size makes if inefficient.  If you come from the startup world that will wear on you after a while.  

One should stay at Cisco no more than 4 years in the same job.  If you try and go external (to startups) you will be viewed as inflexible and some significant skepticism.  This isn't always the case, but it is common to see people doing the same thing, getting stale and suddenly (maybe being pushed) to ""see what is out there."""
Project team lead,3.0,"Feb 20, 2014",Former employee,"Cisco is one of those companies that can tell you what is going to happen in 10 years.
The (sometimes tough) directions the company is taking is showing a great sense of decision-making, strategies and insight.

As for the employees they are given the best care, best tools, the best hardware, the best trainings I've seen so far in my career.","Most employees are now hired through acquisitions. That was my case.
It is a good thing in itself, but this is a real problem for the company culture, meant to be open, collaborative and turned towards the future, when former managers looking at surviving the next week come into play.

You end up in a very interesting situation where the middle management is essentially anti-productive:
- very short term thinking
- no decision making, seeking ""consensus"" (which essentially means hiding until you can't hide anymore)
- focused on personal career, not on the team development.
In this environment, blame and backstabbing are very common, and not surprisingly talents get discouraged, or leave.

I personally loved my job and Cisco, and got caught in the middle of a management lack of decision, rendering months of hard work into dust, where a simple professional discussion could have solved the matter."

They have no culture of innovation or risk taking. The development team is just focused on short term gains.  As an engineer I was bored out of my mind porting crappy work from other divisions that were favored even though more than once we have developed a better solution.  Five years later they relented and let us rework that project to produce better reliability.  But it was after the issues that caused them to lose customers.  I worked in a BU that was managed by one culture and unless you went to the same temple and were part of that dynasty you were passed up for promotions and good projects.  They cleaned up some house since 2009 but the same issues take place that I discussed earlier.  I can tell the issues I raised still remain to this day when I interview unhappy Cisco engineers that sound defeated and frustrated and want to work elsewhere.

My sign should have been when we could not attract college grads to join.  I have to say I learned very little as a development engineer in the 10+ years I worked there.  I did learn a lot about networking however."

The answer to any situation in any climate is to cut headcount. We're making money? Layoffs!  We're losing money? Layoffs!  Stagnant?  It doesn't matter!  That might be easier to understand if we didn't constantly buy companies like they're on the candy rack next to the cashier at the supermarket.  (Seriously, we average about one acquisition a month.)

Also, Cisco tends to award bonuses as part of its compensation package instead of pay raises. The amount is roughly equivalent to the amount you might get as a pay raise elsewhere, but pay raises compound over time, where bonuses do not."
Senior hardware engineer,4.0,"Sep 29, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","It's a large company, so there's not a lot of opportunity to change the world in engineering, but there is plenty for changing your career through parallel roles, management positions, and training.  Of course the work is completely flexible with little travel, so the day-to-day can be very predictable.  They really make it ""comfortable"" for every employee, if you want two monitors, a separate chair, late working hours, and a predictable annual review, then it's a not going to be problem.  That's great if you're looking for just this.","Cisco gets all it's innovations through acquisitions (or so upper management believes), so there's not a lot of risk taken within the company to do so.  Therefore, any mature technologies are in sustaining cost-cutting mode.  That means lab budgets are reduced, annual lay offs are common, and the cube space is downsized towards open environments.  If you just work to get your work done, this is okay, but if you want your work to be fun and exciting, this is a serious downer.  That's why there are fewer young people applying."
It engineer,3.0,"Oct 28, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years",A truly flexible work life balance that most leadership and employees emulate and practice in.  This can be a great benefit for those that are more mature in their life and require the flexibility or just need the ability to take care of errands and tasks without being bound to work hours.,"Cisco under pays their IT staff which is predominantly made up of contractors (over half).  It's as if Cisco believes it's still in its early 2000 heydays hiring cheaper contractors to manage their ever-growing supply of products and software services that never achieve a respectable integration.  Any engineer worth their salt would immediately turn away from the lack of respect in their woefully below market pay for IT Engineers while asking for the cream of the crop.  The greed is evident in their low base salary for the position to accommodate for their loose definition of what they constitute as an IT Engineer.  Yet, they will still have the gall to go recruit for quality engineers with the position and continue to be surprised when they lose recruit after recruit to their more informed competitors."

Director,5.0,"Dec 27, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is very much a meritocracy -- where folks are empowered to be innovative and provide leadership, vision, and join in strategic direction of the company.  Folks who succeed here need to be self-starters, and Cisco rewards such performers with many opportunities to work in many different functional areas of the company.   Cisco's culture is one that has no pre-conceived notions of social status, or placing value on where people went to college or received their MBA degrees.   From my experience, the best managers and leaders who get promoted are those who delivered the goods, or stepped up and led others.   

In my long tenure at Cisco, I've been given many different jobs and roles, and it's that on-going commitment from Cisco to aid me in my learning and career development, that makes this such a great place to work.","People who ""ask for the ball"" are given it, and Cisco rewards such performers.

Senior finance manager,5.0,"Feb 23, 2012",Current employee,"Speaking from a finance org. perpsective, those rotational opportunities can be abroad, to completely different functions and even into a completely different org.

Certainly not a place for someone who wants to cruise. There is the everpresent corporate ""shmooze game"" here to move up the ladder but I feel that career advancement opportunities here are still more merit based than in other Fortune 500 companies I've worked at. You can make a huge impact in big dollar impacting processes even if you're a jr. analyst.","Based on HR's ivory tower benchmarking of total compensation, Cisco is competitive in the industry. But I'd say it's far from a leader given the flight we've seen in talent to both competitors and all the hot names in tech right now. Proof is in the pudding. No ""little perks to show we care"" here like free meals and the like. People are still seething over the loss of free sodas and juice from a couple three years back.

Strong mentoring - employees wishing to go the extra mile to help and guide colleagues","Frequent lay-offs - often told things cannot happen due to layoffs, which have happened almost every year since 2009. Creates a negative culture of fear.
Untrustworthy senior management - related to the layoffs
Unclear employee metrics - SEs and related roles are purely at the mercy of their manager when it comes to performance reviews, which in turn directly affects promotion prospects, pay rises and so on.
Questionable hiring choices - lots of new ""SE 1"" roles being hired instead of the more common SE 2-3. This lack of experience causes resourcing and customer perception issues.
Shouters rewarded - those who make themselves visible and 'shout the loudest' are most likely to receive rewards, recognition and promotion"

One that I am proud to have been a part of.","Constant reorganisations and product changes can be quite dizzying. But this is what makes the company so successful.

Career progression can be difficult in such a large organisation that has very low attrition. Especially when stuck in a niche industry or speciality.

The company attitude is very USA-centric. If reporting directly into a USA group, there will be very little understanding or respect for cultural values outside of their domain. This is challenging.

This translates to a mountain of bureaucracy, with hundreds of internal groups, some deeply removed from customers.  The group I worked for went by an acronym, and no one, not even my manager who had been there for 20 years, could recount what the acronym meant or how they came to get it exactly.

Cisco seems to have an existing informal agreement with employees: we will hire you as a contractor, and one day, many years from now, you will become permanent.  May be 2 years, may be 5.  That's a long time for commitment in the tech sector, so it attracts folks who are willing to slog it out and are looking for long-term, safe employment.

A newer model was developing as I was leaving, which is diametrically opposed to this, was outsourcing.  So after toughing it out for years and doubling-down on Cisco, you might discover that one day a foreign employee on a visa, or many, many foreign employees with visas suddenly appear.  It's your job to train them in how to do your job.  Sound scary?  It sure was to the 55 year olds I worked with."
Marketing executive,3.0,"Aug 1, 2016","Former employee, more than 5 years","Cisco the company is solid. Generally nice working conditions, perks, compensation, programs. 

The company, though, is growing very very slowly (5% would be a strong year), and not always in the hottest fastest-growth areas (cloud, security). So, it grows primarily through acquisition of other companies to bolster lackluster organic expansion. 

It's a bit like working at a utility company. Nothing too exciting. Shallow dips and small peaks; nothing to write home about. Nothing earth-shattering or particularly innovative on its own, so it acquires growth. In order to maintain steady headcount, layoffs are frequent and predictable.","As with most larger companies, there are departments and programs that are run well, and some to avoid.  

The Marketing & Communications team is an unmitigated disaster. Since a new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) was appointed in mid-2015, there have been at least six layoffs of varying sizes in Marketing alone, with more always on the horizon. Marketing leadership has been decimated in a purge to remove anyone who might not be loyal to the latest CMO and her hatchet-man.  VPs, Directors, Managers, and Individual Contributors are all whacked -- and as usual, the best people have left.

Steer clear of Cisco Marketing, but otherwise the company is pretty good although slow-moving and middle of the road."

Frugality is crazy for one of the biggest and most profitable companies in the world - e.g. soda and fruit removed from staff.  No free gym for example which other large companies provide for free.  Raises few and far between and too few promotions, especially for technical staff.  Lost its way on Routing and switching but thank goodness this has been recognized and resources refocused.  Training for such an innovative company amounts to little more than ""read about it on the intranet or internal webexs that are always business focused.  Training is what others do, not Cisco employees...  You could work 24x7 and no-one would know, or care.  ""Visibility"" is the key word at Cisco.  If what you do is not visible to others you'll get no-where.  Bring people in from outside on much higher salary and do not promote from within, even those who have developed significantly.  Lost the focus of a start-up and too much emphasis on the CIO conversation.
All these things are correctable but they need to make rapid progress since able technical staff are drifting away from Cisco."
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Apr 2, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years",Stable company with decent benefits.,"I've been with Cisco well over 10 years and have seen the environment get worse and worse.  Many of the comments here are flat out WRONG if you are in development (at least in my group).  

Cisco is rolling out Agile, but in a non-sensical manner.  Worst of all, they have manipulated / misrepresented this Agile adoption to the rest of the company.  As a result, this dysfunctional version of Agile is being adopted in other groups as well.

- Work/life balance is paid lip service, but is NOT a priority.  The Agile construct gives them an excuse to try and get people to work extra hours on a consistent basis.

- Work from home is not encouraged in my group, nor even allowed for most people.  This seems strange coming from Cisco that creates infrastructure encouraging such an environment.  Note again, this is a by-product of the dysfunctional Agile, and does not apply to all groups.

- Compensation is mediocre at best, though as mentioned, at least you don't worry about your paycheck bouncing.

- Cisco has mandatory PTO over the holidays every year.  So while on paper, you get 4 weeks PTO, in reality you lose nearly a full week to the mandatory shutdown.  This is one of the cheesiest moves I've seen a company make.


In a nutshell, if you are applying for a position at Cisco, and they tell you they are Agile... Just walk away."

Network engineer,2.0,"Jun 14, 2010",Current employee,Pay is enough to make a living if needed (although barely). It's fun working with new and exciting protects and technology.,"Cisco used to be the place to work. It was a company once plagued with brilliant and talented engineers. Even so, the company and management would go out of the way to make sure one was compensated for hard work, brilliant ideas, game-changing strategies, and good 'ole focused and hard work.

Now? Don't hold your breathe.

Moving up in the company (not necessarily into management positions, but rather getting promoted and raises) is impossible. I had a conversation recently with an HR rep only to have her admit during the course of our discussion that the only way to get a decent raise at Cisco is to leave the company and then come back later.

I'm looking forward to leaving Cisco and finding a company that has more growth potential -- a place that values its employees and cares about their livelihoods. Cisco used to be a fun, energetic and exciting company to work for (a lot like Google). Now it's just another bureaucratic jungle with little room for employee satisfaction."
Technical leader,2.0,"Jan 19, 2012",Former employee,"Co-workers were great. Very little in the way of office politics among non-managerial co-workers. Work environment was excellent, and I generally had all the equipment I needed. Salary was the on the high end. If you're fortunate to land in a group doing new development and be assigned that work, then the work can be very exciting.","In the video group I was in, the low level management was in constant flux, so there was no loyalty to direct reports. Sometimes as many as 3 managers telling a team of 2 engineers what to do. While there was a high level of technical skill and work ethic among managers, their managerial people skills were terrible. Software engineers treated more as cogs than people. Large influx of contractors added to this feeling. John Chambers preaches the ""Cisco is family"" ethic... I saw no evidence of it here. While I had occasional times of good work, most of work was boring... fixing or triaging bugs mainly. I know a co-worker still working there, one of the sharpest engineers I know, have his project cancelled. He's now talking of leaving in a couple of years. When I was there, the video group was constantly being reorganized. There is some opportunity to move around, but you're just as likely to get stuck in a dead-end job. I was very happy to leave this company."
Account manager,5.0,"Aug 7, 2018","Current employee, more than 3 years","Cisco is a very good company to work for. 

There are countless smart people around that are willing to help. It’s an innovative company in either acquisition or development which means you’ll never be bored, plus we have excellent portals and content for learning.

You need to acknowledge the days dedicated to “giving back” i.e 5 days for you to spend doing your chosen charity work. There is great flexible working and amazing tools that help make that easy.

It’s a company lots of people feel proud to work for and many people spend a number of years at. Plus I’ve seen a lot of people leave and then come back because Cisco really is one of the best companies to work for.","There are typical examples of inwardly focused management and intolerably lazy people but they can be avoided. My main wish is that it was easier to move around the world, you often hear that it’s very difficult to move countries which is disappointing given the company is so global."

If you expect that just doing good work and working hard will matter you will be disappointed. Making Excel spreadsheets and copying nearly everyone on an email is a far more useful skill.
-There's always a negativity from managers and false stress sent down from them. I had four different managers and even the best ones always seemed to be negative about something. I didn't realize this until I changed companies and realized just how much better the environment could be.  This must come from higher management because even the good managers were like this. My new job just doesn't have this nonsense.

Director,5.0,"Oct 7, 2018","Current employee, more than 10 years","I have worked at Cisco for over 20 years in development and services organization and it has been a fun ride. What I love about Cisco is that at its heart it is truly customer focused company. If what you are doing is right for our customers you don't need to be a ""somebody"" to make it happen.

As a woman there are two things that I really like about Cisco:
#1 - If you get results, you will be rewarded. I have had good career progression by working hard on important things.
#2 - Workplace flexibility, we have all the tools we need to work wherever and whenever we need to. This lets me work hard and balance being available to my family.

The other thing which I love, love, love about Cisco is its commitment to giving back. This is part of the DNA of the company from the beginning. I call it ""entrepreneurial CSR"" because the company just encourages us to ""go for it"" and follow our passions in giving back to our communities. We get 5 days volunteering per year which the Cisco foundation matches with a cash donation for every hour we volunteer.","Change - if you don't like change, this is not the right place for you.

Solutions consultant,3.0,"Feb 20, 2020","Current employee, more than 5 years","Telecommute, worked with global team colleagues, my team always had each other's back ALWAYS.","~45% of Cisco workers are ""contingent"" (contract); the majority should be full-time employees. Too many managers are way too political and are here for their own self gains even by stepping on employees who work for them, my level of trust with most managers was low; I will say I had 2 managers I would follow to the end of world (one was a Sr Director and one was a Sr Manager - fabulous, this was 6 years ago and they are now gone, they had 20 years at Cisco).  Some managers I questioned (to myself no one else) why they had their role and it was clear they had connections and were ""covered"". I've been in IT for over 25 years and Cisco is the worse I've ever seen. I have this love/hate relationship: 1) I need to telecommute (EXCELLENT) due to family; 2) Cisco treats employees as replaceable cogs (BAD) in a machine, raises may take 3-5 years to get one. Yeah, it's a right to work environment, this isn't Cuba. If I'm expected to be loyal and jump when they say jump, I expect management to do a better job of supporting their charges. Like I said, not all are bad, but too many, IMHO, are. I've been a manager and leader, and have always respected and supported my charges."

There are very many talented people working together to innovate and bring amazing products and services to the market.,"The tail wags the dog. Thousands of hours and millions of dollars are wasted every quarter as a result of cumbersome and antiquated code and a compensation system that actually rewards poorly performing sales teams for flipping deals and stealing commissions. On the one hand, we tell our partners to invest with us and trust us that we know where the market is headed. On the other hand, when the do exactly as directed, we do nothing to protect them when they place deals into our ordering system in good faith, only to find that it suited some sales guy to turn around and fulfill it some other way in order to make his quota."
Account manager - global service provider,5.0,"Aug 30, 2019","Current employee, more than 5 years","- The company culture is incredible (I can count on 1 hand the people I've met in 5 years that I haven't liked or thought weren't a good fit). 
- There are plenty of opportunities for movement within the company and most people are willing to help
- Amazing opportunities for early in career (I went through the CSAP ASR sales program and it has been a fast track into major account management)
-Company values the opinions and work of early in career (have had meetings w/ VP's who treat you as an equal)
- 401K, ESPP, travel (if desired), unlimited trainings (on both technology/career growth), team building/volunteer events,  intramural, etc.
- For a 70K person company, they do an amazing job keeping a family like feel
- Compensation for sales reps are above industry standards and AM's are typically goaled within reason.
- Work from home, own your own schedule, no micromanagement.","I have not had a bad experience in my 5 years at Cisco. This company has fast tracked my career and has given me the  flexibility to travel back home frequently to visit my family after a tragedy. 

Like any company or role, your manager controls your happiness and quality of day to day life and the bad managers at this company in sales are few and far between.

There are a small list of companies I'd ever consider leaving Cisco for and it would take quite the offer."

Integrated marketing communications manager,5.0,"Apr 25, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco offers tremendous career and growth opportunities and a very collaborative environment. John Chamber's strong leadership fosters innovation and is also reflected by Sr. Management. It is exciting to work for a company that has been financially stable and has been extremely successful and growing for the past decade. Cisco also employs some of the smartest people and working here offers the opportunity to meet them and widen one's own horizon. There are an unlimited number of ways to engage yourself in initiatives and programs either within or even outside the work environment such as Green Initiatives, Volunteer activities and other community services. In summary, I think Cisco is the very best place to work for in today's high-tech industry due to its technology and market leadership, innovation and strong brand.","Due to its collaborative environment, there are generally too many meetings one has to attend during the day which makes it challenging to find enough time to get the actual work done and being productive. In addition, Cisco is a workplace that requires constant availability through being always connected to email, IM, smartphones etc. which leads to an extremely high level of disruption. Decision making processes can take quite a while because so many people across all different organizations and theatres need to be involved. Another challenge is prioritization of projects as there are often too many for one person to handle."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"For what I do, I have reasonable deadlines and usually clearly defined goals. I'm rarely bored at my job.","When budgets are cut then you read what VPs make, it makes you wonder where all the money is going. I have to bust my butt for a few shares of stock while VPs routinely exercise HUNDREDS of thousands of shares of stock. The company says they're Web 2.0 savvy but they're really not. Hiring young talent is an issue. When all the execs wear 3-piece suits and drive fancy cars and expect you to dress like them when meeting with them, it's going to be a challenge to hire a bright young person who wants to wear shorts to work. Many of the executives don't blog or use new web technologies to do their jobs or live their lives. I think some of them have their heads too high up in the clouds. The buildings are atrocious; they're all tan and beige inside and out."
Account manager,4.0,"Feb 23, 2009",Current employee,"Stable market leader that is never satisfied with the status quo.  Their products are second to none, and they truly understand the value of products that compliment each other.  They use all their own products internally and that certainly lends credibilty in the sales process.  They have a very good benefits package and provide 4 weeks of vacation per year to new employees.","Work / Life balance is something that is talked about all the time, however it is very hard to achieve, especially at the end of each quarter.  Sales is a tough game with any company, however at Cisco your territory and your quota don't always align.  A brand new rep right out of their training program can achieve 115% of quota (with no true sales experience), while a seasoned individual can be ""worked out"" of the company depending upon the geographical piece of dirt each is given.    At the end of each fiscal year, accounts are shuffled and territories are re-aligned, which means unless you are a global account manager, you aren't going to be calling on the same customer more than 12 months.  Very hard to become a trusted advisor to a customer in this scenario."
Senior engineer,2.0,"Apr 16, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco offers the ability to gain exposure to many different technologies while working for a single company.  Pay and benefits are very good and while the workload is high, it is not ""startup"" hours for the most part.  Cisco can be many different companies depending on which group you are in or whether your programs are in favor or not.  High visibility programs, senior exec. sponsored initiatives can be good experiences, while other extremely important core business can feel very unappreciated.","Cisco continues to move jobs overseas despite being incredibly/ off the charts profitable.  Cisco has a globalization strategy to develop products for low cost geographies in those geographies and have access to global talent.  This strategy makes sense, but the way budgets are handled, the individual business units are simply shedding higher cost US jobs.  The way the businesses are rewarded and budgeted, it is all about headcount expense these days.  I really wish Cisco would show more integrity here and show a little loyalty to its workforce."
Consulting systems architect,4.0,"Nov 16, 2011",Current employee,"Great engineers and perhaps the best place to work if you are a network guy or IP guy. Information sharing within company is excellent and there will be dozens of people coming forward to share with you when you shout for help.
The single best aspect of benefits/work is flexible timings. No one asks you what time you are coming or going as long you deliver the results.
Training is wonderful and opportunities to learn are tremendous. Connecting & networking aspects are great if you are in the consulting or sales roles.","Single biggest problem is bureaucracy. you'd be surprised to see the amount of documentation required for ""internal processes"" and most of the times you spend time internally rather than externally. i.e. with Customer.
Top management is OK but the problem lies @ middle layer. most of the times they've their own agendas and its frustrating to manage the different agendas.
Work-life balance is quite bad as most of the time you're lost in the tons of emails, documents and ever lasting meetings/webex calls. If you happen to be in the technical sales then literally you work almost every day including weekends & public holidays due to the ""urgent requests"" from customers and AM's.
Heavy focus on USA makes things difficult for people working in rest of the regions too.."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Feb 6, 2018",Current employee,"- Opportunity to explore and learn a wide spectrum of technologies 
- You get to interact with several great engineers
- Excellent WPR services, be it Gym, Transport, Cafeteria, etc.
- Very responsive support system (IT, HR, etc)","- A lot of visionary top leaders have left the organization in last few years. The current top management is unable to connect with engineers. They lack vision, charisma and motivational skills and just know how to use whip and do some program management. Have absolutely no interest in building team dynamics or developing the career of engineers, and seem to be mainly focused on their own job security and progress.
- For an individual contributor, career becomes stagnant after around 10 years, unless you are in the ""good books"" of someone in the top. But this may not be specific to this organization but a common Indian thing. There are a lot of stringent criteria that will be used deny a promotion for an IC. However, in the management ladder, you could see mediocre folks getting promoted quickly and growing in the path just because they have some X number of people under them and are able to squeeze more work on less number of people, etc.
- Work life balance is not great, with several managers indirectly promoting working close to 24x7.  I am sure this sort of work culture would have considered as a strong violation of labor laws if it were in some European country. Again, this is not a Cisco specific thing, but a normal scenario in Indian IT industry."

When mistakes were made, they were acknowledged and treated as learning opportunities and individuals who genuinely work hard get recognized.  We have a great Inclusion & Diversity team and there are diverse leaders that help individual contributors gear up to bringing their whole selves to work. If it were not for the Employee Resource Organizations (EROs) / Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), working at Cisco would not feel impactful. I am grateful that we have an Inclusion & Diversity team and leaders that support the EROs so that leaders of the EROs can work to change the culture positively throughout Cisco.",Not all organizations / teams in Cisco are open to all diversities and do not promote inclusion & diversity. It is not easy to be an LGBT employee in certain groups at Cisco and bring your whole self to work for fear of being treated differently.  Cisco tends to be a follower in inclusion and diversity trends rather than a leader in trends when it comes LGBT employee needs.

Senior software engineer,3.0,"Oct 28, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is an Industry Leader in so many categories. It  has a great brand name. There are immense learning opportunities. It may be a very good employer especially when starting out fresh in your career. The executive management does a very good job communicating to all employees the direction and strategy of the company.
There is a awesome benefits package with gymns and other health benefits. There are incentive programs to promote innovation and out of the box thinking. The company also supports employee development by reimbursing tuition fees. They also have a dedicated facility to train employees in various skills.","It appears to be an overcrowded place. It appears that the pie is too small and too many people are trying to get a piece of it. This creates lot of bad blood among employees. Employees are competing with each other and often conspiring against each other instead of working together as a team to stay ahead of competition from industry peers. The engineering management would get better results if they spent some time in people management.  While the company support career development initiatives, the opportunities are too few and rare even though you may have the skills needed for the job.  Engineering promotions below a certain level are not announced, but silently updated in the directory - doesn't help transparency."
Technical marketing engineer,1.0,"Apr 8, 2009",Current employee,"The best reason to work at Cisco is purely to get Cisco on your resume.  The company still garners respect from the name recognition.  It is also a great place to learn how big business works, with lots of management that does very little and if you are the little guy you will get to see what it is like to get dumped on all the time, which will let you develop techniques to deal with stress and overwork.  Any job at Cisco will teach you office politics and give you insight into how playing politics can help you get ahead in a big company.  These skill are invaluable if you are planning on working at large companies for most of your career.","You will not be compensated very well, you will not receive very good benefits, you will be forced to dealing with lots of change without any input into the decisions or how they will be implemented.  You are forced to deal with LOTS of management, including VPs that don't even have anyone that report to them.  Generally you will be at the mercy of the upper management and whatever benefits you have now will be slowly taken away, without you getting a say into how, why or when they will go away."
Program manager,3.0,"Jun 1, 2012","Former employee, more than 10 years","Freedom to think outside the box and bring creative solutions to problem resolutions. You will have the opportunity to expand your skil levels and work outside your defined job role as desired.  Due to the size, opportunity to change groups to broaden experience.  Definitely a great work experience, but do not stay in the same role, gain experience and then move on to enrich your resume. Do not stay too long if you have career goals.","Political beast - promotion is difficult unless you are adept at working the system.  Projects tend to be grossly underfunded and understaffed in some organizations, with unrealistic expectations.  Other organizations are well funded with budget, resources and adequate timelines. 

Management will push initiatives which will increase their political position and opportunity for the next promotion - not what is the best move for the company.  Leaders have lost vision - initiatives are created reactively, not proactively and tossed over the wall for implementation with little or no planning."
Engineering director,4.0,"Feb 13, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","Despite Cisco's revenue, product, and market challenges, it's still one of the best places to work.  Compensation, benefits, and rewards and recognition are top of the line compared to other companies of similar size, maturity, and industry.  Senior leadership is very communicative about strategy, company strengths and weaknesses, decisions, and goals.  Also, Cisco has been very effective in moving leadership around and slimming down the executive band to allow lower levels to grow and ensure the company doesn't get ""stuck"" in it's ways as some companies do by keeping senior leadership locked into roles (examples include changes in HR, IT, Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Engineering leadership over the last 5 years.","Cisco continues to be unclear and ineffective in expanding it's product and industry space.  High-end video, consumer products (Linksys and Scientific Atlanta acquisitions), Education and Health industry, etc. have been major investments that haven't moved Cisco's advancement in the industry successfully.  Data Center and Security products have been good moves, but more creative new industries haven't worked yet.  It's been hard to move Cisco from just the best routers and switches company in the world to a more futuristic service and product provider.
Also, it's been hard to attract and keep young talent (millenials) so new blood and true innovation is a bit difficult despite that Cisco has some of the most amazing technology, sales, and business development employees in the world."

- Great company to have on your resume.
- They offer fantastic work-life balance and flexible work options. I worked from home almost the entire time I was there and loved it. They provide the tools you need to work from anywhere.
- Excellent benefits; employee health insurance premiums are really low.
- They employ some incredibly smart people, and I believe that the new CEO is going to do great things.
- It's a fantastic company for engineers; they are the star employees.","- They have a difficult history of annual layoffs, and the dust is still settling with the new CEO in place and the changes he's making to the organization.
- Cisco is not generous with merit increases and promotions are difficult to come by.
- Cisco is a behemoth of a company. As such, processes for getting anything done are complex and slow.
- Don't expect a lot of handholding as you start your job. Cisco prides itself on being a ""self service"" company. That means you have to figure out how to get things done."
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Oct 16, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","There are a lot of business units in Cisco with a lot of projects, it's possible to move around to find team and project that suits one the best. Recently there is a lot of talk about AI and some teams are using it, others are exploring options. Benefits are good, four weeks of vacation, accrued PTO, not ""unlimited"" like in many companies, 4.5 % match on 401K contributions, bonus, better health insurance than many companies, ESPP - you can save up to 10% of salary to buy stock with at least 15% discount. Cisco gives the lowest price for last 2 years (on ESPP buy dates) minus 15%, nice. In most teams work/life balance is good. It's possible to work on really big projects and products that most of startups can't handle.","It's a huge company, so there is more ""paperwork"" than in startups, reporting hours spent, creating and closing user stories and tickets... Also, there are slackers, and for long time those people can go by with doing almost nothing just because they are friends with their manager. Cisco has quarterly layoffs, usually small, once a year, in September to November a big one. Regardless of how much you contribute you may be let go just because the business unit is not as profitable as some others."
Customer success specialist,4.0,"Sep 6, 2020","Current employee, less than 1 year","Cisco is a great company,with lots of flexibility , they appreciate your dedication and hard work , it empowers and give employees the freedom to deliver to their full potential. 
It is a company that is constantly looking for excellence. 
It is a great diverse place. 
Great work life balance.
We work on the newest technologies, with modern processes that help Cisco (and us as employees) to stay ahead of the curve!
Great environment and atmosphere to work.
They appreciate the change and willing to listen to any ideas.
Dealing with customers is always facilitated.
Working for customer adoption is one of the unique and amazing experience.
Cisco is always looking forward to deliver the best experience and technologies for its customers.
Cisco is always coping with the new management and new organizational architectures.","Most of the teams are dispersed over large geographical regions and you feel some how that you have weak connections even within your team.
There is no clear instructions to follow for your onboarding ,also there is no clear path for self or technical development.
It is very hard to fully comprehend all the teams and specializations as it is so many with lots of functions.
Technical labs is some how hard to find and setup and different labs is found for different teams.
Lots of information scattered all over the internal pages , community , spaces with no single source of truth and no a standard way to organize these materials and data.
No clear goals nor appraisal criteria.
Layoffs Due to economy are difficult."
Engineering technical leader,4.0,"Mar 4, 2021","Current employee, more than 10 years","I think we need to evaluate a company based on many fronts.

1. Continuous learning: Cisco invests a lot in employees' learning. There are a lot of training offerings (paid-free, instructor-led - virtual), which anyone can enroll and learn a new skill. We can apply these new skills in any POC project and showcase them in wider forums, and get them productized.

2. Multiple companies: Cisco can be treated as multiple companies under one roof. Employees have the option of testing different waters and settle in their choice. We plan our own future.

3. Tons of great ancillary options: Be it Gym, medical support, reasonable WFH, no-strict 9-5 regime, healthy food menu in the canteen, Cisco has it all.","Turning to the other side of the coin, Cisco has its own share of improvements to focus on. To start with:

1. Agility: Cisco is heavily banking on the brand and vast customer base. It has to move out of its comfort zone and play a vital role in the 'Innovation' area and be agile.

2. Pay: End of the day, paycheck matters too, nothing can compensate for that. It's widely known that Cisco is not a great paymaster. Time and again it was brought to management notice, but negligible improvements so far. The HR team has to innovate themselves on how to retain people, improve employee happiness index, and shed the legacy model of hikes and promotions."

Essentially you're up against everyone else within your pay grade for a promo. That can potentially be a lot of people you have to our maneuver for extra dosh.
- Cultural shift in recent years towards loud and brash ""sell, sell, sell"" model, away from raw engineering and capability, that arguably made Cisco what it is today. 
- Almost too large now for engineers to be taken seriously unless they are architects / systems engineers or very senior and even then that's probably giving those folk too much credit. 
- Can be political but so can every work place"
Systems engineering manager,5.0,"Aug 31, 2019","Current employee, more than 10 years","I started my career in the CSAP program, coming directly from University. From the beginning I had tremendous support and felt the positive vibe in the company. You are always encouraged and empowered to find own solutions. I have always felt an incredible amount of trust - which let you simply grow. But if you ask for help - there will always someone available to help.
The culture is very supportive - not only on the professional, but also on the private life. Being a mother myself it helps to have a home office and flexible working hours to balance family and Cisco. 
Cisco deeply cares about giving back - every employee gets additional 5 days annually for local giving back activities. It is so inspirational to get this opportunity.","This culture works probably not for everybody. You have to have a sense of purpose for yourself and drive your own projects. If you prefer to have a detailed description and predefined steps what you have to do - Cisco is probably not the right company for you. In order to be successful you have to be self motivated, creative and the courage to succeed. And since you are so empowered - it can also be difficult to limit yourself to healthy work hours. You will be encouraged to care for yourself naturally - nevertheless there is no ""clocking in / clocking out"", hence there is always something to do - and you need to be able to set yourself healthy limits."
Senior business architect,4.0,"Feb 25, 2021","Former employee, more than 10 years","Cisco is a forward-looking company, but execution does sometimes get wrapped around the axle of politics. Cisco manages to stay where it is through the occasional big technology breakthrough, like Encrypted Traffic Analytics and thanks to brand, heft, and the fact that no one ever got fired for buying Cisco. The company is making good progress now in their transformation from a products company to a software/subscriptions company. This is an amazing accomplishment that should be credited to Chuck Robbins and his management team. While John Chambers grew a behemoth from a strong up-and-comer, and was a wizard at integration of acquisitions (for the most part), but he could not make this transformation, though he'd tried for years. It's a company with a bright future in cloud and security.","Too many decisions are made because of the HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion), whether or not it's the right thing to do.

If you keep your head down, don't rock the boat, and don't think outside the box, you'll do fine.","Rewards & recognition are hard to come by - you have to work the political game well to get management recognition for your work.
Upward mobility is also very hard to achieve with entrenched employees and very little movement, other than horizontal.
You are judged not on how well you do your work, but on who you know and your political clout.
A very passive-aggressive workforce who will smile in your face and agree with you, then undermine you and not help - only unless it serves them in their political gain.
Employee Monsters are easily recognizable, but are allowed to wreak havoc because management avoids all possible conflict (see: passive-aggressive)

Virtual customer success manager,4.0,"Jan 3, 2018","Current employee, more than 1 year","- Great work-life balance, and very open culture between colleagues and various teams
- Everyone in the team is very supportive of each other, and always keen to share best practices and their own experiences
- Customer Success is a new team in Cisco, but we are seeing large support from the CEO and Sales Leaders as Cisco makes the shift to selling more recurring revenue solutions. This is definitely the fastest growing team; and possibly where there is good career growth!","A lot of KPIs that the management is pushing for in a bid to prove the value of the Customer Success team.  Cisco is a sales organization, so there is large pressure for creation of expand opportunities. Even though there is so much push to get those KPIs fulfilled, people on the ground are limited due to the strange way in which the expand opportunities are measured.  This is especially difficult in APJ region due to resistance from internal stakeholders. 

Everyone in the team came in very excited and motivated about Customer Success, but I am seeing some level of disillusionment and exhaustion to keep up with ever-changing performance measures, tools, new offers with little to no time to adjust, and high pressure from the managers.

Also experiencing ""growing pains"" with large number of new members in the team."

Consulting systems engineer,5.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"They trust you to get you job done with little supervision.  I can usually set the times I travel and develop my own pace of what I want to work on.  Usually I can set my schedule up to a month out and I will know what I'm working on.  Managers work with you to ensure that you are helping you and the bottom line of Cisco.

I also like the flexible hours and the allowance of working from my home.  Many times I will not get inspired until late at night and I will work in to the early morning.  As long as I meet my commitments for the next day, Cisco supports me working when I need to.","Little guidance on what it takes to get promoted to the next level.  Many companies have this problem where they have fuzzy guidance as to what it really takes to move up to the next level.  I think this is a problem for those that are task oriented (as that is one of the skills Cisco Hires).  If there were a specific matrix that helped guide people to where they want to be in 3-5 years and even 10 years out, then Cisco would have a world class system of retaining people as one would always know where one's career is going."
Software engineer iii,3.0,"Jun 16, 2008",Current employee,Cisco is a huge company and you can spend a career jumping from group to group every few years and never work on the same thing over again. Despite what a lot of the reviews here claim Cisco does pay what they should be paying. Some of the business units within Cisco treat their employees better than others and it would be wise to interview with more than one if you're considering a switch to Cisco.,Cisco is a huge company and you can spend a year drowning in bureaucracy and fighting for change within groups that refuse to do things any better than they ever have before. Some engineers at Cisco are incredibly smart whereas other engineers are incredibly dense. Cisco prefers quantity over quality not only in their employees but also in their products. Shipping a half-baked product on a silly schedule to meet some arbitrary marketing deadlines just seems wrong. No one at Cisco seems to care that their products have a terrible reputation and without the brand recognition no one would buy them. Cisco India (Bangalore) is definitely focused on keeping seats warm rather than building a quality engineering force.
Software engineer iv,4.0,"Aug 29, 2008",Current employee,"Good benefit, completive scalars, flexible working schedules.","Has all the problems that a big company has. The company tried to change this by introducing a CDO college new hire program, and hoping the fresh blood can give more momentum to Cisco. But the result is just the opposite as what it was designed for originally. At first the screening process of the CDO program is too easy. Lots of new hire coming through this program are very high paid without a matching quality. And once they are choosen by the CDO program, they are offered to free pick any group to work for within Cisco. A lots of managers love to get them, just because the first year budge if coming from the company, not the BU. And the following years, if you got more people, you got more budgets. But very often the team can not swallow this much new college grades and sometimes the group doesn’t even have much work for them to do at all. So many of them end up sitting around, and picking up the bad culture of Cisco quickly, This further ruins the culture at Cisco, as an indirect result of it many senior and well experienced people are leaving Cisco."
Systems engineer,5.0,"Aug 25, 2015","Current employee, more than 3 years","I have been with Cisco for 3 years and I believe overall that this is an outstanding company to work for. This is the first company I have worked for that actually recognizes, values and *compensates* you for hard work. And if you prove to management your value and contributions to the overall company, they will absolutely take care of you when it comes to things such as relocation, education, and schedule flexibility. Since collaboration technologies are a huge part of the business model, there are a lot of remote work options (i.e. work from home, road, etc.) - but this depends on your exact role in the company.","The dreaded ""work/life"" balance is probably the number one complaint across Cisco employees but it is what you make of it. I know plenty of people that work at Cisco and maintain a pretty close 8-5 work schedule and are highly productive; I know others that work seemingly all hours of the day and night. It's up to you, setting the level of expectation and how efficient you are. But it is extremely easy to get very wrapped up with work and leave little time for anything else."

Optical engineer,4.0,"Aug 5, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","- CISCO work culture is Open and inclusive.
Open: There are no barriers or inherent hierarchy that limits an employee from reaching out to peers or seniors. The culture encourages collaboration, learning and gives the employee a place to broaden their horizons in terms of theirs skills and knowledge.
Inclusive: CISCO believes in inclusive environment where everyone gets equal opportunity to grow and develop. It is not only inclusive in terms of people but also in terms of growth in recreational activities like sports and arts. It is quite difficult to find such a culture in other companies in India.
- Awesome benefits: The benefits provided by CISCO is by far the best that I have known. The benefits include Health coverage for Family (yourself, spouse, children and parents or in-laws). This is quite rare compared to other companies health benefits. Free GYM, periodic health checkups for yourself, family and parents. Extremely well maintained sports facilities for shuttle, cricket, volley ball and basketball and various others. It supports tuition fee refund for any education/course you take.
- Good Personal and Professional life balance: The work culture is flexible and allows the employee to maintain a balanced personal and professional life. Managers are very understanding and in general the management encourages the employee to ensure a good balance in work and personal life.",The hike and promotion cycle is fixed.

 - Clear limits are put in place to make sure that customers are fully supported when new products are introduced. I can't overstate how refreshing this was.","- Sales teams seem to be split into warring factions.

Everyone that wants to be a manager can become one. It doesn't matter if you'll be a good manager or not, if you want you just work your way out to it. And that's how you become a bad manager and end-up ruining a whole team :)

The problem is that we have lazy and poor managers, managing senior and high performing engineers.

By micro managing, tons of bureaucratic processes and lack of transparency makes the life of engineers frustrating and pretty damn boring.

But it's a matter of luck, I had one good manager, a so-so manager, and now a terrible manager, so good luck with that.

Was great until about 2003-4, but has slid downhill since.","Boxborough is full of dead wood. Most of the talented people have left or are itching to.
Zero balance between work and home life. It's 24/7 stress due to an oversized workload, undersized staff, and too many people who are mediocre at their jobs.
Fair or not, there's a perception from other locations that San Jose is full of people who get paid for doing very little. It's all who you know. For sure the company is dominated by the IOS group, none of whom seem to understand software developement.
Brain-dead stress on metrics is driving the company and leading to ridiculous behaviors...example: rating managers weekly on their bug counts, while concurrently outsourcing QA to a third party in India where workers performance is based on how many bugs they find: you can guess what happened.
Morale at Boxborough extremely low. Then corporate came up with the PULSE employee satisfaction survey and tied it back-door to managers' compensation. So now the managers are mad at the rank and file for being unhappy. I know one manager that actually made his people take the survey twice with an unsubtle threat that they'd better score ""happier"" next time."
Engineering manager,2.0,"Jan 6, 2015","Former employee, more than 8 years","Great benefits, very competitive salaries, wide range of directions available in a big company.  As a well established high-tech company Cisco attracts top talent with a great benefits package.  On the whole Cisco looks after its employees and provides good facilities.","Limited opportunity to innovate, corporate politics, demoralizing business model.  Being head-quartered in the USA, Cisco has a very American approach, and it is difficult to influence company direction or progress through the corporate ladder without spending time working in San Jose.  Working in the UK often means calls and conferences well into the evening, long hours, and a heavy impact on your personal-life.  The company acquires businesses with large market-shares and then implements cost savings, this results in missed opportunities to grow markets and innovate and a feeling of not being engaged with the market or end-customer."
Financial analyst - lift,5.0,"Oct 28, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","-The rotational aspect of the program is great in that you can experience 4 very different roles over the course of 2 years, which is great for trying to understand a company as large as Cisco. The variety of roles is clearly a plus as you are able to preference which areas interest you as you move throughout your time in the program.
-Generally, the expectations from your teams are within reason but provide a challenge at least in my experience. Learning is encouraged and mistakes are seen as an opportunity to grow rather than a reason for criticism.
-The program itself feels like a family of sorts that you can relate with people in the same boat as yourself early in career. This makes for a great support system and provides an automatic resource for general questions.","-Sometimes timing of role responsibilities and additional program expectations can overlap which can create a challenge; however, these are chances to exercise time management.
-Transitions can be a little tricky to manage due to turnover of roles (some new ones can be added and others) so some processes aren't as clearly defined. Generally business partners are understanding though and there's always help to get you up to speed."

Ever since Cisco has bought WebEx, there is a marked increase in the quality of upper management - in terms of their ability to aim big and execute. Best thing about WebEx - you do not have to pay for Web meetings - and online meetings are so effective to bring together geographically distributed teams.","Lack of respect for people and their personal life, and lack of professionalism (Especially within the product organization). 
WebEx culture can be described as somewhat chaotic. Disagreements / criticisms are discouraged - and the culture encourages people to rally around the Kool-aid of their bosses. Work-life balance is way tilted towards work, and the management takes it for granted. As an organization, WebEx tries to achieve more at the cost of quality of the product, and the quality of the life of the people who build the product.

Internally it can now be a very political environment where promotions and increases were awarded  to those who bought into empire building within business units and not people doing the real work essential to the success of the company. The focus on process and metrics is only effctive when everyone either agrees or is aware of the metric targets, without that it seems like evaluations are subjective and unfair.

Cisco had an HR department website instead of new-employee orientation.  Despite the steady stream of complaints from employees about the user hostility of the internal HR website, Cisco persisted in forcing its employees to rely on a highly unreliable internal HR website, much to the frustration of everyone involved.

Cisco management seemed hell-bent on working its employees days, nights, and weekends -- all the while chanting the Work-Life Balance buzzwords as hypocritical propaganda.

Other companies work hard to instill and encourage and maintain mutual respect so that each and every employee, from board room to mail room engage with kindness and respect.  Not Cisco.

Horrendous coffee."

Very good in terms of social presence (progressive, diverse), community engagement, social welfare, etc...  Large company with options to move around, grow, and gain experience. Salary/compensation tends to fall on the upper side of range. Large product/solution footprint that covers a lot of technology. 800lb gorilla with worldwide presence. Good reputation, Hallmark technology company, lots of things to build with and sell.","Big company with the classic downsides. Internal culture and drivers have been impacted over the last decade by rapid development and shareholder/profit pressures. Most innovation is now acquired and assimilated. Not so much a knock, but where the company is in its evolutional cycle. The result is constant fluctuation in strategy, priorities, organization, and management. Unfortunately, career advancement/survival these days too often is knowing what bandwagon to jump on, when to jump off, and when to blame someone else. Lot of hardworking talented people get flushed in the process with the regular LRs. Too many managers ""manage up"" and not down."
Solutions architect,2.0,"Oct 31, 2016",Current employee,"Flexible/home working, benefits. Work life balance.","Depending on what part of the company you work for then your working experiences are different. This is highly sales focussed company, Services are a poor relation and often driven with cost reductions. TAC are well funded thanks to lucrative support renewals. Cisco is far too US focussed, almost ALL the new VP's and SVP's are American, with American strategies which only work in the US. Cost reduction appears to be high on the agenda and this impacts all aspects for a number of years now. Morale is poor and the People Deal they published is farcical considering the number of layoffs they constantly keep making. Promotions have not been communicated or transparent for a long, long time. No clear or defined career ladder either, this depends on what accounts and projects you get attached to tbh. Cisco appears to be trying to regenerate into a more youthful company to reduce costs but have lost a tremendous amount of industry experience and skills in doing so. Innovation is primarily hardware focussed. Very poor long term strategy or investment in Services, where the financials take precedence over quality, efficiency and innovation. Remote workers are VERY remote, hardly getting to see colleagues at all for years. I never saw my Manager face to face for three years! Get used to days and days siting on Webex calls."

They kept doing re-orgs and rotated me under different managers. Each manager said I needed to establish myself with him. And each one promised me a promotion next year which didnt happen. I saw other people in other groups getting promoted or salary hiked much faster and here I am slogging under one manager after another, sometimes doing junk work that the technical leads themselves do not want to take. I stayed on because they gave me flexibility to work from home which I needed as I was facing some family issues. I looked outside and landed up with an offer that directly gave me a 45% hike. Happy to get out of here finally! I would not advise young people to join Cisco unless they know they are getting the right pay, the right recognition and growth in their careers. Each group is different, not every group need to be like mine. But move out as soon as you find out you are stagnating or you are not being just-fully rewarded/promoted, within 6 months."

In its effort to streamline operations, Cisco has made some aspects of working at Cisco very impersonal. For example, the use of Telepresence in some building lobbies means that you do not see a person in the lobby when you enter and exit the building.

If you are an account manager, you'll submit your forecast over the weekend, have some sort of large opportunity review at the beginning of the next and then do another forecast at the end of the week.  This leads many managers to micro-manage their teams.  Salary, as part of overall compensation package is below average. When you overachieve, you do well.

Webex meetings and teams, and our personal video devices make any remote worker feel like they're one cubicle over from anyone they need help from.  Hands down, a world class company to work for!","While work life balance is of utmost importance, it is easy to feel like you always have to be available.  Although, I would say that is more typically self-imposed as most folks hold themselves accountable for individual (and shared) success."
It engineer,4.0,"Sep 16, 2020","Current employee, more than 8 years","Always has a group of senior IT engineers and architects to ask questions to. They were always easy to approach and happy to answer questions and provide guidance (not sure if this is luck of the draw with their personalities, or if it is company/organization culture quite honestly).
Most of the managers are great people who provide guidance and try to help you determine your career path and put you on projects you would enjoy and your skills align to (there is always a ""bad apple"" manager, but this is the exception).","The IT side in particular seems to be following what I consider a negative trend in the industry of hiring contractors for specific projects with the skills needed, rather than training the full time employees they already have who have gotten the company to the successful state they are in. You won't get the best talent using primarily contractors and they will leave eventually. Then the company will lose their experience and knowledge after the project ends, when they could provide guidance towards a future project."

Senior marketing manager,3.0,"Jul 22, 2008",Former employee,"Pretty good IT system now I work in another IT company in Silicon Valley. 
Lots of on-line and in-person learning opportunities, the internal e-learning system make learning on technical and on-technical topics very easy. 
Also relatively easy moving from one group to the other, with no upside. 
I like John Chambers will meet with employees every month whose birthday falls into the month. Also he meet with new hires very regularly. 
Cisco shows consciousness on getting green and help the community. They have an extensive outreach program in which lots of volunteer opportunities are posted, encouraged and participated. Good job in there.","Only lateral movement moving from one group to the other, absolutely ridiculous policy. 
there should be really an incentive for people to move from one position to the other. 
I did an prestigious MBA program, then when I finish, there is absolutely no upside to move within Cisco. The HR did not find an easy way for me to find a new and exciting opportunity. So I left. 

Also, the salary review process. It really depends on your manager. If your manager likes you, you can get lots of money. If you are not the favorite, then you are out of luck."
Account manager,2.0,"Mar 11, 2009",Current employee,"The salary and compensation package are good. The company has an incredibly good reputation on the market (although once you are in the company and if it's not your first job, and you have known better companies, you wonder from where this reputation is coming). So it looks good on your CV.","No work-private life balance. You are supposed to be connected 24/7, also during your holidays, weekends, sickness leaves, evenings, etc... I have worked in other companies previously (international large companies as well within the ICT sector) so I can compare.
Also, there is no ""work hard and have fun"" spirit. No parties organized for the employees (OK now it's economic crisis but I understood Cisco was not that fun place to work before the crisis either). Nobody having a chat in the coffee corner - so hard everyone is occupied. The workload is huge. Everyone is doing a job that is meant easily for 2 people. At lunch everyone is talking excelusively about work.
I also feel that I learn nothing new compared to my previous jobs and that is not a positive sign.
The maddeness of the forecast: you have to do it sunday, wednesday and friday !"
Associate systems engineer,5.0,"Mar 15, 2011",Current employee,"Cisco is one of the best places that I've ever worked.  Even among other IT companies such as SAS and Google, I think Cisco stands out as one of the best.  (Okay, Google was really good too, and possibly cooler, but I still say Cisco is better.)

Why?  I can sum it up in one word: culture.  The people here are amazing, and always willing to help you out and help you grow in your career.  I've never loved the place and people I work with more.  It's also a very good place to build a career, with a lot of lateral movement within the company.  And if you're willing to work at it there is a lot of opportunity for advancement as well.  Just be prepared to work harder than anyone else if you want it.","The work/life balance is a little skewed towards the work side.  But they have seminars on just this topic.  It's not as crazy as Google, but I do spend more than 40 hours a week at work fairly often.  Luckily Cisco allows you to work from home, so you're not stuck in the office the entire time."
Software engineer,4.0,"Apr 6, 2011",Current employee,"The amount of information available internally to facilitate personal growth as a network engineer is amazing.  Cisco will foot the bill , provide resources internally for training, and recognition for for CCIE certification.  Additionally, you'll have the advantage of being able to work with some of the best engineers in networking within the entire industry and you'll be challenged to excel.  There aren't many opportunities in the entire country similar to working here.",The cost cutting and process oriented overhead have perhaps gotten a little too extreme and there's a bit of confusion as to which direction the company is headed.  Small perks such as soda's in the break room and home internet connection being payed for really gave a sense that the company still had a bit of its start up flair.  I think the dismantling of those programs while adding additional time consuming processes have had a detrimental effect on Cisco culture.

Product manager,3.0,"Aug 25, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years","Not sure anymore, but the ""Pros"" are getting fewer and fewer","Working at Cisco for 4 years now and just learning something disturbing that I didn't know before: Cisco policy mandates 15% of workers be rated as ""Needing Improvement"" during performance reviews. So you could do all your work successfully and excel and still labeled as ""Needs Improvement"". Even more disturbing is your performance review is not really 100% about your performance. It appears most weight for performance reviews is made by subjective opinions made from senior management within your group, even if you've never actually worked or interacted with this. Sound crazy that people you've never engaged with can effectively rate your performance? It is, but is acceptable within Cisco's corporate policy. What's really scary is who knows what subjective criteria is used in this opinion gathering process: Maybe you don't answer emails fast enough, maybe you have kids and others don't, maybe you're older that others, maybe you don't get the visible assignments? Who know but anything seems fair game. Worst of all, you can't challenge this..

Why is this concerning? In case you don't know, Cisco lays-off people regularly now - every year as a matter of fact. And, if you're rated as needing improvement (as mandated by corporate policy) you're guaranteed to be laid-off.

Cisco is a profitable company with ~$30B in the bank and yet forces people to be laid-off, go figure..."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Feb 5, 2015","Former employee, more than 5 years",I like the culture and the flexibility of the work environment. I loved working from home in my slippers.,"Working from home can limit your visibility within the company. I started at lower position that I should have thinking that once I was in the company I could explore other opportunities. Everywhere else I had worked I quickly moved up the ladder.  I soon found out that I was pigeon holed in that position. I was even willing to make a lateral move but could not do that.  I felt like I was between a rock and a hard place. This is especially the case for women and minorities. It is not impossible but you need to have a sponsor to grow. 

 If I had known that it would be so difficult to move into other positions. I would have waited for the right opportunity instead of taking the first one offered."

It can be frowned upon to take time off, or take time for learning, which results in most of the workforce woefully overworked and sadly behind the times in training. The cult of positivity is also very strong at Cisco, which makes trying to change processes or culture VERY difficult, any suggestion of change is usually taken personally and can result in active obstructionism to your goal."
Business finance manager,4.0,"May 15, 2018","Current employee, more than 10 years","Some great teams and management, great people and lots of flexibility.  Parts of the company will still make positions to fit their people rather than try to fit people into rigid job roles.  Flexible working hours are great.  Good people will generally accrue responsibility and be recognised.","Restructuring/layoffs are endemic, bringing constant attrition of people (good and bad) and low-level fear and malaise.  Many great teams have been turned into poor ones, with capable, experienced, helpful and flexible old-hands replaced with incapable, inexperienced, unhelpful and inflexible teams in low-cost locations.  This is not a criticism of the people, who can always be developed, but of the managers who try to automate their teams, removing any intelligence from the jobs and putting it into the tools and processes.  The result is people who are simply told what to do and how, meaning no personal responsibility, minimal personal growth and low motivation, plus when the tools or processes break (which is frequently) there is little capability to keep the business flowing.  Finally there are still too many teams with a lot of political grandstanding in the senior management--this is at best a nuisance and at worst can lead to poor decisions being taken by defocused management."

You can make good friends there and a lot of skilled and good engineers still work in TAC","The salary is 20% lower than the market - you can get more just across the fence at AON, ABB, Motorola and many others.

Do not expect to grow as an engineer there - mostly you will deal with platform specific bugs and defects in a very, very narrow field.

Do not expect to build a carrier - to get a higher grade is extremely hard. And it's all about showing your hard work and not about actually working hard (Visibility - as it called in all big companies).  

Do not expect a salary raise. Bargain straight from the beginning.  The raise is independent from your work and expertise, but rather from the stars in the sky.

Expect to be surrounded by fresh graduates, who will bombard you with stupid questions and will lower your value as an engineer because they will do the same job as you do for less money and you will educate them for free.

Working in TAC you will be the first to be hit - angry customers with problems will shout at you, sales will shout at you, because customers shout at them, your manager won't shout but will be on their side.

-	We have the flexibility to work from any place and adapt our time based on our objectives, this is not so evident in another company, we have the privilege to have this opportunity and trust.
-	My BU leaders are great by well communicating our imperatives, critical objectives, campaigns linked to Cisco transformation

- Salary is competitive
-In the Leaders in Finance & Technology rotation program, you get 4 different roles in finance over 2 years. This gives you good exposure to finance leadership and provides 4 different experiences. Good relationships with your LIFT class, some leadership opportunities within the program like leading meetings etc","All the downsides are for LIFT, not necessarily Cisco

-Short rotations of 6 months don't let you get a deep dive into some roles, the managers don't want to train you a lot if you're leaving in a couple months, so you take on trivial tasks. This makes you pretty much a glorified intern for each team you're on, not a true financial analyst.
-The manager for LIFT controls your bonuses, rotations in the program etc. and you rarely ever get contact with her. There is a big communication disconnect.
-Morale is low in the program. A lot of the people dread all the LIFT meetings and are not that excited for things.
-A lot of the roles only provide you with about 15-20 hours of real work each week. A lot of downtime in most roles."

Most managers are not into micro-management and there is opportunity for job rotation so that people do not get stagnated doing the same thing over and over. Works through consensus building and allows grass root proposals to move for action. Moves decisively, once decisions are made but decision making is a long drawn out process. Margins are still rather high even though the revenue growth has stagnated.","The size of Cisco does not allow it to be nimble. Decision making requires many layers of socialization and corporate politics becomes a barrier to being able to be nimble. So instead of figuring out how to do the next big thing, there are many many hours wasted on agreeing on what is the next big thing. Unnecessary complexity is built into the working of the company and finding the right point of contact to get a question answered is a feat in itself. There is also a sense of people taking no accountability for the business outcomes and only for their own tasks. Lately, the organization has become a bit risk averse - so big bold moves are very difficult to make. Promotion, recognition and growth at the lower levels are based on performance but as we move into middle and upper management, it is very obvious that it is handed to people who know the movers and shakers."

Their work at home policy for many jobs are pretty good and offers max productivity for employees.

The other managers Cisco hire as middle managers are NCE's. Just because he is a good technician does not mean he is a good manager CISCO!! This is where the challenges lie. 9/10 strategies are built on ppt charts that go nowhere. Cisco is a military Institution of managers.

Internal career opportunities get slimmer as you climb up the ladder and there is no transparency over internal hiring decisions.

Software engineer iv,4.0,"Jun 12, 2008",Current employee,"You get tremendous information out there inside Cisco Systems about processes, technology and ideas. You only can get benefited because of this wealth of knowledge. The overall compensation and benefits is one of the best in the industry. Cisco is one place where there are all sorts of career opportunities on offer and they actually encourage you to move around and increase the breadth of your experience and skills. There are mechanisms in place to immediately reward employees for any kind of outstanding performance so even as a big company that keeps motivated and devoted in solving the problems at hand during crisis situation",They make the same mistake as every other large company in that they tie performance and career development feedback with the monetary benefits. So it naturally results in the performance feedback influenced by the amount of money available to any team in that year's budget. There is too much of middle level management who have gone there just because they stuck with the company and not necessarily because of leadership skills and that shows up in how they lead. Cisco has this notorious habit of not bringing middle level management from outside. They should atleast balance internal promotions with bringing fresh leadership from outside
Senior project manager,3.0,"Jan 15, 2013","Current employee, more than 5 years",Good benefits and access to a lot of amenities!!  Some groups have a autonomy and work great.

Some have none at all :(  Senior leadership at the director level change every 8-12 months consistently and have done so for the past few years.  Goals and direction changes just as often.

- They used to want you to have a 65% customer facing, now it is close to 90%.
- Terrible tools to work with, and especially exposing customer to it, frustrates everyone.
- No trainings being offered. We have internal trainings available but management dont give you the time to do it since they expect you to be almost 100% customer facing.
- Bonuses are being cut off all the time.
- Benefits are being cut.
- Frequent management reorganization is distractive.
- Everyone is trying to save their job so there are not many enabler managers.
- Layoffs every 6 months and outsourcing jobs to 3rd party contractors offshore.

Recruiter,5.0,"Apr 5, 2018","Current employee, more than 1 year","My entrance into Cisco was through the HRUP program. HRUP is the best rotational program I've come across (internally to Cisco and externally). If you are a junior in college, interested in HR, go apply for the internship now! Outside of great pay, great company brand, and awesome co-workers, you are given the opportunity to explore ANY area of HR when you come on full-time. With buy-in from our CHRO, you get to explore five different areas of HR (including the internship). I have loved my time in the HRUP program, and am now in my final rotation. I would highly recommend it. It's been the BEST foundation for my career moving forward.

I'm currently recruiting for Cisco and it is incredible. The brand name gives you such access to awesome talent. Candidates ALWAYS say ""It's Cisco!"" when I ask them why they are interested. It's so easy to be passionate about Cisco and sell working here because it really is incredible.","There are pockets of cynics who are annoying. ""What do you expect. It's Cisco"". They bug me. There is a lot of change, so, if you like structure, stand back. Sometimes I miss words amongst all the acronyms we speak. Some of the buildings still look like it's the 90s, but they are slowly getting renovated. It just always seems like my building is last."

Senior marketing manager,4.0,"Jun 13, 2008",Current employee,"Compared with many other hi-tech companies, Cisco values collaboration and cross-functional group work more.  Cisco's leadership team understands the need to provide employees with work life balance and flexible hours.  For the most part, Sr. leaders respect employees and you do see a level of openess regardless of ranks or titles.  The fact that Cisco is a global leader in networking also helps attract good people for the most part. The benefits and compensation are competitive enough and due to it's location in CA and the average age of the employees, there is a level of maturity and inclusiveness and diversity inside the company.","The functional structure of the company results in some inefficiencies in the system and often times it takes a lot of time to get consensus from all key stakeholder teams before a decision can be made and by that time the market situation may have changed and customer needs may have shifted.  Ultimately it potentially makes the company less competitive.  The caliber of the employees is not very consistent.  There are lots of deadweight, folks who've been around for too long and only here for a paycheck and for what they can get from the company vs. trying to do their best to help customers and innovate"
"Senior manager, product management",5.0,"May 31, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","Cisco is a great company, it empowers and give employees the freedom to deliver to their full potential. It is a company that is constantly looking for excellence.
It is a great diverse place. As Hispanic/Latino, I feel my unique values are not only welcome but even encouraged. It is a true global company. I am part of Conexión, Cisco's Hispanic/Latino ERO, We help Cisco to hire and retain the best Latino talent as well as helping the Latino Community at Cisco and in our neighborhoods. 
As a large and successful corporation, benefits are very good and employees are given the necessary resources to succeed. We work on the newest technologies, with modern processes that help Cisco (and us as employees) to stay ahead of the curve!","Change is always good, but sometimes there are collateral impacts of the way Corporate America is handled, basically with a clock that shakes every quarter. Cisco being a large corporation is no exempt from that, with constant role and leadership changes as well as more than desired limited restructurings. This might affect your career if you don't know how to deal with constant change."

And trivial customer issues are communicated to manager as critical issues and engineers are rewarded for that with promotions and cisco spark awards.  The more junk stuff one talks in meetings, the more eligible is he for promotion. Speak non sense and ask same questions in all meetings and one gets visibility for that. And with that visibility promotions are decided.  

Engineer has to go through emotional trauma when he is given bottom 10% or bottom 5% rating. 

If one isnt communicating with manager well, give him bottom 10%. An engineer from every team has to be in bottom 10% every year.  This is absolute non-sense.

The company is at the cutting edge of many areas of IT/Telecomms and is still highly respected as a good employer so is well regarded on your CV.","Every year the decline in our core products, switching and to a lesser extent routing, means the company has to work harder and in more areas to try to make up for the lost business and show some growth.  The company has to work harder on more and more smaller opportunities with more varied technologies/solutions and business models.

Need automation within the organization especially in HR. If you say you are innovative, bring automation into the organization. This can be a cost saving at the end of the day but the company needs to be willing to make the investment upfront. The compensation programs need improvement so it can reach 100% of the workforce and not a small percentage.

Have strong feelings about whether XML is really a good interface between cross-domain components?  Find the right BU that is working on the technology, and a manager or tech lead who is open to ideas, and the opportunity is there.

If the BU is led by non-visionary or agenda-driven people who are not open to change, then this will just be another job.

Every big company has its faults but Cisco is a great company to work for if you want to start your career on the right foot.  Having a reputable name like Cisco behind you will always take you places.  depending on your manager, an employee can experience autonomy and job stability.

Also another great perk is that I work from home and never come into the office because my team is global.  I have the Cisco ECT/IP phone installed in my home office and I no longer need to be at my desk.  This is a huge perk because I save in gas and carbon emissions.","The worst comment I have about Cisco is its ability to give promotions and raises.  I've been at the company for 5 years and I've never been promoted.  They give me small raises here and there but this year, they no longer give out stock options.

Every year IC's expected to do more with less.  Upper management disconnected with the lower ranks, making a Managers job extremely difficult with limited tools to develop and motivate teams.

- Sales Kick-Off in Vegas","- Product: Working for Webex felt like you were part of a marketing hoax by Cisco, there is barely any integration to other business units and the revenue contributed to the overall revenue is only marginal, which leads to you not being taken seriously unless you are working on big deployments. 

- Management: There is no leadership in the UK. Fear-mongering and a passive aggressive attitude in team/individual meetings add to a strange and dampened atmosphere. (!) If the Software/Cloud Sales Lead calls himself ""the Supreme Leader"", then take this seriously, as its meaning is conveyed in his management style. Middle Management, many without any prior experience, is a mouthpiece of upper management. 

- Work Environment: Sadly, the environment is toxic and there is no sense of team atmosphere. There is an obvious segregation amongst team members. Multiple people have been fired in the past. 

- Compensation: Average to below average if you live in London. 

- Career Progression: No career progression (!). ""Senior"" positions are created for doing the same job and for little extra pay, you have no options to progress further unless you move to a different business unit, which some were able to do. 

- Location: You will be based in Feltham and you will not be allowed to work remotely (but it's Webex, right?) or in the City (unless it is an emergency or other circumstances)."

Software engineer,4.0,"Jun 18, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco has great compensation. I second what others say about how in Cisco, there are always opportunities for you to prove yourself. There is always enough work for you if you want to try new projects and and work harder, in order to get your name out and move move upwards.

Another major plus is the lower management. They tend to hire people from within the current ranks, and therefore they hire people who have gone through the motions and know what its like to be a lower level employee.

Compensation is also good, including bonuses and monetary rewards. yeah.","One thing that always makes me annoyed by cisco is the cubicles that are pale-puke green and sick-of-my-life grey. This seems to also be the theme with the exterior of the buildings. Also lining the walls of the interior of the buildings are really old pictures to -i guess- spice things up visually, but they are faded out now so are kind of depressing to look at. sometimes I find myself just not wanting to be inside those buildings, so work from home.

Honestly, all they have to do is every once in a blue moon add a new picture to the wall, and it would make a world of difference. I saw the other day they were painting one of the walls orange. That made a HUGE difference in that area."

A lot depends on the BU you are in. There is huge hierarchy and a lot of redundancy in management.  Since the last 2 years, there is yearly restructuring of BUs, yearly layoffs impact productivity. Many of lower grade employees tend to leave within a year or 2. At higher grades, people get entrenched in their roles and there is no scope for growth. Hikes have been absent for 2 years. Bonus is delayed by 6 months and not likely to paid in full this year.

Pressure from SDN providers is going to impact core business.  Sales comp plans built on pushing 1 time hw/sw sales (instead of monthly recurring revenue) is counterproductive to future growth.  Always on mentality....there is SO much work to do, the only way to stay on top of the workload/mtgs/reporting expectations is to work 11-13 hours per day.

"Compensation, benefits and job analysis specialist",5.0,"Apr 5, 2018","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco enables an industry leading work/life flex. Cisco's hierarchical structure feels very flat and is incredibly symbiotic. Company culture isn't harsh, but encouraging and friendly. It's all about development--focusing on the team and specifically the positive and building relationship you should have with your manager. Those who are ambitious, work hard, and genuinely network will be recognized for their efforts and will be rewarded with great work opportunities. Cisco espouses the principle that in joining this one company, you can have multiple careers. Cisco can scale talent due to their collaborative technology--enabling us to hire top talent across the globe making Cisco a very diverse and culturally enriching environment.","Business functions can be siloed from one another. Not always an apparent information share between functions. Building bridges and tearing down walls can be arduous and time consuming. There is a lot of red tape, and it's not uncommon to deal with work that, in principle, should move very quickly but is slowed down because teams can be scattered across the global with different timezones. Cisco's culture of ""let's create a formal meeting"" in order to get work done isn't efficient, and it's hard to be a change agent in a team that has a culture of working to solve problems by creating formal meeting after formal meeting."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Sep 7, 2018",Current employee,Get to work on latest technologies,"-- The executive leadership say all the right things during internal all-hands meetings to make employees feel optimistic. But somehow, things don't seem to be executed to the bottom level. 
-- Directors reporting to directors and VPs reporting to VPs and some of these directors/VPs don't even have a team under them. Not sure why we need so many directors and VPs when we are not allowed to bring in skilled employees who can really contribute to the work. Excellent and and hardworking contractors eventually move out when another company is willing to bring them in as employees. And Cisco ends up losing productivity by having to search for and train another contractor. Happens over and over again
-- When the company got a huge windfall from President Trump's corporate tax cut, employees were hoping we get to share some of that. Alas, the money was used for stock buy-back. Obviously, those holding large number of Cisco stock benefited the most. And guess who are the people who hold the largest amount of stock who enjoyed that windfall? Any special, one-time bonus or salary adjustment for employees to share some of that? Zilch."

You get salary on time.","There are several cons. Where should I start !!

Don't go with the ""Best place to work"" - tag.

1. Project is not that good. Most of them using legacy technology. Lot of unnecessary process to do a simple job. Do the process related jobs, they also use legacy tools.

2. There are lot of people to do the same kind job . So no good practices are being followed. Different people followed different practices.

3. Build process takes 6-7 hrs to complete and with manual trigger. So you can think how much precious development time is being lost.

4. Not much of innovation happens here . So learning new thing as per market standard - you can forget about this.

5. Everything depends on your manager. Even the company don't provide relocation benefit if you are moving to new state for the job. Everything has to be pre approved. So please read your offer letter carefully. Where in most of the company its is part of company policy, here it depends on your manager and BU.

6. Managers are not supportive at all. Even when the company has no strict work from office policy, the manager forces you to come to office. So dont know whats going on here. In the orientation they say - We dont have any rules, but in reality its something else.

7. There is no growth opportunity.

8. Think twice before joining this company. Its better to work in small company rather than working here."

Very vague promotions criteria.  Differs from manager to manager, largely because there isn't one and it is basically up to your manager's personal opinion and standard and their power in the organization.  

No rocking the boat allowed.  If you see inefficiency, go along with it otherwise you'll get negative comments in your 360 review for being difficult and hard to work with.  You'll see a lot of chasing around the tails on some very straightforward questions as a result.  

Concensus driven decisions and no true leader will drag on projects for a very long time and dissolve at some point without warning.

Pay and incentive is NOT based on performance.  Bell curve is used and even with performance evaluation, most people get the same bonus.  This discourages and frustrates high performers but is a haven for those who can adapt and just cruise on mediocracy."

Senior business analyst,4.0,"Dec 7, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year",Great working atmosphere. Awesome culture. Lots of freedom. You can make a long career if you want and fit the culture. Lots of learning opportunities. 8 hours (minimum) per quarter to spend in training.  You can spend 8 hours per year on volunteering.  Woking from home options. Performance based on results.,"Too much freedom could demotivate people who do not fit that style. Certain organisations are rotten in bad decision making by leadership and middle management drawing employees to adapt to significant amounts of change, new ""strategies"" of new leadership.  Massive layoffs in the US have lead to backfilling positions in other countries by junior pepole.  Sometimes management expets the same performance. Which is good for learning and interacting at a higher level, but gets you to work harder to perfore well and get promoted. It is possible, you just need to work very hard for it. Too many people with remote managers are left out on their own."

The next week the group VP said focus on time to market not quality, the exact opposite. You tend to get siloed and management does not seem able to figure out get workers access to the numerous training programs or worse this lack of access is intentional. Tell your manager to figure out how to get access to ""Chuck"" bucks for training. Intergroup working relationships can be difficult probably due to the Cisco HR stacked ranking mechanism. People do not want to help out when integrating different products/functionality together. Definite ageism in labor reduction practices. Buy other companies then start killing the product even when still achieving 20% growth. I'm sure the tier 1 telco's are going to be happy about that."

employees buttering their managers got promotions and higher bonuses even if they are not doing anything throughout the year which is culture adopted due to higher presence of people from India where this is pretty common.

outsourcing of jobs to India which is on rise as Cisco is cutting jobs from here and hiring folks heavily in Bangalore India which is not a healthy trend and it was tried and failed in some groups in past. Some groups do not even have any USA employee presence and they are totally located in India while dev team is located here which caused latency in progress but since Indian lobby is pretty strong in Cisco they are able to save their jobs easily and rule the company.

*  Annual layoffs.  The behavior and performance problems are long gone and the people now getting laid off are bad fits for their organization.  Why are they bad fits?  Usually because of a prior botched reorganization that was poorly thought out
*  You will be reorganized every 3 to 5 quarters.  Expect it"

Lot of engineers with mediocre talent perhaps the budget dictates the quality of people. Bureaucracy & process bogs down everything. First skill you should need is politics and how to derail others work.

Cisco internal Pulse employee survey meant to get candid feedback about their boss / management & Cisco. But  it is one big phony trick, you will forced to give a positive feedback abt boss & senior management, if not you will have to face the same consequence on performance review, because the management will indirectly warm you that they have a mechanism to identify what the individuals response are.

We are developing a product for past 4-5 years under the excuse that the customers absolutely rely on it for their day to day network operations, but in fact there is only a handful of actual users using the system out of 1000's of projected users, and we haven't even added any net new features for more than past 2 years with 20+ team just doing bug fixes, because the code & standards are so poor. There is not much respect/value for engineering, which leads to high attrition, it is like a revolving door. I have seen more than 25 people come join & leave in my team alone...

1. A very well oiled machine with complete life cycle of product development is present in India.
2. Expertise available in all areas which is fantastics for career growth.
3. A very competitive work place where fairly low percentage of people can take their position for granted.
4. Cisco pays bonus in better than reasonable way, usually close or above promise. Never betrays on that.
5. Work place resources (non-software) are best in the world, yes best in the world. Ex. fantastic transport,work place environment, furnitures, gardens, cafeteria.
6. Better than average software tools but not world class. However, cisco keeps improving. This makes a life little easier.
7. Reasonable work life balance with burst of high pressure cases.
8. High focus on customer delivery.
9. reasonable rewards (360 degree)","Here are the cons
1. Opaque performance appraisal
2. India management is still under US Management and is unable to take directions on its own, typically gets dictated by US management at the cost of Indian teams efforts. Need to be self empowered and take up Products all by itself. Many product successes and significant talent available to become self-reliant.
3. Below par salary levels, causing attrition of good talent."

If you happen to do your job and work hard and manager doesn't like you for any reason, then managers can abuse power and you end up in list for next layoff. My Engineering team was technically OK but I have seen stronger teams. The ASIC methodology was not good enough and found it difficult to fix as my manager was not open to improvement. It was little support for internal IP although useage of internal IP encouraged. I managed to reengineer and manage to do my job but found the process to be inefficient. Even junior engineers are trained to think more in terms of busineess (compare with other places which are engineering focused). Cisco is combination of startups and that's a factor in their internal politics. I also had to login and work in weekends because my manager did the same."

Cisco is confused elephant now. Unsure what it wants to do. Networking or Small Cell or Cloud or Data Center or Smart City or IoT. Many other company failed in past and re-focused on what they do best. Wants to become #1 IT company but using only networking product, yet doing all stuff.

For it employee are mere commodities. Does not have any emotional attitudes towards them. It is flexible bcos most team at world wide so you will be on call most of time and rest in lab. Indians engineers spoil their personal life and become 24*7 slave if they can not handle it smartly.

- Overall, Cisco seems to have generally nice people
- Certain items such as its core values (ethics, frugality) are pushed downward quite effectively
- Cisco shines in sales and channels","- Cisco has a long way to go in terms of effective product delivery (including product management and engineering). Too often, it must acquire in order to enter new markets.
- Product cycles are too long (1-2 yrs on average from concept to FCS)
- Brain-drain (outward)
- Too bureaucratic in terms of career growth, ownership of efforts, accountability
- When one can get higher compensation, more responsibility/authority/accountability, better title at other technology companies, one has to wonder what true advantage there is to stay at Cisco
- Too many ""lifers"" coasting"
Senior project manager,5.0,"Sep 16, 2008",Current employee,"Judged on how well you perform, not the hours you work. The total rewards package is well rounded. Stock, base pay, and vacation time are all very accomodating. People are expected to perform and not required to come in to the office unless needed. There is extreme flexibility to work from wherever. The company respects their employees and encourages everyone to develop themselves in both experiences and formal education. Customers generally have a high level of respect for the services teams which makes project that more enjoyable to manage. Senior management has always been very respecful of the worlk/personal life balance.","Accounts are silo oriented. This means that when one does well on an account, the are very often only working on one account. So, the recognition does not always leave that particular acocunt team. It is also very flexible in allowing one to work from wherever, but on the other side, one needs to be in the office to get promoted. Promotions are very hard to come by and raises are not given unless one goes through a long, grueling process. Senior management needs to do a much better job of connecting performance to monetary rewards. Most of the time, one wonders why people get promoted."

I came here from the public sector and I expected much quicker decision making on key issues. Management in my organization does not always communicate effectively how their decisions will impact their staff down the line. Large contingent work force.

We talk a lot about our  People Deal and how each employee matters but it feels like it is really The Some People Deal, depending on who you know.

- Friendly work from home policies
- Great people","When I started at Cisco, they were still doing the free drinks, free food, and beer parties on Friday. That went away as soon as the downturn started, and then the layoffs began shortly thereafter. The first couple of years they laid off the bad people, and then there weren't any bad people left, so they just started flailing the axe at random. Every year around late summer, it swings again, so everyone is just sitting in dread waiting to see who goes. Then, afterwards, you have to try to figure out how to get things done when important pieces of your team aren't there anymore. 

It's still an okay place to work, and the people who are left below upper management are all great. I wouldn't tell you not to take a job there, but be aware that you're going to spend every summer wondering whether you'll have a job in the fall."

They have pushed the back to work plan every month since June. If you like working from home, Cisco is the place for you.

Everything peripheral to the business is social justice oriented. Again, if that's your thing, Cisco is the place for you. You cant buy a notepad in the company store without being hit over the head about how part of the proceeds go to a social justice initiative. I'd rather my workplace be apolitical.

Little to no training. There is very much a, ""Welcome to Cisco, here is a list of names of people who you might need to know. Figure it out. But feel free to ask questions."", attitude that is being addressed, but it's still a thing.

I've been here for a year now and I haven't even had a performance review. So, if I'm doing a good job, I don't know it. If I'm not, I don't know it. And if either of those things are the case, I don't know how to keep doing well or how to do better. I'm still figuring it out."

Problem is at the upper level, hundreds of old-timers are clogging the promotion path by protecting each other and sticking around until all their options are vested. There are very few managers promoted to director and above as at these levels, hiring is often from outside. Budget for raise and promotions are always limited whether its good years or bad years. This is forcing management to give raise or promotion to 10% of those who deserve it. The attrition rate is low so they are not trying to identify why people are leaving, HR thinks everything they do is right and are not trying to improve things, except with they screw up like when they reduced everyon'e bonus by 5% which impacted most the junior employees who dropper from 17% to 12% while VPs went from 100% to 95%."

Even if you do promote yourself year round, you can still forget about a salary increase. Don't even mention stock options/rsu's, those are reserved mainly for execs.

- Any perks that we used to have mostly have been eliminated. We still get free coffee and hot tea.
- Health benefits are being cut back yearly it seems.
- US engineering jobs are being outsourced to china and india on an ongoing basis. Coupled with the lack of career advancement, this creates a huge moral problem.
- Ridiculous work hours expected. It used to be somewhat worth it to work long hours when there were stock options and salary increases. Now, I find myself and others working less and less after hours. And any overtime hours worked are mostly unrewarded. It's not uncommon to work day and night for several weeks and receive a $500 cap award if you're lucky. Sometimes, it's $0.

but at the same time has lost focus on its core switching and routing markets, falling behind 
competition in getting new products to market. Cisco is trying to address this problem with ""spin-ins"" where selected engineers are promised millions of dollars in stock options to join a startup 
that develops a next generation switch that Cisco subsequently acquires. The irony is 
that Cisco could and should be developing these next generation products internally 
instead of farming the work out to people who leave the Company and then come back,
while making millions of dollars in the process. This has an extremely demoralizing effect 
on the engineers that were left behind whose projects were cancelled because the message
to them is either the Company is so disorganized that it cannot develop its next generation
products internally or that the existing engineering teams are not good enough to do it.
Either way it is hard to imagine a more negative internal message to motivate folks."

Decent salaries and great bonus program.","Hard to move up because of constant acquisitions (acquisitions always include more senior talent)
Hard to innovate because of constant acquisitions (typically buys into new technology/products/markets rather than developing from within)  
Too much internal competition - there always seem to be at least 3 groups duplicating whatever you are doing - creating lots of dead ends and uncertainty - are you on the winning team or just spinning your wheels until the next re-org or the next round of layoffs?
Engineering jobs are being sent overseas - strictly based on financials.  Workforce globalization is eroding opportunities in the US.
Global teams and lack of appreciation for time zones create massive communication inefficiencies
 - Forget about work life balance as global teams and round the clock video conferencing occupy more of your early mornings and late nights.
 - Expect to have hundreds of emails waiting for you every morning

Innovative tools - one of the best things is that we get to use what we sell (especially collaboration tools) that makes our jobs more productive and engaging.

Activities within and outside the office - many volunteering and sports activities that are not only fun, but also very helpful in terms of getting to know your team mates and other people working at Cisco.

Telecomuting perks are great as long as you are able to get into a remote situation. A lot of freedom in the way you organize your work day but it really depends of the group you are in.,"Does not stand up to its motto: We revolutionized the way we work, live and play as working from remote locations will be discouraged! Feeling of not being able to make a difference. Very cliquish environment. Experience at Cisco can vary wildly from one group to another as each group has its own style. Very hard to get promoted beyond the middle management level. Competing groups have their own agendas which sometimes run counter-current to your responsibilities. Upper management is very quick in forming opinions about personnel and these opinions are very hard to change once formed. often hard to get things done. Also, having stock options for the last 10 years has been useless at Cisco since it has been underwater ever since."

2) Resources are plenty, there are so many great minds, books, e-material, routers, simulators where you get to learn whatever you yearn to 
3) Around 80% of the colleagues share their learnings/knowledge with each other","However there are some downsides which can be improved
1) Priorities keep changing especially when you are growing. Every morning, You prepare yourself for what to do that day, but top mgmt asks for some other urgent data and ur entire plan for the day is screwed up. The next morning you will not prepare for anything
2) Productive time to learn or explore something is slowly getting replaced with too many meetings/ updates. 1 hr of everyday update in one forum is far better than updating the same status in multiple forums, meetings, mails and debating over it
3) As a result of 2), our actual productivity happens during the family time which results in improper work-life balance -> sleeplessness ->frustration ->  less energy/enthusiasm to explore new things"

The company has built an amazing infrastructure that allows work to be done very smoothly.  The linkages between functions is mature and well thought out, like the partnership with HR, the support from IT, etc.  Cisco still has a great business, which means it has enough money to fund efforts so that they can be done right rather than shoe-stringing things together and not getting the outcomes that are possible.",There are a lot of people at Cisco today that are managing their careers rather than their business.  The environment has become much more political after 2001 and you have to be careful of people's intent.  One of the more interesting cultural outgrowths of the increased politicization is that people are reluctant or unwilling to help others.  They are intensely focused on promoting and positioning themselves without concern for growing and building teams and peers.

Great benefits.","Cisco is big and the typical challenges exist - tons of process and overhead. It really can stifle innovation and agility. However, it's a business that is very much about the bottom line. The best product managers and leaders are the ones that can translate a vision into a story of revenue and market share, which is kind of the cornerstone of a business like Cisco. Given it's size and background, Cisco's culture is more rigid than most of the new Silicon Valley big boys.

In HR you are treated like a true professional. As long as you're performing at an acceptable level, no one pays attention to or cares where, when, and how you get your work done.

2. Its a place where you feel valued everyday and know that your work matters.
3. A whole ecosystem of support to help you anytime.

Easy to do minimal work and stay employed for many years.","Little chance for advancement, many vicious self-promoting middle management who lead with fear. HR is useless of course, and upper mgmt is too stupid to see what's going on. Last many years have gone way over board hiring undergrads who many of which have contributed nothing after 2-3 years. I know a few who are great, but most get by on being cute and perky, while the long term employees are forced to cover. 

Annual layoffs mostly hit those who do the most work, while middle management stays fat. Reorgs are done on a regular basis just because. If the current structure was so great last year why have yet another reorg?

I've been moved 10 times between teams often even my own manager didn't know about it. No one asks if you want to move to that team, or if your skills are what is needed. We're just numbers."

* Great culture at a company level and everyone is valued.","Having written all the pros and many more to follow, there is a con to all the pros and this is primarily because of the leadership, which believes in seeing everything started and completed on presentations and the actual execution is lost. Lot of focus on visibility aspect without actually looking at the ground level execution. Lot of opportunities are lost as the leadership level is only busy in showing accomplishments with very little to no focus on individuals growth. If you are one of those who knows how to get the limelight, you are certainly bound to grow but if you are more of doing the actual task, you are dependent upon your leaders.

We initially had really good dynamic, and for a period of time I really enjoyed my day to day. Over time, we had a series of leadership changes, acquisitions, and after nearly a dozen manager changes in a few short years and an exodus of talent, my team became a shell of what it formerly was. I had great experiences finding other ways to involve myself in the Cisco community that led to a lot of amazing new connections and opportunities that I will forever be grateful for.

Cisco sent an email to all employees threatening termination in late October if you were not vaccinated or pursing an accommodation. For those that requested an accommodation, 6 months have gone by with no update. Other large tech companies have dropped this mandate but not Cisco. 
A company that focuses so heavily driving an inclusive future for all, seems to completely omit those who have medical conditions, personal beliefs, etc that derive from the narrative. 
There seems to be only one acceptable way of thinking (politically, socially) at Cisco.

Good employees tend to get frustrated and rotate out of their current role or leave, which creates knowledge gaps within the group.

- The company still goes through an annual layoff cycle.  Good people with lots of years with the company are usually let go without the opportunity to find another position internally.

They had to lay off over 6500 people and I don't think they really knew how to do that.  It seemed as if they kept all of the people with a 10% or lower and got rid of all of the people with a 10% or higher on their performance.  Upper management never spoke to the right people.

Whenever my kids are sick, or I had to take them to an appointment, my team always had my back. This is the main reason why I am at Cisco - this employer will make sure men and women can have exciting opportunities at work WHILE being a parent.

Middle management is real hell and they are afraid of their own shadows.
Impossible to be promoted, unless you drop everything your doing and appease your director by chasing the shiny ball.

The people are interesting and smart, the environment is electrifying, and it is a company that has made a tremendous impact in the way people live, work, and play! There are some really good pockets to work in within the company, and you really have to seek those out. And I think that's about it  It has been quite an experience, and one I shall never forget!","Ageism with no recourse.
Impotent human resources managers who don't want to deal with problematic senior managers.
Senior level people hiring their friends for critical positions, and the friends are incompetent.
Excessive politics.
Burdensome bureaucracy leading to a lack of agility--inability to get done what could be done.
TAP (talent assessment process) in which competent employees are rated poorly for political reasons--I can't tell you how many times I have seen the competent employee let go in the quarterly purge, while the mediocre, non-threatening employee remains in place and is rewarded.
An Asian VP who promoted every Asian on our large team before moving on to a new position.
Reorganizations to cover up failures."
Senior manager,3.0,"Jul 16, 2015","Former employee, more than 10 years",Excellent benefits and caring (if something catastrophic happens) that are worth staying for - to a point. Smart people doing some excellent work. Need to drive your own career - important to change roles every few years to keep your resume fresh. Good for earlier career folks - 5-7 years experience. Staying too long in one group/role is dangerous to your future prospects outside Cisco. Hopeful that Chuck coming on as CEO will breathe new life into the organization.,"Due to the bloating of the organization, groups are forced to narrowly define what they do - leading to many groups have reduced scope and decision making/visibility is kept at the very top. Growth has not kept up and top people need to move on for others to have an opportunity to move up, but even then many times the succession plan is already laid. Leaders are often politically motivated to do what's best for them/their group vs. the company. Lots of group-think, not willing to speak plainly about issues."
Software development engineer (sde),4.0,"Oct 14, 2022","Former employee, more than 1 year","Pro's They're well made, reliable, and tend to function for a very long time without going down. Well supported--it's very easy to find documentation on how to do something, or a company/person who can do whatever it is you want done for you. Very large feature set. Cisco offers numerous open standard and proprietary protocols and options in their code that other vendors lack parity with. Stable code and quick bug fixes. Bugs that cause major operational or security problems have been extremely rare, in my experience. Most products have a CLI that is easy to use and understand.","Con's Price. Sometimes I think Cisco should be spelled Ci$co. Complex licensing. One could invest as much time learning their licensing schemes as you would studying for a CCIE. Inconsistencies between products. Cisco has acquired numerous companies and incorporated their products into Cisco's portfolio while retaining much of the code base--this leads to many quirks when working in the CLI's on multiple products. Most GUI software is written in Java and can do a lot of dumb things--specifically the ADSM software used to configure ASA's. Occasional interoperability issues when connecting to products from other vendors. Software releases can be a bit confusing, as figuring out which features you're getting is not always clear."
Software engineer,3.0,"Jan 14, 2011",Former employee,"good brand name

if inquisitive enough can learn a lot about markets, products , technical architecture in general","Too much politics. 
Appreciation by mouth isnt good enough and thats what you get from higher up
. Need to play politics and keep whining or threatening about leaving, you might get something then. Being new to work full time didnt play my cards well and kept to myself.

Lot of guys know nothing but talk and eventually they take the pie and you are left with crumbs.

As a new hire fresh off the school and under choice it is fun. Fast forward a year, you see you havent done anything to be proud of. It strikes to you , you knew much more when you were in school than now. You were much more marketable before than now!!
Advice: learn as much as you can , once you see its slowing down , get out before you become totally unemployable!!"

- Great food","At Company level

- Big variation in salaries for same grade
- No transparent appraisal/promotion process
- No proper feedback loop from engineers to skip-level managers

- G8 and G10 are eligible for RSU component in their pay, but rarely get it.

At Personal level

- Career growth *entirely* depends on the manager you report to.
- All concern/feedback stop with your reporting manager. No clear path for escalation
- How we get raise in salary or job grade is opaque and often just the opinion of our manager 
- HR redirects all queries back to manager
- Politics and growth is controlled/supported by directors/mangers

Partner account manager,3.0,"Sep 24, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","One of the best things about working at Cisco is the friendships you make along the way. I had the opportunity to be part of a Cisco Sales Associate Program when I first joined Cisco. This program was a yearlong, worked alongside 50 other CSAPers from different countries and had 3 months intensive training followed by 9 months on-the-job training, working remotely with virtual teams.

The wealth of experience I gathered on the job is extensive. Asides from being knee-deep in the technology and sales of that technology, I worked in the regional hub with teams of people from varying background and cultural experiences; this broadened my perspective to career and life.

This experience I must say kick off my career. I am definitely a better employee because of this. If you are ever considering joining the CSAP program, my advice is jump right in. The initial days will be tough, stressful, annoying, but it is definitely worth it.","Expect that the kind of culture you get from your cohort/ CSAP hub will change, depending on the country/hub you move to after the end of the program. Some of the fantastic culture you are you used to looses panache; this is common when you move from a larger hub to a much smaller one."
Marketing related,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"Large company, good benefit, good environment, people are extremely nice to each other.  A very nice view of Great America and Silicon Valley from the building.  A very diverse company.","This is for WebEx, a company Cisco bought about a year ago.  This has nothing to do with Cisco, but WebEx alone.  Basically, whoever speaks the loudest will get recognized, not the person who gets the most done.   So hard work and talents usually do not get rewarded with recognition or compensation.  Many valuable talents have left the company because of beauracracy and politics. There are too many mid-level managers that worry about their job security too much, and discourage employee growth.   It is a stable place to be in terms of job security, but if you are young and want to learn and advance, this is not a good place for you."
Business development manager,2.0,"Jul 19, 2008",Current employee,"Large company, diverse product line, focus on growth and attacking new market opportunities.  Strong corporate focus on growing worldwide markets and new greendfield opportunities, which should keep overall company growth on an upward track in the future.","Excessively political environment, where information is often controlled, withheld and used as a weapon for personal and political advantage.  Finding a good group is the KEY issue for you having a good assignment, and job/salary growth and career advancement.  Internal visibility - often over actual performance - is becoming a necessary element for job survival, never mind advancement."
Co-op student worker,4.0,"Nov 20, 2008",Former employee,"Friendly employees, great culture, lots of good benefits and new products coming out.  The San Jose campus is massive, with just over 50 buildings, and there is always work going on somewhere.  The work environment is also good, and the labs are generally well organized.  They also have free soda/tea/coffee, and you can occasionally find free food by going to various presentations.  There are also two gyms and a daycare center, and provide great benefits to full-time employees.  I accumulated the equivalent of 3.5 weeks PTO per year as a co-op/intern, the same as any regular employee.","There are too many managers and executives, and endless business/technical meetings which do not contribute much (in fact the most useful meetings are the meet&greet because they encourage teamwork, even though they have nothing to do with your job).  Also, the work can be slow and boring at times, and you will not be immune to ""burnout"" at Cisco.  As a co-op, I received no benefits other than PTO and hourly pay."
"Systems engineer, security sales",5.0,"Dec 6, 2015","Current employee, more than 8 years","Cisco remains a challenging environment, driven for excellence. For those able to keep up, you're rewarded well, and surrounded by expert peers, managers, and senior managers committed to your success. Training, lab equipment, peer support are readily available for any assignment or task. The mutual respect and support make Cisco a wonderful place to work. The good pay and excellent benefits add icing to the cake. Working from home is a huge plus! The customers are also very easy to work with because they recognize and respect the level of expertise Cisco engineers bring to the conversation. I love my customers!","The demand for your expertise is constant. You have to know how to delegate responsibility to other teams, and learn how to use your resources, the sales team, and partners to get the job done. Otherwise, you'll end up working 12 hour days constantly. (My colleagues who don't delegate are probably accusing me of only working half a day!)"

Big company (though on the flip side, it could be a Cons), plenty of resources
Good to get some experience in a big corp (but don't stay there too long)","Company is too focus on the balance sheet to please the Wall Street. Lack of the vision to be a true technology company. No innovation, no big bets anymore vs the good old days
Smart people left and the current senior management can't provide a vision or direction for the employee, other than constant cost cutting. Regular layoff discourages the people.
Just like any other big corp, some people are not doing there job but stay there while smart people is not rewarded and left with disappointment.
Market is changing faster than it thoughts, big risk to maintain its market shares.

A lot of lateral career opportunity, which can lead to upward career opportunity
Executive team has great vision and works well as a team","Culture change has been hard...moving from box selling, to systems, solutions...now to subscription based software solutions.  Vision is good, but the hard part is retooling the sales machine.  Restructuring has been the tool of choice, which has increased employee stress levels and is beginning to dampen the long standing teaming culture
Rapid change and dramatic evolution have come at expense of support solutions With an ever growing/evolving solutions portfolio, with a significant part of that coming through acquisitions, merging and managing the support data/meta data to a standard architecture and set of tools has been a never ending challenge"

These have happened consistently in the 6 years I've worked at Cisco. It's demoralizing, erodes the strong culture and instills a sense of inevitability for employees
Limited advancement opportunities to Director, VP and above levels - and, annual layoffs at these levels, not tied to performance, but for ""organizational health"" (ie balancing the senior positions to early in career and junior employees)."

- Great benefits especially Medical for my and my families needs
- full week of community service beyond your PTO and everyone is encouraged to find someway to give back
- strong Senior Exec leadership especially during tough times","- During annual 'Limited Restructures', it's not about being a rock star or not, it's your position that is eliminated including whole teams
- Tight weekly commits can cause stress within teams depending on management
- Marketing has continued to overpromise or oversell, Cisco didn't use to sell on roadmaps
- dilution of culture. when I first started you could call anyone from John Chambers down and you would get a response. Now, it's not uncommon for someone to not respond unless you cc: their manager and yours."
Engineer,2.0,"Mar 15, 2015","Current employee, more than 5 years","Salaries catching up to the rest of high tech though they expect you to work two jobs at once
company results getting better gives us hope that they will get out of the frantic mode.","continuous crunch time for the  past 5 years is wearing  people thin. you are expected to work evenings, early mornings, sunday night. You are motivated to do this for crunch time once in a while but this is one continuous crunch time. The company is distressed and with the recent good results they are patting themselves on the back and asking for more. People are voting with their feet and walking out to new jobs. Req for open jobs go unfilled. There is an air of tyranny in the atmosphere and employees that can walk are fed up. And what makes it worse is an air of condescending attitude towards anyone that has not been with the company from the golden days with the old hands full of the not invented here syndrome and taking care of their buddies regardless of performance or ability. It is a Babel of cultures and sometimes very hard to make a change and do the right thing."
Program manager,4.0,"Jul 6, 2015",Current employee,"- Many possibilities, different teams, different positions, working for Cisco allows you to explore different types of roles and team cultures without needing to leave the company
- Flexible working, from home, from another country, from wherever you are. Cisco fully encourages the ""work from wherever, whenever"" as long as you get your stuff done. Good setup at home including video units, secured routers, etc","- The annual re-org seems to have become a trend. Most people you speak to don't expect to still be there by the time retirement age hits
- Working in a more expensive European country means you'll face fierce competition for your job coming from cheaper countries.
- Working for one team vs another can have a huge impact on your softer benefits like education or bonus. A lot depends on your teams' management. Where one manager will tell you ""NO"" on something you ask for, working for another manager might very well result in a ""YES"" to the very same thing.

Global company with a global presence. Great place to start a career right out of college.,"The company values management. Individual contributors who do most of the work are not valued, are given no equity, and promotions are few and far between. They'll tell you there is no money for raises for hard working individual contributor, then a month later several vice presidents will be promoted to senior vice president. This happened over and over when Chambers was CEO. Layoffs are constant (called limited restructurings). In their IT department, where I spent part of my time, they push out anyone who tries to innovate or disrupt. The entire IT organization is run by the same people who've been there since 2000.

No strategy for IoT
Executive Management does a poor job communicating strategy

Cisco allows you to work from home or from any office you like (except for very few office-based positions), it  offers great compensation and benefits, discounts, peer-to-peer reward scheme, amazing offices with good restaurants and lots of perks like massage chairs and nap pods, gym, allows time off for volunteering, good pension contribution. For the ladies, there's also a lot of investment from the company to bring more women into technology and to develop the next generation of female leaders.  There's also a good maternity leave and there is even a nursery at the headquarters","Flexible working has its pros and cons.

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Dec 8, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","CULTURE
-------------
Strong and evolving, focused on engineering quality and outcomes

TECH
--------
On-premise codebases suffer due to legacy, but command a massive customer base and hence continuously refactored and churned with new features. High focus on engineering practices, quality and automation. Solid architectures.

Cloud services and components are new, employ relatively latest paradigms, but lack any significant customer base.

LEADERSHIP
-----------------
Passionate senior management that puts the interests of the org and people above all else. Encourages feedback, ideas and initiatives. Ready to experiment with people, processes and perspectives.

ORG STRUCTURE
------------------------
Relatively flat and transparent, dynamic structures that rapidly evolve to solve problems.

ENGINEERS
----------------
Rock-solid technical leaders, a good percentage of expertise among engineers makes this a good place to work and learn. 

INNOVATION
------------------
General impetus and encouragement to any innovation at all levels. Hacking is highly encouraged.

FUN + BENEFITS
----------------------
Engineers get to use best in hardware, equipments and infrastructure
Relaxed, fun and alive work atmosphere while also being super-intense and engaging
Amazing, huge campus here in Bangalore","Lack of vision at product management - On one hand, the on-premise portfolio is struggling to re-invent and be competitive among newly emerging competition. On the other hand, the cloud strategy and services have turned out to be unimpressive, at least until now. Product Management at all levels is unable to figure this out yet."
Solutions architect,4.0,"Apr 25, 2019","Current employee, more than 8 years","For a big, long established tech firm Cisco have done a great job at keeping in front of technology trends meaning is always new technology to work on and a good vibe around the company that has done very well by most measures across 20 years which is a pretty impressive achievement.","Promotion can be slow. This is largely because churn is low, its common to see senior team members with 15 - 20 years service.  That shows its a great place to work but means new opportunities at the top rarely open up and are hotly contested when they do. 

Regular redundancies and re-org's run through the company. Is pretty well 100% of the time either adjusting to a re-org or learning about the ever more complicated org structure about to be deployed."
Director,2.0,"Apr 22, 2022","Current employee, more than 8 years","Flexible working hours, work life balance, lots of badly managed contra & opex used for employee perks, a lot of folk get paid for doing very little","A sales led company where the leaders lack redbrick / ivy league education and the culture is chavvy / redneck. Educated people don't succeed here, aggressive big mouths do.

Plummers of the internet largely selling overpriced and commoditized kit, it's a hardware company desperately trying to fool Wall Street it has a recurring business. Foolishly missed the Cloud transition, and laughably did not capitalize on Web Conferencing (WebEx) during the pandemic, letting Zoom and Microsoft take the market. Little growth over the last few years, no innovation, and mostly failed acquisitions. The stock price is driven by repurchasing stock and cash repatriation.

The salesman CEO and his team make big claims about racial discrimination, whilst at grassroots nothing is done to tackle the problem, even when it is clearly apparent and raised, promoting a few diverse people doesn't solve the problem.

Winning best places to work is largely a marketing activity which is paid for, Cisco actively partaking in this charade summarises its culture."
Marketing analyst intern,5.0,"Nov 24, 2008",Current employee,"Collaborative work environment. Everyone loves what they do and as a result, they work as a cohesive unit. Great leadership, not too much of a heirarchy. If you have a good idea, then you can take it to the top. Very responsible socially too.

It's a wonderful place where you can grow and develop rapport with fellow employees. I loved my time there and I hope that you will consider it to be one of your top choices as well. Good luck!","I really don't think there's anything wrong with Cisco. I'd say the only probably is that it is so large, that it is hard to find your way around the company. But that's the case with any other company of this size as well. I would suggest that they strengthen their internal communications, otherwise things will get lost in translation. They're also placing a great emphasis on the future, but if these projections turn out to be remarkably inaccurate, this could be very detrimental to the company and your long term future. So theres' a risk involved, as is the case with most tech companies"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Mar 10, 2010",Former employee,"Cisco is innovative and profitable. It continues to grow through acquisitions and is continually expanding its ""footprint"" of products and services. It is considered by some to be one of the best places to work. It offers an exceedingly diverse workforce population in terms of nationalities (primarily Asian and Indian); the compensation and benefits are competitive; there are learning and development opportunities.","Although the company talks about work/life balance, there is an expectation of 24/7 availability,  Not surprisingly, there is an extremely heavy emphasis on the use of techology for all purposes (meetings, communication, getting the job done) such that there is limited support offered by people. Each employee is expected to be self-supporting in all areas, including administrative. There is an inordinate number of meetings during which much is discussed but often with little definitive outcome. Participants like to discuss past accomplishments. Finally, as one would expect, the size and decentralized aspect of the company make it difficult to identify and navigate among departments and people. Thus, it takes longer than necessary to accomplish relatively small tasks and can be very frustrating."
Business manager,2.0,"Dec 4, 2013","Former employee, more than 8 years","They have a lot of money, and that gets them through a lot of bad management. Record profit translates into laying off 5,000 people. Get some skills here and then go work for a company where your talent will mean something.","Cisco is a big monopoly and it is managed badly, but it does not matter because they leverage their monopoly to make money. The internet would be better if the company was broken up into 12 companies based on their monopolies in so many areas. They are a classic example of a place that at one time was great to work for and each year it goes down hill like IBM and Microsoft. I had two alcoholic middle managers that did not care about my group or understand business. You will be a just a number at this company. Cisco's vision is to maintain there existing monopolies and buy start ups that challenge them."
Systems engineer,4.0,"Jan 8, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","Depending on your team and your customer(s), you will have very different experiences. I've been lucky enough to come in through their new hire program (CSAP - Cisco Sales Associates Program) and consistently be part of very young, energetic teams. I love the aggressiveness and go-getter mentality prevalent within my team, and my organization as a whole. It matches very well with the energy we experience working with our customers in Silicon Valley. I've also had great luck with managers -- they are caring and involved, notice the work you as an individual contributor are putting in, and really show their appreciation.","Cisco is of course a very large company, and with it comes the extensive red tape that makes significant change difficult. So, although you get incredible stability and perks working with such a well established organization, it is also very hard to instigate change. Trying to change how a particular product platform works or add significant feature improvements across multiple platforms will take a very long time."

Top level and bottom level workers are good at what they do.
If you have good social skills and want to climb up the ladder then there are good opportunities if your face fits.","Lower management is a joke and more like a boys club. 
Priorities are themselves, then the project then if there is any time/energy left their staff.
They lack of knowledge on how to handle exceptional engineers/people, the ones who come with side effects, so good is the best they will get/keep.
The top people at the bottom (i.e. the engineers doing the work) often do not have great social skills and management can't handle them no matter how good they are at their job of for the project..
You have to spend more time looking after your career than doing the job if you want to climb, it's not a place to survive at the bottom level for long. If you want to stay hand's on then Cisco isn't for you no matter how good you are."

The culture is deteriorating, poor work life balance, you are even asked to work on weekends and no comp offs given if the decision doesn't come from upper management.
Too high work pressure , there is no action being taken to increase the resource pool to meet the demand.
Less rewards or appreciation even when you put extra effort. It is taken for granted that you were bound to work long hours. 
Due to high demanding work load , Managers fail to set goals or proper road map for your career development.
Most of your colleague  are busy and it become difficult to approach them when you are struck and  documentation is also poor and literally no ramp up strategy.

Its a great place to start your career but most early in career people leave to other tech companies after 2-3 years. Cisco doesn't do a good job of retaining some of their top talent. This is a perfect company for those with a family and like a lot flexibility. Most departments are pretty relaxed and hardly ever hit 40 hours of work a week","Overall there aren't too many cons. The two biggest issues I see is a lack of merit increase each year. Some people can stay at their same salary for 5 years. Promotions are fairly hard to get if you don't play politics. Saw a lot great talent leave when they didn't get recognized. 

The only other major con is upper management. There are too many directors and senior leaders that care more about their bonus and don't focus on the bigger picture of doing whats best for the company."

Most people are genuinely trying to do their best for the company.  There is a good opportunity to work globally and certainly to experience interaction with people from around the world, using virtual collaboration tools.","Weak HR means that managers deal with an antiquated performance management process (based on a 15 year old GE model); lots of unhealthy politics at the SVP level and too many Directors sitting pretty due to tenure; recent RIFs have taken a slice out of the workforce, but not out of the much more expensive layers of the organisation."
Senior content manager,5.0,"Jul 10, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco has the perfect balance of innovation, from a technical perspective, and established business practices with a strong customer base. A primary benefit to employees is a reasonable pace. It's possible to do excellent work without sacrificing one's personal goals and the work environment is definitely more collaborative than competitive. An additional benefit is the ability to move about the company to work on different products and projects. 
The employee population is remarkably diverse and both the executive leadership and HR underscore the value of inclusion and collaboration (diversity) in both it's composition and everything it says and does. Cisco takes diversity very, very seriously.
Deep support for working remotely is absolutely outstanding! We're able to draw  talent from all over the world instead of limiting ourselves to only those people who are willing to live in or near Silicon Valley.","The overall culture isn't quite as tech intensive as the culture I've experienced at major software  and services companies such as Microsoft.  At other companies for example, demos of products in development were a critical component of any meeting. At Cisco we tend to focus on the bigger business picture."
Architect,2.0,"Mar 28, 2018","Current employee, more than 10 years","Good salary, good benefits, a great place to work remotely","Ridiculous levels of overhead--pre-pre approval for even simple expenses like a mouse.  Absolutely no approvals for travel of any kind.  Ditto there is absolutely no budget for training at all, even if the courses are internally offered.  You may grow distant from the company/fellow employees etc over time since you'll never actually see any of them.  Managers are promoted past their level of competence.   Simple things like submitting a fix for a bug have masses of overhead.  They change management tools constantly so you'll probably have to update information in multiple places about the same thing.  Lots of the help on the web is archaic and simply results in 404's.  IT support is generally pretty bad too.  The meetings that are held are mostly focused on sales and pitching the information appropriate to sales staff.

You will also be working among some of the best professionals anywhere and will learn many best practices that you can take anywhere.","The top leaders have floundered with their strategy and as such have lost any momentum for growth - do not expect to make big money with stock growth, as this is a mature company (despite being in ""high tech"").

Managers are generally inept - the entire organization is very ""political"" and requires you to spend more time managing upward and sideways than actually getting things done for the business. Be prepared to be coached on opportunities to be ""visible""

If you are lucky enough to grab a big, visible project and if you spend a lot of time managing up, you might get one of the very rare promotions allocated for your organization. A good strategy for new hires is to negotiate for the biggest salary and title you can."
Technical leader ii,4.0,"Aug 1, 2016",Current employee,"Challenging work, freedom to solve problems, good benefits, and pay is very competitive.","Constant cycle of lay-offs.  New hiring is heavily focused on college grads, while lay-offs tend to focus on higher salary experienced workers.  Cisco uses a lot of somewhat unskilled contractors to fill the voids left by lay-offs, leaving some business units in near chaos.  Cisco is top-heavy in management.  There seems to be a line drawn between first line managers and the management team above, where the folks in the trenches making things happen don't really know what that upper layer of management is doing.  Then there's a slew of Program Managers that seem to have no other responsibility other than to feed information to upper management.  Employees in the trenches question the value being provided by upper management."

Little to no support for writers working remotely. Overcrowded freeways  guarantee a 1.5 to 2 hour round trip commute from my home (10 miles from the Milpitas campus where I worked).

- Work life balance is good.
- You are open to take training on any new technologies coming in.","There are many.. let me share few of them:
- If you are joining Cisco Service Provider India, do not expect hike/raise for at least next couple of years. People do not get hike for years(3-4 years).. Promotion is too hard to get.. you need to perform like best in team for 3-4 years continuously to get it..
- There are very less teams where you gain a good domain knowledge while working.. else everywhere just sustenance work.
- Most of managers do not care of your learning/development, their main concern is just to get the bugs fixed on time. So most of them follow the push mechanism to get the work done.
- You wont find any motivation to work. No one talks about new technologies and year by year you will loose confidence in yourself.. as you will work hard even then you wont get any appraisal..
- Most important thing, engineers are treated as slaves. Till the time they need you, you will be treated well and when they don't need you they will find a better slave and dump you.."

It is a place full of diversity, which is a vital factor in getting to know different cultures and collaborating together. Having a high-trust organization such as Cisco helps us avoid micro management and employees are getting most of their potential. Apart from work, we love to have fun and rest our minds from business thoughts. In one of our Global Team meetings we had Chris Martin from Coldplay join us and play a few songs. How cool is that? As a big successful corporation we have a lot of job benefits, newest technology and always moving forward!",Being a part of such big organization means that change is constant and it is something that we need to adapt as the world and priorities are constantly changing too.

There is no clear roadmap for why to evaluate new ideas. Its just that cisco has money so they invest and if it doesnt work then just throw the people out.
2) mass layoffs frequently.
3) constant state of comparison rather motivating for getting things done .
4) people who knows how to sustain in cisco they can but people who are intelligent but dont have the survival skills in cisco wont make it. 
5) 100 of propietory frameworks by cisco ,because of which you will be lost and you wont be able to learn anything new and its very difficult to understand the existing framework completely.
6) 100% revocation of vote for Chuck robbins as CEO.
7) never refer any colleague to join CISCO. Bad place to work.
8) work environment is serious all the time ,no vibrant environment to keep energising people. People here work like robots .such a pity( cisco was once my dream company , and sometimes dream doeant comeout as you think).

Instead I'm stuck in a box, doing stuff a monkey could do.  I have three managers, one is a day to day manager, the other is his supervisor, and the third is my manager/mentor in California.  None of them realy give me the time of day.  My day to day manager is a super nice guy and I have no problems with him whatesoever.  I'm just so discouraged that the opportunities here are so limited.  As a contractor, I have no benefits, I can't use 95% of the features that regular Cisco employees can.  There is very limited career development here, and what there is, I can't touch, not a regular employee (and what there is is just productivity training and the like, not technical training that I actually need)."
Product manager,3.0,"Jun 6, 2010",Current employee,"Learn a lot in a very little time. If you want to know about data communications business, this is the place. If you can survive the grind in the first year, you tend to do well anywhere in the long run. Other than P&G this is the place to learn about marketing and sales. The only place in fact in high tech. I learn't more at work than at business school.","In a large company and particularly in large business units it is inevitable to have  mediocre politicians, who sullify an otherwise excellent atmosphere. Your competency may not always count. Sometimes the mid level leaders can be absolute idiots as well, so you have to watch your back even if you are competent and doing everything right. In other words do your stuff well, but learn basics of being a politician and always watch out for mediocre idiots, they could potentially damage your career at CSCO."
Software engineer iii,4.0,"Mar 3, 2013","Current employee, more than 5 years","The work culture driven by mid- and lower management is extremely good & healthy.

There are silos which work in an extremely aggressive start-up mode (with their own benefits), but this is more an exception than the norm. The flexibility given to employees in terms of telecommuting and work-from-home are very encouraging - cab services, VPN on laptops, home broadband reimbursement etc. 

The Cisco India campus has blossomed over time into a nice cocoon of sorts. It has multiple food cafeterias, a big health centre, a state-of-the-art medical centre and several games / sports facilities (basketball, badminton, cricket, table-tennis, carrom, Foosball, gaming arcades, massage chairs)!! The company has a great healthcare plan for employees and their families, including free annual health checkups.","Even though the management harps about Innovation from India, some groups / teams are working on maintenance-only projects. 

If you're a programmer who loves to work on bleeding-edge technologies and likes (re-)designing entire new products, this may seem a boring place. Lots of Cisco's products work on legacy technologies and it is impossible to re-write them when they earn billions of dollars for the company."

(ie: BYOD for mobile devices and virtual office setups to support remote workers.)","I've witnessed 3 major layoffs since joining the company in 2004 and at least half a dozen re-orgs within Sales Operations.  Salaries are competitive when you first join the company, but it's difficult to advance due to HR policies and bureaucracy.  In my case, it has been a lack of job role hierarchy and descriptions on the part of HR that has prevented me from continuing to advance.  Cisco struggles to attract millennials and the workforce is aging."

Benefits are competitive.,"Week management at the lower levels.  Managers are often expected to be billable instead of being full time managers, leaving little time to truly invest in their people.  Direct reports often work more closely with managers in other groups.  Due to an employee manager's focus on being billable, they are often very unaware of their employees efforts, contributions and successes, yet these same managers are responsible for providing direct reports their annual reviews.  Expect annual layoffs no matter how well the company is performing.  No clear or consistent method for targeting employees for layoff other than nepotism."

Currently we are undergoing a transformation, but this causes frequent reductions in the workforce, change of strategy and its a struggle to feel part of the cisco family that it is often advertised."
Systems engineer,5.0,"Apr 21, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is a leader across many different sub-industries within IT: routing, switching, storage, VoIP, wireless, optical, application acceleration, etc. which allows sales engineers to gain a wide breadth of knowledge and exposure across many different technologies and products. Working with Cisco is very fast paced and you get to play with cutting edge technology that has not been released to the mainstream public yet. Cisco sales managers do no micromanage; they give their employees all the freedom and resources needed to get their job done.","If you don't love electronics or gadgets or computers, you will be lost. You have to love technology to succeed or you will be too overwhelmed. 

When working in sales where customer satisfaction is paramount, sometimes this means you have to make yourself available during non-standard working hours.

Also, because attrition within Cisco is minimal, promotions to management positions within Cisco might be harder to obtain because few managers want to leave."

It's obvious the group in charge of US Benefits is pushing employees to high deductible healthcare plans, with lesser benefits than in the past.
Many people are burned out after 4 years straight of ""limited restructurings"", aka Layoffs. It is a bit like the Hunger Games here. While those who are LR'd have fantastic packages, those who are left are forced to shoulder the additional workload, without increased pay or benefits."

1. Heavy Politics, favoritism.
2. Enormous number of managers , some managers have merely 1 or 2 direct reporting employee!
3. After Cisco acquisition, Nds (D)Managers are struggling to keep their positions.
4.  Bonus/company Share and other perks for only if you are in a ""well connected "" loop , ie if you are your managers favorite.
5. Initial employees who played dirty politics during NDS days  and who was having NDS EMP_No < 200 became managers. Don't expect any etiquette not managerial skills from them.
6. LayOffs  
7. Good that Cisco removed Bell Curve. This tool was used by Nds managers as a means to give big hike only to managers favorites.
8. Work wise, you will be doing repetitive work.
9.  If you are in Manual QC job, this is going to be their end of career. (Play with TV and remote)
10. Basically after Cisco acquisition, Managers are feeling the heat, they are brutally  exposed of their incompetence.

I also want to highlight the following cons:
- missing onboarding process
- processes are vague in general
- close to zero internal documentation

- small R&D investments
- engineers with “senior” titles are weak as engineers

Despite best efforts on this, many good people get sucked back out to sea in these politically charged restructurings. RSU funding is extremely limited for my team, only top 5% (key performers) of individual contributors get any grants. IMHO, comp generally not competitive with industry.

Lack of true leadership in the executive ranks at VP-Director level, especially in the Customer Advocacy/Service Provider LOB, where the execs seem more interested in 'going along to get along' rather than providing true vision or leadership. Some current cost-cutting measures have done nothing more than pass along Cisco's cost of doing business to their employees.

There are some very bright people you will have the chance to work with in your role, and the company has some good CSR programs.","The company talks a lot about transparency but there is very little to none at this time.  Employees often can't tie their work to the overall goals of the company, typically because the goals are constantly in flux.  The promotion opportunities are unclear, as are the steps that you need to take to achieve one.  It is also a true matrix structure, which makes it very difficult in terms of dotted-line reporting relationships, lack of accountability, and being pulled in a lot of different directions."

The demands are sky high and there is very little room for private life and work&life balance, if at all. Customers are absolutely first and you need to devote all your time to work if you want to bring the results and the figures you are expected to.

Teams in TAC with difficult to support products can find themselves overwhelmed with work, while teams supporting other products have nothing to do.

There are multiple customer service offerings at Cisco who's day to day job comes down to nagging TAC about support cases regardless of case progress/status.

Cisco wants to be agile like a startup but has too much overhead in terms of sticking to the status quo and propping up legacy business units to move quickly.

There is a lot of diversity in the company, both technically and culturally, which made it an interesting company to be part of. The international aspect of the company and the willingness to incorporate international values also contributes to the cosmopolitan feel of the company.","Parts of the business have become mature technology, and have lost their fun value. The grind of becoming the #1 vendor in many aspects of IT and Telecommunications has turned the exciting place to work, into a technology factory with little innovation and no radical thinking. Producing the numbers for the next quarter is more important than technical innovation or product development. Even the buildings in San Jose look tired and jaded now.

Now the culture is primarily focused on politics. This feedback is primarily focused at Services and the culture there. A lot of the management is not barely familiar with the technology. When they get barely familiar with the technology, they are playing catch with where the market direction may be headed. Then there is complete ignorance of where the industry is heading with technologies such Virtualization, Analytics and Services in general. Management rewards each other with pats on the back and results of Services performance is not reviewed and weighed as a metric for evaluation. WIth the result innovation is stiffled."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 13, 2016","Former employee, more than 3 years","Solid benefits, good pay.  You'll meet a lot of good people.","Management is weak.  Promotion from within is very much based on social connections not necessarily earned in every case.  Those promoted are not trained in managing people nor are they educated on company policy and process so when direct reports go to them for help it is seldom given.  The annual layoffs are unfortunately required as the company is poorly equipped to manage the bottom 10% out of the company, again, due to poorly trained managers and a weak performance management process.  I left on my own for a promotion but more importantly to feel valued, challenged and to get away from a really arrogant and incompetent management structure. I could have stayed and had the easiest pay check in the world but I respect my capabilities more than being a guy that fits the suit."

I've felt empowered to explore the company with my own interests and passions in mind. Everyone holds the program in high regards, and it has been a great way to get leadership experience. Cisco's Early Career Network also invests in creating an environment of exploration and networking that fosters creativity and innovation within the many employees who are 1-5 years into their career at Cisco. Through this organization, I have had the privilege to connect with similarly motivated people all over the world!","Any global company comes with its bureaucratic challenges, but Cisco maintains a culture of curiosity and innovation that encourages growth throughout your career through challenging the status quo.

Not much diversity in sales teams- a lot of the reqs say “purple hair? Don’t care” when that is most assuredly NOT the case. 
Lots of changes are happening in the CX org without any clear path. You can’t implement changes without actual stepping stones to get there. It feels like we are working for a startup when Cisco has been around for 35 years now. 

They tend to bring in newer people at much higher salaries than those that have been within the company. This is common with a lot of companies, but it makes getting paid fairly compared to the market extremely difficult once you’re pigeonholed in a certain range"

Health and medical benefits are still quite good(unfortunately employees are asked to shoulder more of the financial burden). The new health center and child care center is STATE of the ART.","Even though we have a great CEO, that charisma does not flow down to most of the executive team. It is a BIG & bureaucratic company now.  I was here during the late 1990s boom and a LOT has changed.  There's a lot of mid-managers that just suck the life out of you because they don't care about leading, rather they care about managing their own next promotion.

- Pays huge to freshers from premium colleges, and to Senior Management.","- Pays Low Salary as per market standard of Product companies. Lesser than some big service companies.  Always postpone yearly hike cycles by 1 or 2 quarters.
- Regular firing/LR.
- Too much work pressure. Too many product lines make it difficult to learn for Engineers. Customer escalations, bug counts are day to day worries. Very few old employees left who know product details, so no one is there to help.  
- Managers & Sr. Managers insulate engineers from Directors & VP who are real decision makers for hike & promotions. So mid-level engineers suffer from both side (lot of difficult work, and minimal hikes). Managers take credit & themselves get promoted.

3. mentorship is a good culture in Cisco. My mentors are experienced sales. Besides the training content, my mentors' words are also important to me. Mentors' experience is the best local sales case study.

Director,2.0,"Aug 21, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is a stable, very large company. Has a very good sales & channel organization; decent benefits. Talented resources if engaged properly.","Large company with too much political baggage. Employees & organizations that are not based in San Jose suffer from a compensation perspective, respect and career growth. The overall compensation of the company has suffered over the past 8-10 years as well. It appears to me that Cisco does not value it's experienced employees; hires too much from the outside in key positions without allowing experienced employees a shot at the promotional opportunity. ""You're better off to quit, gain a more impressive title from a smaller company and then reapply to Cisco"". Your chances of getting promoted are better using that tactic then trying to justify it internally."

There are some very interesting projects and many opportunities to learn new skills.  I had a great manager that offered opportunities to work on increasingly challenging projects if they were available and a person was performing successfully.","Senior management does not really understand what kind of resources are needed to implement some of these projects.  Some of the funding and staffing decisions that have been made have been disastrous to the successful outcome of projects, which can be measured by the quality of the implementation and number and severity of issues after Go-Live.

Sustained effective pay cuts such as reduction in restricted stock, no more company-provided internet, no more soft beverages, unreasonable goals (taxes) for technical people not based on merit. Reduction in hiring quality and talent recognition.

Therefore, there are many people that are just moved around to avoid the firing process. Managers are ""highly"" encouraged to move people rather than fire them. Cisco seems to side with the bad employee for fear of reprisal and litigation.
Too many people caught up in following the ""shiny ball"" and not doing the right thing for the customer.

Your boss and organization can change 4-5 times over as many years but your role stays the same. The global nature of how Cisco is structured makes it an interesting place to work but depending on your role you can be working 24x6 as you have to satisfy Europe, Asia and US timezones which necessitates you to work through the evening every night just to catch up."

Overall, I think Cisco sales is a good place to work!","over the period of time I have been with Cisco, I have seen the layers of management grow and the result has made for a lengthy process to get things accomplished.  The continued thickening of processes and procedures is certainly slowing everything down.  One can spend more time on internal meetings than doing what we were employed to do - sell.  Cisco is also no longer the best in compensation, it hands out fewer and fewer RSUs and the raises are in the single low digits.

Sometimes the pieces come together to make a functioning product/service, but only at the lowest levels.

It was a complicated issue; management typically doesn't have time to manage staff at Cisco and actually see whats going on. Many managers have too many employees, some like mine have the title of manager but are really too busy working a sales role.

The product suite is ageing and there's little on the horizon to address that. Much talk about programmability, yet a huge percentage of the company doesn't have the most basic of coding skill, which shows painfully in the work product.

Salaries are diving, advancement is hindered by significant headcount pressure in many regions.

Employee evaluation system is based on an individual's reputation for working long hours, oratory skills in meetings, powerpoint skills in presentations, and popularity with upper management

Advice of developers is disregarded by technical leads and managers, yet failure is always attributed to a lack of effort and communication among the team

Project marketing and team size are used as leverage among management, leading to unhealthy competition between teams, code redundancy, and useless features creeping into requirement lists

The communication between groups & within groups is awful. There are many cliques and if you fit into one of them, it does not matter what you do - you will move ahead. The source code is not shared between groups - meaning you have no access to the source code or their design documents of the group you are working with. You can get it through unofficial channels through acquaintances. Remember cliques. Many details are kept secret and internal management conflicts are too much. The management in many cases is unethical and force you to work on weekends. Hire cheap labor from abroad and ask you to train them.

There is not a lot in innovation coming from the company.  Cisco Buys new technology.

They have a large infrastructure which can be supportive. Teams are open and friendly to new people and it is easy to make friends if you come with an open attitude.,Cisco is an enterprise! There are so many departments within Cisco that no one knows or often dares to ask what they do. Often part of your job might be researching what departments and who are is in charge of the elements you have the responsibility of improving or changing. In some departments they are just now embracing Agile development. Alas to do so they are using multiples of online tools that don't interact with each other. It seems most departments prefer using spreadsheets that are not live or shared and have to be updated by every member of the team to 'stay up-to-date'.
Technical support manager,3.0,"Aug 10, 2015",Current employee,Excellent benefits and starting pay is competitive.,"Raises are almost non-existent.  Raises do occur, but they seem to be only for a small section of employees at the absolute top of the performance scale or who have made the right impression with senior leadership.  So you can do a great job and not see a penny more for 3 or more years.  So while the world becomes more expensive to live in, you are are having less an less expendable income.  If this methodology resulted in more job security it would be worth it, but it is just Cisco&#039;s normal business model to force management into stack ranking exercises to determine who could be fired.  Also, Cisco does not value most experience gained outside of Cisco.  So you may have years of experience coming in the door, you will not be considered for promotions until you have gained the same experience under Cisco."

Cisco used to be a fun and interesting place to work at, now everyone is too busy looking over their shoulders and taking credit for work they didn't do."

Some of the cafeteria are decent.
Employees can go to any of the numerous building covering massive area any time (except lab) and sit anywhere and attend meeting or do whatever.","Public newspaper says Cisco is getting fatter in the middle and need to get rid off excess mid level management. In some way, it might be true but also I saw talented and experienced engineers impacted and incompetent engineers have stayed. They really need to be careful in this respect because many many good employees have left during last year. More jobs are getting done by fewer employees as a result and quality suffers too. 

Encourages new ideas but quality/experiences takes a back seat. Quite a lot of times, there are turmoil

Senior technical leader,4.0,"Dec 31, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","Cisco provides good benefits (10 company holidays, 4 weeks PTO, 1 week volunteering time, 4.5% 401k match, ESPP, maternity/paternity leave, emergency time off), promotes a positive work environment and a healthy work-life balance, and encourages movement within the company (including being rather supportive of remote work arrangements).  The huge range of products provide opportunity for lateral movement.   The large size provides a degree of stability.  Salaries are good but not the highest in the industry.","Cisco has traditionally operated as a number of quasi-independent Business Units. 
 Soft-qualities such as work-life balance, encouraging movement, and quality of management can vary significantly between Business Units.  That said, Chuck Robbins' Executive Leadership Team has been making a concerted effort to address problem areas.  Cisco grows by acquisition so a significant fraction of the innovation happens outside the company.  This also leads to relatively frequent layoffs of redundant divisions and attrition as acquired employees become fully vested and seek opportunities elsewhere."
Software engineer,5.0,"Sep 24, 2012","Current employee, more than 10 years","Cisco Systems is a great place to work and it is getting better. It's a huge company, so it's not all perfect, but when you take it all together you come up with some pretty compelling reasons why leaving the company would be hard to do.

Specifically, if you perform well and work hard, you'll be rewarded well. In recent years it seems that managers have directed more of the rewards to those on the team that contribute more. Makes working longer hours worth it.

Also, flexibility is a huge benefit in Cisco (remote work, flexible hours, etc). This depends on you and your manager, but if you are trustworthy and self-directed you are afforded much flexibility.","If you want Cisco to be a fun place to work, you'll need to create the fun.

 - Still an old boys club mentality at the top...
 - Many executives have been there too long... need to bring in some fresh blood and a new way of thinking.

Business development manager,4.0,"May 28, 2013","Former employee, more than 10 years","There are a tremendous number of very talented and motivated individuals at Cisco with great experience and expertise across the networking technology space, but poor senior management who exhibit flawed strategic planning and execution skills, weakened by self-interest and self-promotion of these executives, leads to sub-par outcomes in a variety of product and market spaces.","Senior management needs major change - including John Chambers - to reinvigorate the company and to help drive winds of change within engineering and product line teams.  A top-heavy management structure needs to be flattened and thinned, and allow for movement of talented and strong performers from lower organizational levels to rise to address new challenges."
Senior program manager,3.0,"Nov 14, 2016","Former employee, more than 10 years","Competitive Salary, Annual Bonus, great IT department.","I worked at Cisco for 14 years - towards the end it was very difficult to get things done.  It used to be that if you saw a problem you could call together a team of people, explain the problem,  everyone would get on board and the team would go solve the problem. 

But once the Bean Counters took over you had to have a budget to get anything done - you could call together a team, everyone would agree that there was a problem, would agree to help you fix it, but you needed a budget. 

To get a budget you had to write up a proposal, submit it, go through multiple reviews and then submit it for the Next fiscal year's budget.   Then if you got the budget, you spent much more time managing the budget than fixing the problem.  The result - it became impossible to get problems fixed."
Associate sales representative (csap),5.0,"May 24, 2021","Current employee, less than 1 year","I was lucky enough to start off my career during the pandemic because Cisco made it possible. They also went above and beyond to make sure their employees were taken care of during these times. It is a cliché, but the best part about Cisco is all the great people you will meet and work with. Even though I am working from home, I am still motivated every day to get out of bed and see my colleagues over Webex and help our customer and partners to succeed in the best possible way.","Cisco is one of the biggest IT companies in the world and is therefore divided into several smaller ""sections"" that make up the company as a whole. That makes me feel like one in a million (or 1:75,000), so if you want to stand out and make a name for yourself it is probably harder to do that in Cisco than in other smaller companies."

Truly a good company that does good to the world,  evidenced by actions, executive focus and dollars invested.","Very slow in making all sorts of decisions. Most functions perform their work with outdated or homegrown tools and systems which hinder productivity.  Moving up the organisation requires honed social ability and a strong established network, more so than good work and performance. Does not offer competitive pay,  and becoming too complacent on being rated #1 Place to work to keep workforce.  External candidates will be paid considerably higher than those already employed, as the market has leapfrogged a clearly broken internal salary range system, and a growing backlog of salary increases and promotions."
Cisco support engineer iii,4.0,"Feb 6, 2009",Current employee,"Since working for Cisco after graduating my growth has been tremendous. Cisco is a place where there are many experts you can learn from and gain experience especially if you're like me, someone out of school two years.","Promotions are slow and its difficult to get recognition. I am lucky in that my manager and I have a good working dialogue and I know he is listening to my concerns. 

If you're ambitious and damn good at your job, you'll start to feel frustrated often at Cisco. Reason being promotions are slow and those who are the lowest performers are rewarded by keeping their job and those who are worth their salt aren't promoted fast enough. Of course, I'm sure this is common with large companies. 

In my opinion, Cisco needs to recognize fresh talent quickly, give them (me) opportunities to grow and responsibilities, and promote them quickly."

Usually, work load not too bad (but it hugely depends on which part of Cisco one's with)","In my experience, if you're not from the right startup acquisition or the right part of the world, you may as well forget about career growth within. (So people go out and come back 1-2 yrs later and get promoted way faster than any amount of hard work within would ever get them promoted.)

There are many processes in place to do almost every activity, and there's also an excess of surveys or polls to measure many of the aspects of work which is needed but when every area does this many times you spend a lot of your day just answering surveys.

Senior business development manager,4.0,"Jun 27, 2016",Former employee,"Overall Cisco is a great place to work!  
- Cisco has smart people that are passionate about delivering industry-leading products to customers.  
- Cisco is the 500-pound gorilla in the industry, which allows them to put an incredible amount of resources to focus on critical market transitions or specific product area.  
- Cisco has built a solid reputation for delivering great products and customer satisfaction.  
- Compensation and benefits are at the top of the industry.
- Reasonable work hours and great work-family balance - not a startup.","As with any big company there are some downsides.
- Bureaucracy and processes that create ""business prevention"".  There are too many people who can say ""no"" and stop business.  Too many hoops to jump through
- Because the company is so big, Cisco spends a significant amount of time ""internally"" focused on processes and not enough time focused on ""customers"" or important problems.
- Very little opportunity for advancement with continuous restructuring for the last 6 years.
- Bloated and complicated organizational structure with overlapping roles and responsibilities in many areas"

- Depending on what group you are in, can be a fun place to work
- Chance of exposure to different technologies as the company does encourage mobility.
- Compensation is fair: base salary plus annual bonus (which is based on company and individual performance). Company also gives out RSUs.","- Upper management often out of touch of the underlying problems, leading to either inaction or worse ill informed decisions
- Company struggles to innovate due to very heavy processes that stifle putting ideas into action. Cisco, with their big wallets, can overcome this via acquisitions.
- Acquisitions typically struggle to innovate and grow their products. Instead, becomes a sustaining shop. Overtime, their products either get eliminated or outsourced and the original group gets laid off.
- Annual layoffs which nurture a sub-optimal culture. It does not matter if you are really good or not. if you happened to be on the wrong project, you can be impacted.
- Annual peer ranking to feed into the annual layoffs. Everyone is aware of this process -which encourages less than ideal behavior
- Raises are slim or too infrequent."

If you're not an engineer, it's hard to feel appreciated for what you contribute. The lay-offs seem haphazard. They say that it helps week out low-performers, but they give blanket percentages across the organization, so obviously many good employees are caught and it leaves the remaining teams to pick up work for several people. Doing this over and over is demoralizing. Many of my co-workers only stay because they don't think they can find a remote job that will pay as well. Not exactly inspiring."

I also received quite a bit of responsibility and autonomy in my day to day job. That said, that was not the case in the first division I was at.","It's a big company...Priorities change quickly, managers change, etc so you have to feel comfortable with sometimes choppy waters in terms of focus and direction.

Depending on your field, Cisco will give you the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects and technologies.

They typically have held their job for many years and are not interested in change, even when shown it is necessary and beneficial.

Lots of money - good pay relative to industry, good benefits.
Fascinating, hard work.
Generally a lot more openness, and startup feel than you'd expect at such a large company.","Management became a bit top- and middle- heavy.  Large company problems, projects would be cancelled (usually justifiably!) later than they should have been.  Some business functions that fell across Business Units would be hard to co-ordinate.

1. No regular/proper hikes. If you want proper hike, you need to switch divisions at regular intervals. You are not important to your division.

2. Layoffs (2 cases: Either you( or your division) are not doing good or if some top level management  guy makes some crap decision. Long term survival is difficult.

3. Top management expects too much profit margin from projects(60%), doesn't respect customer needs. Management decisions effect a lot division business, which results in shutting down of division. Be smart to predict these and move to some other division or company....

4. Very frequently buy other companies without proper reasons, burn hands, and shutting them.

5. Less innovation.

In John Chambers' time, this interval is 6 months. 
Normally, at Cisco, each time only 8 - 15% employee got promoted. Even the interval is 6 months, it takes > 3 years for a regular staff to get chance promoted in average. Now Chunk make it 18 months or more, the simple calculation will tell you that each promotion takes more than 10 years in average !

-Flexible with taking off early for appointments (as long as not during your queue time)","-Limited number slots for promotions/raises, and promotions/raises happen once a year
-TAC pay is not great (Cisco is a sales organization, and thus the money is in sales)
-Long line of people for Technical Leader positions, can take years before you are considered (even if you have been operating at that level for years)
-Can be difficult to convince upper management to allocate more reqs, teams can drown and become heavily demoralized before reqs are approved (and take even more time to hire the right person)
-Older companies such as Cisco can be heavily political"
Csap - ase,5.0,"Aug 30, 2019","Current employee, less than 1 year","- What I can only describe as the ""Cisco Heartbeat"". From the minute you start at Cisco, you start to feel part of something bigger. We are one united global team.  At Cisco we train hard and push each other to drive business success, so we have the privilege of giving that success back. We are on a mission to impact 1 billion lives globally, and I know thats only the beginning.
- Cisco is a world class company, and an industry leader in networking technology.
- As big as Cisco is, they provide each and every employee with the tools and support they need to truly be the best version of themselves.
- Hands down the best office culture I have ever experienced.
- Incredible benefits for all employees
- We have a ping-pong table in the office","- It may seem biased but I have no cons about Cisco...
- The interview process is VERY TOUGH compared to other companies, but it is only to find people who are driven enough to do great things in this world."
Manager finance,4.0,"Jul 8, 2011",Former employee,"Flexible work culture, Can work from home regularly. Benefits such as 401K and bonus are very good. Can move internally, i had 6 jobs in 11 years.","Very complex org going through changes. Lack of transparency on how promotions are given out promotions. Those who get promoted do not get any new responsibilities and in the subsequent annual reviews you get dinged for not performing at a level higher than earlier.
Cannot blame the people managers as people are graded on a curve and managers are forced to follow directions from VP down."
Project manager,3.0,"Jul 18, 2012","Current employee, more than 5 years","Cisco has an impressive amount of talent and an excellent portfolio of products. They are great at selling their services, software, and hardware.","Cisco relies too much on it's past successes and doesn't seem to be doing anything currently to successfully to maintain their position. Also, the company has grown beyond a start-up but still maintains that they have a ""start-up mentality"". This is wishful thinking. There is a huge amount of bureaucracy an inefficiency as with any company of similar size. Also, they are very big on talking about work-life balance but the reality is: If you want to be a good Cisco Employee, you are expected to live and breath Cisco.

Some are o.k. with that and there are opportunities to succeed. However, if Cisco doesn't start moving to create new, exciting products and reclaim their efficiency and speed of development, the company will continue to lose it's market position and it's reputation in the industry will continue to degrade."
Senior program manager,3.0,"Nov 19, 2014","Former employee, more than 10 years","One of the things that I liked the most about working at Cisco is that you are usually working with some very smart and talented people.  The majority of my coworkers were great people to work with, were excited when faced with new challenges and liked to get things done.

Good benefits
Generous severance package
Ability to work from home","Massive annual layoffs

Executive management in denial that Cisco is one of those companies that regularly has layoffs

The company is now run by bean counters and is forcing departments to move towards a ""service"" model.  That means that you need a budget to get even the smallest tasks accomplished.  It was once  easy to pull together a team and get things accomplished.  The employees still want to do this, but they are now forced to ask where the funding will come from.  

Too much outsourcing of critical functions to people that don't fully understand the consequences of their actions."
Sales engineer,4.0,"Jan 23, 2017",Former employee,"This review concerns the Sales organisation. Cisco offers some great opportunities for engaging with top clients in a broad range of technologies. Although some claim work culture is tough, I can't agree with that: it may be demanding, but there is room for initiative and good initiatives get rewarded in a fair manner. Working culture with collegues is informal and pleasant. For sales engineers there are many opportunities for ongoing learning on new technologies.","Being a large gobal company it is very top-down oriented.  there is little room for strategic initiatives within the country organisations. If you fit well in the strategic plan, you have a wonderful job, if not, there is hardly room for changing this. For account managers specifically: Cisco is strongly steering on monthly revenue commits, resulting in a rather short term vision for many AM's. Only the High Touch AM's will have the opportunity for a more long-term approach. This is something you like or don't."
"Director, product management",4.0,"Jul 15, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","Generally, Cisco pays well and the benefits are top-notch, with RSU grants, company stock purchase plan, health/dental/vision insurance, and 1-for-1 401K matching for the first 5% of your salary contribution.","The environment is very political with multiple VPs jockeying to see who will rule them all and building empires. There are constant reorganizations and cost-cutting leading to yearly layoffs. It's almost impossible to get promoted unless you happen to work on whatever is the hot new product. Raises are scarce (because they add to long-term cash outlay); most ""rewards"" come in the form of one-time bonus or RSU grants. It's a highly bureaucratic culture that rushes from crisis to crisis without adequate strategic accountability."
Country manager,5.0,"Dec 23, 2021","Former employee, more than 1 year","Cisco Systems hires brightest talents in the market. Well-educated, open minded, experienced, sociable, eager to face new challenges, constantly pushing themselves out of the comfort zone and working on continuous improvement. Great management and very supportive. I did not feel hierarchy pressure and could address my concern or question to the top of the top of senior leadership. Senior leadership always backs salesforce out there in the field, generating demand and making revenue for the company. Cisco Systems also emphasizes internal mentorship and coaching programs, pushes team for trainings and continuous learning. Great company to work for.","Supply chain, logistics, slow internal processing clock speed leads to issues with customer experience and satisfaction. Sometimes, it is easier to cancel the initial order placement and request a new shipment, which has high chances to arrive early. Sometimes it is hard to engage security team to make a demo or pilot for a customer whose business is small or medium, perhaps this has improved in the last three years."
Software engineer iv,2.0,"Oct 12, 2011",Former employee,"Still some name recognition, although rapidly diminishing value
Exposure to new technologies, though not well thought out
Bonus is decent at times
Ability to work from home
Talented peer engineers","Work from home is expected (Silently mandatory), and is over abused.
Long work hours worse than start-ups without the adequate rewards in terms of potential stock gains - kind of moot since Cisco stock is stuck in a quagmire.
Gradual erosion of benefits to the point of penny pinching leading to loss of morale.
Steady deterioration in health benefits to the point that health benefits at start-ups are better.
Managers and Senior management are getting fat over the backs of engineers.
The pulse survey is a joke and exists only to meet some ISO 9000 audit.
Not a good place for an engineer over the long term."
Account manager,2.0,"Sep 3, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","Flexibility to work from home is a tremendous plus. 
Do enjoy working with and for my customers.","Limited opportunities for women in many areas. Cisco talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk. Many older male bosses or leaders pretend to support women in public but in actuality are either disparaging, talk over you or just ignore you. 
Layoffs every year cause panic and discontent.
No raises - even if you work very hard and accomplish much and your reviews are consistently high, the pay increases are just not there. Better negotiate a good starting pay because spending a long time at Cisco, does not reward strong talent. 
CEO receives an 80% raise yet excellent/outstanding employees are given minimal or no raises.
Yearly reorganizations but no opportunities. Employees remain in their jobs for years and even decades because there is nowhere to go!  Management just shuffles people around and most times, it's difficult to understand their reasoning."
Engagement manager,3.0,"Nov 18, 2014","Former employee, more than 1 year","It was good company to work for while employed. Flexibility, very competitive environment, good salaries.  Cisco provides you with the best resources to perform your job.","The constant layoffs put a ton of stress on most individuals and cause a great loss of unproductivity and disgruntlement.  Also, decision on layoffs is sometimes unjust and the company does not provide a reason even to best performers which leads many to believe that there is a lot of bias and favoritism. Its a tight ""buddy-buddy"" system.  I saw things such as an young woman who worked at a call center for less than a year get promoted to making big figure salary with no education, technical or professional background while professionals that had been with the company and established invaluable relationships with big customers got laid off for no understandable reason."
Solutions architect,5.0,"Jun 30, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","I've been working at Cisco for 8 years. As a woman, the work flexibility I have to manage my work along with my family needs has been a key reason that I love my job. As I am coming to the end of raising two children, I can look back and feel proud of what I was able to do for Cisco and for my family. The work is always challenging and I have been given almost endless opportunity to use my skills and experience to add value to Cisco. I have been consistently well rewarded for my work, and I have never felt that my gender was a hinderance in what is often considered a male dominated industry. In fact, there have been many opportunities presented because I am a woman, as Cisco takes it's commitment to diversity of all kinds very seriously and they put their money where their mouth is.","As with any large company, there are some disconnects that exist in strategy and approach alignment, but I believe this is very difficult to completely overcome in any large company."
Customer success manager,4.0,"Nov 13, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","Cisco has a strong brand for good reason, our technology creates the industry benchmark.
Cisco encourages innovation, and as a result we are continuously improving and creating relevant products & solutions across vertical industry & market segments.
Collaboration is encouraged, and making use of the tools allows the individuals the flexibility of managing our personal lives, whilst still being inspired to overachieve in this highly competitive business.
The learning & exposure opportunities are endless, and in the right markets there is a huge opportunity to grow.
Cisco has exceptional leaders, creating a solid vision, where the technologists can innovate, and the sales & engineers can expect the technology to work as expected.","The expectations on achieving sales objectives can sometime be ruthless, and having one bad year could compromise your role in the company.  The trends of constant restructures & reorganisations is negatively impacting on the employees moral."

Our leadership is strong and diverse, and the amount of visionaries that lead the charge on technology is amazing!  Working for an industry leader across multiple technologies/verticals gives you insight into the macro environment, rather than just little niches of a challenger brand.  Compensation is on par, and financial benefits (ESPP, stock options, 401k) are excellent.  The company also has a heart -- and puts its money and time where its mouth is.  Volunteering is encouraged, and the opportunities are endless to give back to the community and the world (and in ways that are important to YOU).","Being in sales, it can be all-consuming, but 'work-life integration' is possible.  One has to be comfortable with change -- as ""sameness"" isn't an adjective that I would use to describe the environment.

Observed the work overloading on Contractors and Visa-holders in majority of the teams, as they always struggle to secure their jobs, agree to do whatever the low-profile work assigned to them by managers. Most managers knowingly do this, that benefits some lazy full time employees with poor performance and too many personal priorities during the work hours, who doesn't have visa limitations. No value for the talent & hard work. Lay off lists are prepared as per the convenience of the managers and HR, to secure their jobs with less or no efforts on identifying the bottom performers who are surviving in the company for decades with high salaries."
Account manager,1.0,"Aug 24, 2008",Current employee,Cisco is a great name to have on your CV. Represents a good opportunity to meet lots of big customers and do some big deals.,"This is one arrogant company. The general view is that we should feel very lucky to be here, and that staff are expendable. There is no real opportunity to progress, you can only get on by sucking up to the right people.  Praise for doing a good job does not exist.  The company is making the job as hard as it can in a tough environment, in the hope that people walk, as they have over recruited already and don't want to make people redundant. UK management team are not industry leaders, just yes men to the US and only understand management metrics for monitoring staff. The people who have been doing a good job successfully for years get over looked and taken for granted, while the self promoting ""connected"" brown nosers get promoted.

Out of the box ideas get shut down immediately b/c it won't be approved due to all the complicated politics. Everybody learned to play safe and there's virtually no innovation in the company.

Pay raises and career advancement hard to come by. Horizontal movement is encouraged but again, it's mostly horizontal with same boring work.

-Lots of bureaucracy involved in generating and following through on ideas. 

While I joined as a recent college grad, most people at Cisco are in the latter half of their careers. This limits some of the entrepreneurial spirit and stifles some of the more creative ideas.

Compensation model for non-sales personnel was consistently below market, and there was a polly-annish devotion to stock options.  Who remembers ""The drive to 35?""  Unwillingness to recognize that it had become a large-cap, slow-growth company, and needed to move from an options to a restricted stock model. 

Managers have too much control over review process, and there is too little emphasis on rewarding talent in a fair and consistent manner.   Perception is much more important than reality -- e.g. review process too focussed on peripheral ""initiatives,"" rather than  business results.

Cisco has an ""aquisition culture"" that is mirrored in its hiring practices as well.  It's common to have 10-15 interviews for a new hire req as they are looking for the perfect person.  The problem, however, is that rigor is also applied to internal moves.

Systems engineer iii,4.0,"Oct 7, 2011",Current employee,"It's a pleasure to work with bright people who care about what they do, and trying to do the right thing for customers and partners. Huge choice of different sectors of networking to work on. Most of the time the company treats its employees well, and certainly communicates well, encouraging staff to understand why the company is doing what it's doing. Working from home is possible where it fits into your business activities.","Since most of the employment opportunities in the UK are in the Sales organisation, there is limited scope for a technically-oriented individual contributor to advance without going into management. Excessive use in recent years of TelePresence (great productivity tool though) means that team building and maintaining the strong culture has taken a back seat. SEs are stretched very thinly."

Software engineer iii,2.0,"Feb 2, 2015","Former employee, more than 5 years",Pay is good as are benefits.  Work from home is generally supported as is balanced work/home life.,"Visibility into what really goes on within the regional companies is not very good - except when it comes to profit.  Cisco frequently performs reorganizations under the guise of shifting business priorities.  Actually, however, they are purging the ranks of older workers.  During the last layoffs of ~6500 employees, only a few problematic employees were laid off - all the rest were just older (50s - 60s).  It is obvious that employees are important in a limited way.  They are just fodder to be thrown away when too old."

Flexibility in terms of work life balance and leveraging technology to work wherever you are.","High performance culture with freedom and flexibility may also lead to a 24x7 working schedule, so it requires a level of maturity from each individual, and a clear line of communication with your immediate manager, to ensure that the ability to work anywhere/anytime does not consume you."

Overall pretty stable, though there have been annual 5-10% layoffs in the summer for the last few years.","Pay is low for the effort, raises are meager. Employees are asked to meet ridiculously tight deadlines even if it means working 50-60 hours a week for multiple weeks. Work life balance is absent - employees are expected/required to be available in the weekday nights and weekends. Management comes across as self-centered and high handed. Growth/career advancement opportunities are minimal - those who are good at office politics get promoted, hard work isn't recognized as it should be. The culture leaves a lot to be desired - in my years here, I have come across a lot of rude and curt colleagues at the company. There should be more open dialogue/transfer of information between the management and the team."
Consulting systems engineer,3.0,"Jul 26, 2017","Former employee, more than 8 years","I loved being challenged and learning new technologies.

They no longer care about the employees and only care about their quarterly earnings. 
Cisco keeps chasing innovation when they should be the innovators. They have the reputation of killing off products. 
Management changes every year will eventually hurt them. Just because it was successful while John Chambers was CEO doesn't mean they will be successful in the future. Always doing the same thing will not always result in success; by constantly changing management every year they are doing the SAME thing."
Financial analyst,5.0,"Oct 6, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco's LIFT program provides exceptional training and development opportunities in the program. Because you rotate to a new role every 6 months, you create a large network of highly skilled professionals over the two years in the program. The managers in the program are invested in your development and put in a significant amount of time to accelerate your career. In addition there is frequent exposure to executive leadership and several opportunities to lead initiatives and events. Cisco's culture is also very inclusive and gives back generously to the community. Benefits package is also great.","Pay is average and you are hired into the LIFT program a grade below other entry level Financial Analysts at Cisco. LIFT program director controls compensation & bonus. Performance evaluations in the LIFT program are heavily weighted on presentation skills and training test scores from a 1 week training, and only partially on your role performance. If you score average in the training, you will receive an average bonus even if you have high ratings on your role performance."
Data scientist,4.0,"Dec 4, 2020",Former employee,"Cisco has always had female leadership presence and because of that, the company takes work life balance very seriously. Also, because they invented telecommuting, that lifestyle is built into their DNA. Almost everyone I worked with was excellent. When we got our red tape out of the way, we did a lot of cool stuff.","The company is gigantic. This primarily manifests itself in 2 ways: Layoffs and Bureaucratic Slowdown.

Cisco pretty much has a standard policy of cutting 10% of the workforce every, single, year. A lot times the layoffs make ZERO sense at all, and people often get rehired at higher salaries. It's almost a Silicon Valley tradition to be laid off off from Cisco at some point in your career.

From a software/Data Science perspective, the red tape primarily shows itself in data access. Finding the right data steward and actually completing data permissions is a frustrating and circuitous process. But, on the other hand, red tape slows things down so much it's pretty rare to get overwhelmed."

Over 5 years havent seen more then 5% base salary growth (though I admit when hired they gave a high competitive package, but no follow up after that). Over years have only seen cut backs in all sort of spending while competitive companies did the same, but have restored balance. Over the years the pride / employee satisfaction for working for this company is diminishing. Lot of better younger attitude competitive companies out there."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Mar 9, 2012",Former employee,"Great place to work. Very competent very helpful teammates. Cisco knows how to hire the right people who are very capable. In my experience, direct managers were always respectful and would understand the responsibilities of the job.

Above market pay. Above market vacation time. Good benefits","It is a large company so there is quite some hierarchy with numerous senior management positions between the CEO and the technical employee.  There is little interaction between senior management and end employees so this makes it easier for senior management to commit to restructuring plans that involve layoffs to improve earnings reports.

Cisco could use some work in the training department.  Cisco constantly releases new products; however there is little training offered on these new products for employees that interact/support etc with these products."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 25, 2014","Former employee, more than 10 years","Some good people work here.  They can be very supportive, freely share expertise, information, and are excellent problem solvers.","Management is mostly clueless, and  cronyism is rampant.  It's more about personal relationships than actual ability.  It's about the personal bottom line, and 98% of management cannot handle constructive criticism.  This is killing company growth and profitability.

Too many people who take credit for, and are awarded for, the work of others.

Watch your back, who you share information with, and be aware and wary of those who view you as a threat to their desire for recognition and upward mobility.

There is a lot of work but the co-workers are good.,"There is an immense amount of work in my organization.  This may not be across Cisco but this org is making folks work 50 ~ 60 hours a week.  Also to add to it the GM of this organization has explicitly stated that there is no working remotely for this organization.  So Add a 20 hour commute, (I live in the East Bay) to the 60 hour work week gives extreme exhaustion.  If you have to work from home you need approval from Senior management even for rare occasions.  Also managers talk to you if you repeatedly work from home"
Contract negotiator,5.0,"Nov 4, 2017","Current employee, less than 1 year","The Cisco Benefits are unmatched.  However, beyond the benefits, 4.5% match in the 401(k), the extra time off, is the overall culture of the company and those that ensure that the culture of inclusion and diversity endures.  As a Veteran of the Marine Corps with 29-years of service, I was concerned that a civilian company would not share the same values or have a level of camaraderie even close to that of a military organization.  I was very wrong.  I have found that and more here at Cisco.","Open working areas can be more collaborative but not appropriate for all practice areas, such as areas that may require sensitive HR or Legal type discussions.

Technical support engineer,3.0,"Apr 29, 2021","Former employee, more than 10 years","- Competitive pay
- Name recognition
- Established company so it's expected it will be around awhile

- No loyalty to their long time employees, they will lay off better workers and keep the ones that everyone wonders why/how they still have a job there. Seemingly arbitrary.
- Company is way too big, you'll always feel like a number
- Sketchy leadership in some divisions
- They buy companies doing great things and then lay off the teams that made them that way and water down the product.

I know it sounds like I am a scorned employee who was laid off, but I wasn't, I was just appalled at how others fared in these quarterly chopping blocks. I left of my own accord for a better work environment and it was one of the better decisions I've ever made."

Lots of policies, lots of old corporate systems and processes that we were theoretically supposed to know how to use, and a feeling of detachment, of being several levels down in a 70,000+ node tree.  Some things hadn't changed in years or decades, but there were also (from my perspective) unnecessary and disruptive changes while I was there; big changes in both health and retirement benefits providers within one year.  The experience of being an employee at Cisco seemed to involve a lot of complexity that had more to do with the company's size and age than with my work or what I wanted from a job, and I would have preferred a simpler employee experience where I could focus on getting actual work done."

Values modeled by Chuck and ELT do not percolate down the ranks. Culture is very inwardly focused in middle layers.

The products my teams were supporting had thousands of users/paying customers, however were of low interest for management in terms of acquiring a budget or 3, 4 resources to complete the project.

4. Lot of team socials, outings to keep the mind fresh and entertained and informed.","1. Management does Poor planning on work and lot of fire fighting customer issues.
2. Very little focus on talent development, its left upto the individual to find own way in the ocean, no guidance is provided.
3. Extremely inefficient meetings. Huge amount of time wasted in digressions from the main agenda. Infact some times the agenda is not even communicated before the meeting.
4. Complete lack of focus on individual contributor skill development and training. Individual is left to fend for him/herself."

Good benefits","Despite Cisco being a large company, you should expect and be comfortable with change. Processes are continuing to evolve and adapt as Cisco aligns its efforts with its strategic vision. It can be a fun challenge to contribute to and be a part of that change but it also requires patience along the way. The tools and resources provided to us to do our jobs can at times feel numerous and complicated trying to piece it all together but great effort is being put into tying it all together"
Senior global marketing manager,5.0,"Feb 27, 2018","Current employee, more than 3 years","For a 70,000 person, global company, there are so many things to be PROUD of in working for Cisco. As an LGBT leader at Cisco, I am happy to be myself, and encourage others to do the same. There is tremendous executive support for our LGBT brothers and sisters at Cisco, across the globe. Cisco's continued 'foot on the gas pedal' delivering on Inclusion & Diversity aren't just words, rather, actions that continue to grow. #CiscoPRIDE is alive and well.","The only 'Con' I can muster up is the opportunity to find new opportunities within Cisco for many people. Cisco is not a high growth company, so not adding 100s of jobs/week, like some others. That said, there is tremendous opportunity for cross teaming, working on stretch assignments, and raising your hand to do 'other' things."
Senior partner account manager,1.0,"Sep 1, 2020",Former employee,Average salary and good benefits,"Cisco is an organisation which is devoid of any genuine ethical or moral credibility. Despite the efforts they go to with their PR activity. Cisco's culture causes mental illness far too regularly. Cisco discriminate against people who have mental health issues. They are actively covering up and misrepresenting the scale of the harm their sales teams are being subjected to by wilfully discriminating both financially and through their actions, against anyone who suffers mental ill health due to the stresses of the role. Also, not enough support to avoid burnout - Always connected culture leads to burnout - likely to be harassed by sales leadership quite often including evenings and weekends. Cisco DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANY EMPLOYEE - THEY BRAINWASH THEIR WORKFORCE INTO BELIEVING THEIR SPIN."

- Complicated products! Look at how complicated SDA is, look at how complex our ""multi-domain"" strategy is. 
- Awful product quality. It's sad that we have to vet out our products for our customers in order to avoid trainwrecks (e.g. When FTD was released, SDA right now, ISA before 2.0)
- Silo'd. We talk about how we offer an end-to-end solution, but when it comes to sales, deployment, and even post-sales support everything is extremely silo'd. Have a multi-architectures solution? Good luck! 
- No career growth opportunities unless you move. Extremely difficult to get a grade bump or raise.
- Pay is no longer competitive compared to other big vendors. 
- YEARLY layoffs! Sometimes twice a year."

A diverse culture within every department. Great benefits for health and finance.,"Uses the GE philosophies on employee reviews using a bell curve to evaluate and a mandatory number of employees must be in the top range to be promoted and the bottom in a high pressure situation to quit or be fired. The average or core personnel are given the carrot of still getting a bonus, but no promotion or raise. The environment leads to a lot of back stabbing and almost no collaboration between peers who fear giving someone an advantage over them during reviews. One of the most dysfunctional places  I have ever worked."
Financial analyst,4.0,"Nov 21, 2011",Current employee,"One of Cisco's greatest pros is work/life balance the company provides to its employees; there is great flexibility when taking time off, and/or working remotely (ie. from home). In addition, Cisco provides its employees with excellent collaboration tools that allow for flexibility in work schedules, and an improved interface between employees in locations around the world. Cisco is an incredibly diverse company, and fosters an environment that is truly global. Lastly, I would cite that Cisco is a very generous company when it comes to benefits and caring for its employees.","Career development and Recognition have been cited by employees as areas Cisco needs to improve in. At least in my business segment, promotions are rare, and as someone who is rather low in the corporate ladder, there is very little room for growth. In addition, there are very few (if any) mentors among senior staff members that can help younger employees grow in their careers."

Abundant resources and strong business intelligence make for some interesting products.","Death by process! Everything is so procedural, you spend significant time going through administrative steps to get  small, simple tasks done. Cisco is a lumbering elephant and has trouble focusing on a single sector or line of business. Overall company values are strong, but not nor applicable to certain business units. This is where some products or initiatives can fail. Middle management is an dense line of ego maniacs. Employees cannot thrive under that structure."

You can get lost easily in this large company if you don't proactively manage your career.  A number of high-performing employees either new to the company or new to their role were given an average performance rating because ""they were new""... This is indicative of a seniority based company, not a performance based company."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Dec 12, 2012","Current employee, more than 8 years","- Interesting and challenging work
- They treat their people with respect
- They are constantly trying to improve how they do business","-  Constant reorganization -  On the plus side though they do this to best align their resources with market needs, so other than the angst it creates for the people affected, this is not such a bad thing.  They invest in areas that appear to have the best growth/margin opportunities, while cutting back in slower growth or lower margin business areas.  The reorgs are not not company wide, and are focused in specific areas of the business, which varies with time, so this should not be misconstrued as poor management.  It's exactly the opposite. I believe we have excellent senior management.  They are constantly evaluating how to change and adapt, which allows the company to stay relevant with customers, and to grow their overall business.  Ultimately, that is good for both the company and employees."

Stock is flat, so options don't mean what they did.
From a customer's perspective the company has lost their soul and forgotten that the customers put them where they are today. Too many companies now buying ABC - Anybody But Cisco because Smartnet is expensive and of dubious benefit when engineers just send you links so you can Read The Fine Manual.

I never felt that I couldn't give an opposing view.

Relaxed culture. What you would expect of a silicon valley but Cisco is big I expected they would have been more up tight. Was not the case no matter what office I visited (east, east, north or south)

Vast portfolio and always something to talk to your customers about. Great sales engineers which are the key to success.,"Cisco has a weekly commit culture which comes with a grind and a narrow focus versus a big picture mentality which is a must for Enterprise and Large clients. When front line mgmt is only concerned about the weekly number, focus is lost on the big picture and doing all the intangibles to overachieve your number. This is my perspective only based on my situation and may not be the case elsewhere."

Great benefits
great work/life

Senior product manager,1.0,"Jul 16, 2008",Current employee,Cisco does pay a bit higher than the rest of their peers.  It is a large company so being able to move around is quite easy especially if you know people in the targeted area of your choice.  John Chambers is an excellent CEO and a strong leader.,"Promotions, especially when it comes to Director level and above are difficult to come by and is more a matter of who you know versus your accomplishments.  Cisco does seem a bit top-heavy in management and that also prevents one from moving up more quickly.  With any large company, there seems to be ""fiefdoms"" of organizations that have questionable reasons for existence.  In other words, sometimes you're not so sure what function that organization was created to do and what value do they bring to Cisco in the big scheme of things.  It becomes less and less clear on how one's day-to-day work applies to Cisco's Top Business Priorities so at times you might feel that you're not really making much of a difference."
Staff engineer,4.0,"Oct 3, 2008",Current employee,Pay is very decent but I will not say it is outstanding.  I don't feel bad but I wish I could feel better. Management training seems to be good.

John Chambers a little too preachy and new age.  They seem to be playing the ""be good enough"" compensation wise.  I prefer pension and 401k mix.  I prefer less nickle and diming on health care.

I have been with the company for 10+ years and it's still a place I (usually) enjoy going every morning. When I wanted more responsibility, I just did it. In my experience you don't need to ask, just do it. Cisco encourages risk-taking, but if you're not a risk-taker, you'll do fine. Just do your job well. Free soda, popcorn, 4 wks vacation, generous compensation, and a company that is growing are all reasons Cisco is a great place to work.",Cisco's history of decentralization makes it hard to get the entire company to move in one direction.

It is important to remember that Cisco, especially the marketing department, largely consists of middle-aged to older people who are already settled in their lives (kids, marriage, finances, etc). As a young, unattached professional, you are at a career advantage where you have the time to 1)Go physically into work and develop real one-on-one relationships with colleagues. 2)Devote time after work to networking with other tech marketing individuals. 3) Work with other young people who are more willing to take the financial risk and devote time to develop a start up.

The night life of employees are also important because the human resource manager needs to have more 1 on 1 conversations with its employees. That should be the corporate responsibility of the managers at Cisco and  the new direction of the HR sector.

Anonymous employee,5.0,"Apr 26, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year","The work life balance at Cisco is incredibly unique. All you need is your laptop and wifi and you can work wherever you'd like (in most cases, some functions do not have complete flexibility). I live thousands of miles from my family & friends, but Cisco encourages me to go home and visit whenever I'd like, without having to take any time off. I can only imagine how wonderful this flexibility will be when I'm a mother some day. I've had numerous coworkers stay home with a sick child or take some time out of the day to go pick up their kids from school. Cisco supports it all. It would be extremely difficult to leave and lose all this flexibility. I plan to stay here as long as possible.",Nothing sticks out that is any different than working at any other company.

In recent years I have developed a visual impairment and my Cisco managers have been fantastic at getting me the support I need.","Over my 10 years at Cisco there has been a lot of reorganisation bringing changes to my role, team, managers.

Software engineering manager,3.0,"Apr 7, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco has a very big market cap and plenty of cash on hand.  They should be able to weather economic downturns very well.  Cisco provides free drinks, enables telecommuting and is very flexible on employee scheduling.","They are removing the free drinks and paid home ISP.  Cisco has lost its great culture that it had in the late 1990's, where all management and employees would do what was right for the customer, eschewing ulterior motives.  Their upper management is now so diluted with recent newcomers that old company bad behavior has crept in and trickled down.  Directors and VPs are not very trusted by the individual contributors and first line managers."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Sep 2, 2010",Current employee,"Interesting and exciting work.  The culture is unusual in Silicon Valley in that senior management takes input from anyone who wishes to share it, and then makes the decisions.  Everyone is expected to line up behind a decision once it's made.  This is a good thing, as there is no passive-aggressive behavior so common at other companies.  It's a great place to work if you are hard-charging and are willing to take risks.  Management backs you up when you do!  Also, Chambers is an outstanding CEO, who understands his employees and customers.  He is very highly respected within the company.","Comp is below market by design.  Management's view is that it's a privilege to work at Cisco, so employees should willingly take below-market comp.  Too many promotions go to cronies, without enough consideration to others."
Program manager,4.0,"Oct 31, 2010",Former employee,"Cisco has a good culture that promotes personal and professional growth.  There are plenty of opportunities to participate in professional development courses.  In addition, one can seek internal opportunities for a lateral move or even career advancement opportunities.","You will be working with many ""type A"" personalities.  It is very competitive.  There are only so many E+ and X performer ratings that can be handed out.  As a result, the manager is forced into an unfortunate position of designating bottom 10% even if the person is not truly an underperformer.  Also, be wary of internal corporate politics...  People who receive raises and promotions do not always merit those awards due to performance alone."

Promotions rare. They tend to recruit from outside (either department or outside cisco) - can be very demoralising. Take any promises when you are offered the job with a pinch of salt - get commitments in writing.
Slow pace - highly matrixed organisation.
Annual review process pointless and impact on annual bonus laughably small. 
Thousands of VPs, directors - doing what? No one I have asked knows. 
SanJose centric. So beware if not based there - the hard to get raises, promos and visibility just got a whole lot harder/impossible!

Cisco offers a trust-based work environment. You can work from anywhere on earth (many work from home) as long as you have internet access. Exciting, international project opportunities. I work in at least two different countries per month. I worked in the UK, Germany and USA during the last three weeks and am frequently provided with opportunities to facilitate workshops with senior leadership. We also give back to the community both financially and through community projects for those in need. Cisco staff are ""family"" and we live, work, give back and play together.

Cisco over rotated on performance reviews. Went from onerous do it yourself yearly dissertations that direct managers ""graded"" to informal sync-ups that largely get blown off or skipped because they are too unstructured. Cisco needs to rethink performance reviews so they get better performance."
Associate sales representative,5.0,"Dec 12, 2018","Current employee, less than 1 year","Amazing company with a strong reputation along customers, partners and competitors. Working at Cisco you make a statement in your career path by having joined one of the biggest IT companies around the globe and dealing with highly sophisticated technologies.

There is to mention especially the CSAP program, an industry-leading traineeship which applies to both, engineering and business graduates. The CSAP program provides you with a unique opportunity to dive into the world of advanced technologies and how to position them, as well as you will be confronted with real life cases and projects, making you a highly relevant employee for the company´s future plans.

Cisco also stands out with many different benefits, a great work-life balance and over-average salary in the IT industry.","Being a global player there are issues due to the company´s enormous size. Processes could be optimized, some tools lack usability and visibility could be increased."
Principal engineer,4.0,"Dec 30, 2018","Former employee, more than 3 years","The benefits are outrageously good.
The compensation is outrageously good.
If you are a survivor you will do well here.
If you are a high performer, you will do financially well here.
If you slack, you may actually do better than the high performers as management keeps the slackers around to cut them every 6 months when LRs are mandated.
When you are impacted by an LR and you will be, you earn a great exit package (I earned one year of base pay for 4 years of work...)
The DCP is pretty cool for 13/89s, but on reflection, if I knew Cisco was such an unstable company, I'd not had invested in the DCP program as now all my DCP is paid in one big chunk in one year instead of spread over several years as I had planned.  Live and learn :)","Cisco's definition of culture in my brief 4-year stint was ""everything is about money"".   That is good and bad - good because you can make some serious dough here, bad because there is no sense of community in the workforce.

Cisco has limited restructurings in spring and fall.  The lifers refer to avoiding a layoff as ""being safe"" which is in my mind an oxymoron.  There is no such thing as safety at Cisco.  If you come here, be prepared to move on when you hit the wrong set of cost lists.  High performance is no guarantee of ""safety"" either; I earned 1.3x-1.5x multipliers on my bonuses every year for 4 years - still impacted by an LR.  Most restructuring affects older (highly compensated) workers.  There is no other logical conclusion to the restructurings than they are meant to cut already well-trained long-term growth employees and replace them with a younger untrained workforce.  These LRs create intense stop energy in the company nearly all the time as everyone is in a state of panic.  This ""Fog of War"" is difficult for innovators to execute in making Cisco pivot like an Exxon Valdez rather than an Eagle.

Cisco completely doesn't understand open source and evidenced by the latest round of LRs in 2018 that impacted nearly every engineer doing any sort of open source work.  The engineering workforce is far too compliant resulting in high degrees of passive-aggressive behavior rather than assertiveness."
Associate account manager,5.0,"Sep 24, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","Cisco Sales Associate Program is a great chance for new graduates/young professionals to start strong career path. I was a part of it as a Sales Representative. During the year Cisco was massively investing in my learning and development, both sales and technical. We had professionals and coaches working with us from all over the world, best in class. The most important thing is to stay active and absorb this year as much as possible.
Moreover I was having several mentors from my country and from the hub, whom I could always ask for help and additional explanations.
Not to forget one of the most fun part of the year - is that I met a lot of knew people with whom we spent most of the time traveling, hanging out. Some of those people became very good friends of mine.",Moving to another country or even continent for the whole year was difficult for someone.

Technical consulting engineer,3.0,"Jul 18, 2021","Former employee, more than 3 years","The environment and people in the office are very friendly, always trying to help you, and because most of them are very knowledgeable technically, you have a lot to learn from your peers.

The salary is not the best on the market. Salary increase is done based on performance, but cannot keep up with the market. The only way you might be able to get a decent salary increase, is to tell your manager you are leaving, and at that moment is anyway too late.
Career growth is also latent. If you want to get a promotion, you need basically to work 2-3-4 years at the next level, and MAYBE you will get promoted."

It's a fantastic place to continue to hone your technical skills, and what better place to do it then at the company that made the router ubiquitous. Some may say that Cisco has become slow or unresponsive as it's gotten bigger, but I never worked in a company with so many people willing to go above and beyond for you and/or the customer. You won't get as many stock options as you would at a start-up, but Cisco stock is actually worth money.","It really depends on what your position is in Cisco.

While there is nothing wrong with rolling the dice with a company and growing with them, problems arise when the growth ceases.

- Overall the work culture and environment is nice, some groups may have shorter release cycles than others, which means faster pace. 
- Encourage work from home.
- Lots of internal tools for day to day activities that includes IT support and others.","- You may notice some political issues in bigger groups.
- Newer projects will have too many deviations  and lack of focus by management sometimes.
- If there is a cutting edge new project, there are some senior people who would want to associate with it just to get some visibility. 
- Reorgs are frequent.
- Some groups can be resistant in using the latest cutting edge technologies.
- Cross team collaboration is often political and unpleasant."

I'm proud to work at  Cisco, and would (and have) recommended Cisco to friends an family.",A lot of process which is required at times but not always.  Cisco is a very slow moving machine.

Project manager,3.0,"Jan 28, 2015","Former employee, more than 5 years","Has to be the ability to work from home, and just get on with the work.","- Sales culture: sales is very powerful and gets its way a lot of the time. As a result you're prevented from doing your job properly. For example, project managers can't exercise change control, because it'll upset the customer, and therefore potential future sales!

- pay: if you're a worker you don't get pay increases or promotions. It's the managers who get the promotions.

- job security: routers and switches had their heyday in the 90s, so now Cisco has to reduce its cost base, which means layoffs.

- Poor management: most managers are routing and switch guys, so that's the work they go after. They can't do the managed services like Ericsson, Nokia and IBM, etc. Net result is the type of projects are poor."

Terrible hiring practices ensures mediocre talent pool - stunningly poor in some cases. Substitutes ""going through the motions"" for ""getting results"" as primary goals - lots of meetings, emails, powerpoints, committees and so on.

Great package of benefits.","Being remote from SJC or RTP can make you invisible. Compensation growth is very limited. 

Sales reporting sucks, making commissions tracking very difficult, and if there's a mistake, good luck getting it corrected. When 'unknown' is the top selling partner in a region, you tend to question all the reporting. 

Politics, politics, politics! If you aren't a suck-up, you'll never advance. 

Intense focus on hitting Wall Street expectations for EPS has led to ridiculous T&E budgets. No way to do your job if you are grounded from being front of customers or partners."

I advanced my career at Cisco by moving to more senior positions and eventually management. Cisco sponsored me to obtain my MBA. The compensation and benefits package is generous.  I have learned a lot and appreciate the opportunities afforded me to develop myself and contribute in new ways.","As a large company, it can sometimes feel hard to get things done, but there is a focus to change that in the last 6-12 months and into the future.  At senior levels, there isn't a lot of room for advancement, and moving between teams, although encourage and even expected, seems to rest solely on the individual.  Lastly, yearly reorganizations seem to waste time and resources, will yearly layoffs drag on the culture."

Great compensation, benefits and flexibility. Had a great time in the departments prior to my last. Not sure if the people or Cisco changes but they've lost site of the people side of the culture.","Very political. Advancement and recognition became more about playing games and saying the right things rather than performance. They've missed several product cycles in their datacenter products and are beginning to lean heavily on reputation and fear, uncertainty, doubt instead of strong technology conversations. They have reached an over-saturation of product offerings and they aren't able to discuss in valuable detail the value of any one solution."

2. a large number of jobs at Cisco are going off-shore so be prepared to repeatedly prove that your skills cannot be outsourced without a serious loss to the product/team/bottom line
3. highly political organization & lots of disinformation ... assume you really do NOTknow what is going on even if you are being given information 
4. contractors are treated very poorly, even if they provide a big value add to the organization

- After 2 years if you are lucky, you may get 2 to 8% hike. Next hike will come again after 2 years and that too will be the same percentage. 
- New joiners (or even college freshers) will get almost 50% to 60% higher salary than 6 to 7 years experienced person who is performing well and getting good appreciation. 
- HR making so many rules for compensation or salary normalization but there will be always no budget to implement it."
Business development manager,5.0,"Feb 26, 2019",Current employee,"Although a  massive company with lots of moving parts, I've had opportunities and experiences that I can't imagine having at too many other companies between global travel, leading cutting edge initiatives, and paving the way for business that has never been done before because Cisco invented it.   

Futhermore, I love the culture.  It supports people first rather than the job role.  Cisco has a ""people deal"" that puts that culture into policy.  I've always had management that has supported my individual growth and cared for me as a person more than what I produce.  I appreciate that.","It is a big machine, so as agile as Cisco tries to be, it just isn't possible in a company this size with more than 60k employees.   

Promotion is hard to come by without jumping to another role one grade level up.  That said, there are tons of opportunities to move roles... even change careers within Cisco."

There is a sense of satisfaction when you enter your bank branch or hospital or hotel or stadium and see Cisco phone on the table or AP on the ceiling :) Corporate events are fun and frequent. Great collaboration products let you connect and stay in touch with your remote team around the globe and have a quite dynamic balance of where you work from: home, office or on the go.",In transformation and future few years will define if the company will exist on the market or not. The road can be bumpy.
Senior it manager,1.0,"Jan 12, 2022","Current employee, more than 5 years","Cisco is big on diversity. As they hire, they focus on bringing in diverse candidate pools, and

Culture has taken a VERY negative downturn in the past 3 months. Lots of new management changes that highlight how little they care about their employees. There is no support for others. Everything is through the lens of how ""I"" look to my leaders. 

I would not recommend anyone become a people manager. This role comes with all the blame and none of the reward. You will be expected to constantly push your team for results, work harder with fewer resources, and try to keep spirits up in a team that isn't rewarded for their work."

It's just (unwritten) expected, because otherwise it would be considered as business delivery not completed. Doesn't matter if the business delivery is a job for 2 or 3 people. If you are not careful, you might end in a sort of hell where your life is 100% connected with your work. This causes burnout.

- No acknowledgement for hardwork, no recognition. No Hikes, no timely Bonus and promotion. 
- lots of Politics in the group. You can survive only if your manager likes you. 
- No professional behavior in some team. People including manager dominate their language in the team and they like employees who speak their native language. Diversity in the group is not respected.

It has become a frustrating place to work, with many competing internal business objectives - product teams, services, and sales organizations are bloated, seeking new revenue and growth and the overlap is counterproductive.

Work options are flexible, it is possible to work from home when necessary.  Also there is some flexibility in choosing work locations (depends on position), or working from other company offices worldwide temporarily.

Medical benefits cover the whole family for full-time regular employees (but not for contractors).  Higher grades benefits also include either car allowance, or corporate car.  

Multi-national and multi-cultural environment at work.  All vacations and PTO are respected very carefully, people are not called on vacations.

In case of staff reduction, compensation packet (salary for a few month) is paid.","Getting a promotion (grade increase) in Cisco is very difficult and very slow.  You need some outstanding achievements beyond your normal work responsibilities to get it.  I got mine after 4 years there.  Not many people got it event after many years of employment.

In customer support organization (TAC), you will have pretty narrow and specific area of expertise, knowing only the thing you support and nothing else.  This would cause real difficulties when you want move anywhere from the support (even within the company).  Narrow scope of expertise is not demanded in modern world, and you will need to take your own efforts to make it wider, if you want to get another job.

When Cisco thinks it needs staff reduction, it takes it easy.  If specific persons or team are no longer matching current business needs of the company, they are dismissed quickly."

The company lost its innovative culture and commitment to its workforce in developing new technological advancements.

Results-based bonus compensation.,"Travel was insane - expected to hop on a flight at a moment's notice even to international destinations. This was very disruptive to the family. Also, when it came time to layoff 7,000+ employees, Cisco cancelled unvested stock, which was a significant amount of equity unfairly taken back. Stock bonuses were awarded based on past performance and vested as an incentive to keep the employee at Cisco. When Cisco changed course under new management, they should have let us keep our stock that we earned. Canceling our equity awards was an unethical move in my opinion. The company changed for the worse after John Chambers retired."

Software engineer iv,5.0,"May 27, 2012","Former employee, more than 8 years","Don't get me wrong: I didn't hit my 7 figure net worth via stock options but rather the generous compensation from Cisco (and being thrift personally helped as well). Cisco does make you work for your money but it is well worth it because of all the vast networking knowledge you'll acquire while working for them (especially in the IP domain). I've worked at various companies before Cisco and I really have to say that this is THE best company so far that I've work in.

Of course, YMMV.","Some projects, in the end, really are money losing projects which Cisco still maintain because it wants to have a footprint on those particular networking technologies. However, Cisco does recognize this and will make sure not to spend any more $$$ than it already has.

Too much corporate culture and seems like independent business units are always competing too much and not in a good way.

Cisco is always growing to new fields and markets, so there are always chances to transfer to do different work if so desired.",Cisco is a big company so decision making and project progress can be slowed. This is especially true when a project involves 2 or more business units and priorities between the two business units are not always aligned to the same schedule.

Plus, Cisco has limited market growth and is too big for it's own good; whether it's in cloud, SDN, or Unified Communications, Cisco is the gorilla in the room that leverages its vast install base to get sales vs its product-set. Considering it is such a big company, it's very difficult to move up in the organization, leading to a culture where everyone struggling to exceed last year's $50B revenue mark and only the luckiest sales teams reap the rewards."

There does not seem to be a universal direction, as every team and department works so differently, and propagating a proposed transition throughout the entire organization is a difficult thing to do.

No growth: you have to be super in charge of your career in order to get something out of your job.
Duplicating work: you see two teams working on the same thing all the time.  They need to lay off a lot of people to clean up this place.
Layers: way too many layers of management. Mind boggling that there are so many VPs with 0 direct reports.
Working remotely: you can work from home for months and talk to people on the phone without knowing what they look like. way to boost morale.
Work environment: old grey cubes, empty most of the time because of their working remote policy. 
Age of employees: very hard to find young people there.  You always see lots of people in their 40-50 stuck at the individual contributor level too."

They also have super fragile egos and fire people for simply knowing more than they do.","Having Cisco on your resume used to be a huge strength.

From hardware design standpoint, we are given opportunities on par with what happens at San Jose, maybe with a 1-2Q delay but good work does eventually reach our shores.  The management is transparent top down and recognitions are promptly awarded where due. Pay is on merit and merit is greatly valued with limited scope for internal politics and cronyism.

Besides working hard, Cisco also makes sure that the work/life balance is good. They do this by organizing regularly drinks, parties and family events such as Sinterklaas and a summer BBQ.  Besides that we have a yearly sales event in Vegas, this truly shows that the management want to invest in us to keep up our knowledge and get excited for the new fiscal year.",At the end of the quarter it can be very busy with regards to reaching your and your team's target.

I transitioned into a new role in a time when things were settling from a restructure, in a team with a new, very politically motivated leader, and the people involved in my hiring jumped ship and found new roles internally and externally. I really felt like the company let me down, as I kind of got lost in the shuffle, despite my efforts to speak up. If I had stayed in my original role, or if the timing had been better, I think I'd likely still be employed there.

Everything requires so much cross-functional alignment and agreement that nothing is ever decided and implemented.  Many projects in my division have been ongoing for several years without real progress...simply re-organizing and re-naming initiative something new without business results.

Software engineer iii,2.0,"Dec 3, 2012","Former employee, more than 3 years",Can live your own life without being bothered too much... Availability of internal training which would otherwise be very expensive. Very good medical benefits.,"Cisco is just too big. Most of the people are career hungry, but there's little opportunity to grow for 99% of the people that are there. It's a mostly Indian company (in my team of 20, there were 18 indians) and they just work differently from most of the other American companies.

They try to put a lot of pressure on engineers; I thought a company like cisco would go for the ""correct"" solution rather than the quick hack. False.

In Cisco, staying at the office 10 hours is better (i.e. gives you more visibility) than staying at the office 8 hours and be REALLY productive. It's all about ""cover your ass"". Not my ideal job."

Changing jobs internally is encouraged and necessary to prevent stagnation. World class benefits. Outstanding high level leadership, middle management less so.","Too often there are simply too many people on projects and in meetings which hinders ownership, accountability, and progress. While pay is in line with industry and geographic location advancement and compensation increases are very hard to come by which is the nature of such a large organization. You can move around to different roles across the company fairly easily but that doesn't really translate to pay increases or promotions. Global nature of teams and work means meetings will cut into personal time. Company is highly San Jose centric - partly understandable but no less frustrating at times for those in remote locations."

Those that want better promotions... to where? So they can also be ""useless"" middle managers?  Technology companies need people that can actually build stuff.

This is due to the company treating all teams as their own startup.  The good is that it allows teams to build and identity and business for themselves, the bad is that when resources are scarce, the political games begin and rather than collaborate, you end up with multiple versions of the same product or service with varying degrees of quality.

Lack of structure or structure that is not properly defined.  Your success is dependent on the manager you get.  No longer looking to hire experience, only looking to rent it."

In addition to regular PTO, employee are given 40 hours of PTO per year designated to volunteering for the community, and Cisco will give $10 to the organization for every hour and employee volunteers.

Also, depending on the team you’re working on - you may be overwhelmed and/or working on projects that are busy work/ not FULLY meaningful to the company unless you’re higher up.

They are squeezing people's ability to work as they used to. They have reorganized into a silo'd organization that does not allow any freedoms to work without the beaureaucratic bs. The way they do reviews is certainly not fair especially when it is tied to your bonuses. They compare you to each other and not how you have performed against your annual goals.

It also offers good work-life balance.,"Unfortunately upper management proved that they had lost their vision. Time and again they have gone into senseless reorganizations that created lots of churn but little tangible results. It was in an eternal confusion between growth and value. Countless resources were squandered into new adventures, which either didn't generate the kind of revenue to lift the company's ""growth"", or became obsolete before realization because of newer trendier fab. Overall, Cisco was no longer the market leader but has rather become the follower. Given its size, chasing after new ""fab"" isn't exactly the best exercise.

Fast paced, great comp and benefits","Recent years have seen a shift in corporate culture.  Thought Cisco has always been focused on profit and growth it was always done with the employees in mind.  Recent pressures of the stock holders and the IT market have seen a shift to more main stream corporate operating cultures.  Lay-offs are more common in Cisco now and there is less alignment between what the CEO ""says"" is the focus and what is actually executed.

The people I worked with really made me feel appreciated too, and that was a huge plus.","While I got good experience and lots to talk about in interviews, I don't know how much my work actually helped the company. Near the end of my internship I got the feeling that the interns from the year before had done the exact same projects we were assigned to do, making it almost feel like our time was wasted.

Employees are free to work from home whenever they want, there are no inconveniences to request permission to go out to solve personal issues, that is Cisco is very flexible.",In Cisco sometimes there are many strategic changes at the organizational level and this causes employees not to be clear business objectives and it is also possible that by these changes one group of employees has a manager and another manager another month.

It's different to be in Cisco Mexico, small offices, with little culture of integration, I assume is different if you are in RTP or San Jose. Work shifts varies and it is really hard to balance your personal life with your work. Managers won't trust you easily to get you new projects and experiences.

Too much process. Also, too many new hires in terms of recent college grads. Over a half of them are not even worth hiring. If the BUs were given a choice to hire people, I am sure, more than half of them would be rejects."

It seems like once you 'get made' (like in the mob) going from contractor to employee...you're in the inner circle and get the respect, periodic salary increases and benefits that a company of this size can provide.  If you're a contractor...you're in a dead end position and will have to fight hard for any increases in your pay rate...and even then they can take it away, blaming it on the economy."
Tech lead,1.0,"Oct 20, 2011",Current employee,"good coworker, some good technologies good engineers","Cisco now is place great for middle level manegement and up (director and up).

Cisco now is all about manage up, what your manager's preception of you is all that matter. Even if you suck but your manager like you, you will be fine. 
This manage up culture is a chain reason, stupid decision from the no clues extreme ambitous executives trump any grassroot common sense. That's why Cisco sucks so much in the last 2 years.

Agile and young, we used to make smart, strategic decisions. Smart acquisitions. It used to be fun. We're going on nearly a decade of indecisive leadership, unreasonable changes, lack of strategy, and all our decisions seem to be based on politics. It feels as though we've lost our competitive edge in the market and employees across the company are feeling its de-motivating effects. Pulse scores are low, opportunity is low, morale is low."

I just always imagined the execs would be so busy and wouldn't really interact with those of us who are lower in the company.  How wrong could I be?  They are so down to earth and always willing to talk and to help in any way.,Sometimes it may be hard to figure out how to advance in a company so big so I'd just say to always talk with management about your goals and get a mentor that will help you as well.
technical leader i,4.0,"Jun 15, 2008",Current employee,Being a relatively big company and including a great number of different business units Cisco offers lots of opportunities to be exposes to different technologies. As an financially successful company Cisco offers stability and nice (but not great) compensation and benefits package. Between so big number of employees it is easy to find many of really smart ones though the average level is not that high.,"Cisco is devoting lots of focus to protecting legacy products and, in some sense, it puts breaks to innovation drive and presents some inertia of thinking. Managers are generally competent technically but the level of politics vs. awards for taking rsk for the decision makes managers to go on the safe side."
Technical leader,4.0,"Jun 24, 2008",Current employee,Cisco has great benefits and is phenomenal at promoting flexible work.  Cisco empowers employees to innovate and be creative; to take charge of finding solutions for problems.  If you are a self starter it is easy to have an interesting job.,"There are a HUGE amount of politics going on.  Secrets, backstabbing, unfair promotions.  It is a very competitive environment.  Some groups have way too much process and others not enough.  It's easy to get lost in the shuffle."
Program specialist,4.0,"Jul 7, 2008",Current employee,"This is a very good company to work for as far as large corporations go. People are generally treated with respect (although there are always exceptions) and the culture is nice - teamwork oriented, etc. The benefits are pretty good.","No regular raises since 2001 - it is possible to get ""equity adjustments"" but very difficult. Even top performers tend to go a year or two between these ""adjustments."" In terms of salary, loyalty is not rewarded - it is very common for Cisco to hire externally at higher pay grades than the internal people who have been there for a long time - and the external hires do not necessarily have more experience overall."
Program manager,1.0,"Jul 18, 2012","Current employee, more than 10 years","Cisco had some good medical benefits, but they went away.  They had a good stock option plan, but that went to the mangers and the senior leadership team.  They had a good stock grant plan when you got promoted, but that is all under water and can't remember when I had a promotion in 7 years.","It's like reality TV, let's have another re-org to protect the management or give someone more people to build their empire.  To many Directors who produce nothing.  There are managers who have no reports to manage.  It's not what you know or do, it's how much your boss enjoys your company.   Cisco would make an excellent Survival TV show.  Or maybe not, no one would belive the nonsense that goes on here."

Constant re-organizations, you are told, not asked, what you new position will be.   Vice Presidents surround themselves with allies and the allies surround themselves with allies.  You need to be in San Jose and in the right building to get promoted.  A lot of full-time yet part time workers, do the minimum to stay hidden."
Director sales,3.0,"Jun 16, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Cisco is a market leader and makes it easy to get appointments with client stakeholders.  Cisco has a lot ot offer in the marketplace and has a stellar reputation.  Cisco offers a lot of flexibility to the employees along with providing access to all of the technology needed to be efficient in getting the job done.  Additionally, Cisco offers the opportunity to work from home to most employees.","Cisco is a large company and very popular to work for and this makes it surprisingly difficult to land opportunities for advancement or compensation increase (as it almost seems as though Cisco just figures if x person doesnt stay, then they can always hire a replacement).  Additionally, there is a lot of bureaucracy making it difficult to get decisions made quickly to transact business."
Software engineer ii,5.0,"Jul 8, 2014","Former employee, more than 1 year","Cisco's TLs will floor you with their humility despite the wealth of knowledge and insight they carry. For a Grade 4-6, the learning can be phenomenal if tuned properly.  John Chambers is an amazing CEO - such a great visionary. He has lead Cisco steadfast through difficult times and given focus/resources to the right areas to solve Customer problems.","Execution maybe ? Given the size of Cisco, it is hard to disagree that things move relatively slower at Cisco than at other smaller companies in the same domain. It can get annoying to a Cisco employee when ""spin-ins"" are funded despite the treasure trove of technical expertise and ability to execute within. Fixing this malaise could potentially work wonders!"

Anonymous employee,1.0,"Jan 21, 2017",Former employee,Laser focus on customers-partners has always been embedded in the company's DNA.,"Constant layoffs-  dismissing senior technical talent who are loved by their customers  and/or are recognized in the industry; gross mis-steps in cloud;  a toxic environment of fear has set into various organizations because of these sudden dismissals especially when the company is profitable.

- Breadth and depth of senior-level engineering talent is incredible.
- Plenty of money available to spend and so many initiatives can get funded (at least until initial field trials).","- Extremely mid-heavy (director and senior director levels), sometimes with zero direct reports.
- As is the case with most employers, HR is an necessary evil. Stifling stack ranking culture.
- Pay is less than competitive. Raises and promotions are not merit-based.
- Company-wide layoffs (aka ""restricted restructuring""), RIFs, downsizing every 15-18 months with clock-like regularity. This happens on a massive scale globally, affecting the US predominantly."
Global account manager,3.0,"Aug 5, 2019","Former employee, more than 1 year",Own a huge part of the networking pie. Some cool leading security products. Still many good people left.,Many legacy managers. Old school weekly pipe submissions. Managers have no clue on cloud and blame current employees for their inability to transform the business. Reps are to own executive relationships as managers have none. They are very dependent on refresh of technology. Want premium money for subpar support. Many people leave and do not get paid what they are owed. I have asked multiple times for detail on payouts and it goes to 3rd party that will not even give you an email to respond to. Fewer and fewer are hitting their numbers.I left as only one over plan on my team and didn’t even have an exit interview.
Senior product manager,3.0,"Oct 10, 2019","Former employee, more than 8 years","Great place to learn the art of Product  Management. You get a very rounded experience of all aspects and get significant ownership of a product, not just its pieces. Cisco trained Product managers do very well in the industry. Work life balance is good.","Cisco pays lesser than Bay Area average. The Service Provider Networking Group I worked in was simply political and toxic. Favoritism and clique culture was rife. Things were done simply to make people feel bad. I was also discriminated against because I was a woman with a voice and an opinion. I used to hear stories of  how the ""old boys gang"" used to get together over drinks and trash the women in the team."

- There is some flexibility with work/life balance in that you can work a 40-hour week if you get your job done and can choose when you come to work and leave, but if you expect any type of promotion, work must be your life
- Too many constraints and stringent processes causes a lack of innovation and creativity"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jun 21, 2011",Current employee,"There are still some great people at Cisco, although because of process and politics the people don't have the ability to influence change like they used to.  You can learn a great deal from the people who have been around for a while.","There are hundreds of directors at Cisco with no reports.  The company is so executive and management heavy that its mind boggling.

Lots of talent and smart people are leaving the company.  More and more average Joes joined.  Lots of managers, directors, and VPs. Too much middle layer management.

Product manager,1.0,"Oct 9, 2013","Former employee, more than 1 year",Flexibility to work remotely makes a huge difference.,"Perhaps this was the most nightmarish experience I have had in a big company. It's sad that Cisco had such fat cats sitting and just taking bad decisions for business to suit their personal ambitions for promotion.

Politics and lack of people with proper skills  - that should sum it up. Nobody really cares about doing good work. All they care is ""how do I keep my manager happy"" so they can keep their job.

There can be good compensation package and benefits.,"There are some opportunities for movement laterally to different departments to get a well rounded experience, but it's difficult to get recognized for your work and hence be promoted. Your experience here will greatly change with what direct manager you have. Because of increasingly stressed resources, employees are asked to do ""above and beyond"" as a standard so the work life balance can easily tip to work. High level of complexity in departments, organization, products and solutions causes a bit of chaos and again, difficulty tracking performance."

There is such a large staff and so many contractors, you've got a choice: grab on and hold tight, be an overlap, or be laid-back.  Although this exists in many companies, Cisco is the poster child."

Many Cisco lifers are passionate about what they're working on, but some seem to be along for the ride, only to do the minimal amount of work necessary (I'm sure most large companies experience this).

Poor mid-level managers who have been at Cisco for eons and are more concerned with managing up. Very passive aggressive culture.

Transport facilities are really nice.","Hikes might be bit disheartening if you are a top performer.
Cisco does regular layoffs of entire orgs if they do not perform over a period of time. This might be a issue of concern if you land up in an underperforming product.

Great place for women as the management encourages gender balance in senior roles.  Strong focus on diversity. Good communication in general","The company went through a huge amount of change, there was little stability in people's roles, which sometimes encourages short-term thinking. Pressure can be very high in sales roles. Many roles overlap in responsibilities, so there are always multiple stakeholders and interested parties to manage"

In effect, often times there are multiple teams doing the same thing. And then, it becomes ugly as to who should stay. 

A ripple effect is that there are little accountability. Projects are often offloaded to India and then quality takes a deep dive. Support is often lacking because they simply didn't have the complete picture. Bugs are often closed or workarounded instead of fixed at the root."

I'm very impressed by the caliber of thought and care given to making Cisco a safe place to work.","In our discussions about the rights of LGBT employees, we are well aware of the differences in experience country to country.

I meet people every day who bounced around jobs before landing and staying at Cisco. And also people who leave for greener grass on the other side, and come right back",Big company with associated complexities and messy back-end data sets; not a consumer brand so not recognized by students and prospective candidates - makes it harder than it should to hire top talent.
Csap,5.0,"Sep 23, 2019",Current employee,"- Great training that is interactive and fun

- Great pay!","- All large companies can sometimes give you the feeling of being just a number, and during commit calls that is a feeling. (If you actively build your network it isnt too bad)
- Typical stress of a sales job. Make sure you know your business and add pipeline!
- If you want upward mobility Cisco has it, but you will most likely need to be open to moving locations or segments if you want to continue going up the management chain"
Systems architect,5.0,"Sep 30, 2019",Current employee,Very competitive based + bonus + benefits package and great work and life balance. Flexibility to work from home.

Hardware engineer iv,4.0,"Dec 10, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is a company that is leading the way for the next generation of communications.  They have an excellent executive team that communicates a consistent vision down the reporting chain.  During the current struggles, they are adapting -- finding ways to reduce expenses without layoffs.   While there is some job loss at Cisco, I feel it is not as great as other companies.

Cisco also believes in a comprehensive compensation package, constantly checking the industry to ensure fair compensation.","During the downturn, decisions about letting folks go is not always based on performance, but geography.

This is done frequently and provides great opportunities for career growth.","The issue with Cisco is that if you don't work at headquarters in San Jose, CA, you are treated as a remote worker, even if you work at another major Cisco campus.  The issue here is getting appropriate facetime and leadership support."
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Apr 28, 2011",Current employee,Some of the new engineers (new graduates) put it this way.

Working from home is convenient and may be a wonderful option for young families.,"Internal politics and constant restructuring is the worse part of Cisco.  It can be very frustrating to constantly change direction.  There are long periods of no leadership during those upheavals.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 21, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","Been a while since I looked around but the salary and benefits seem competitive and the company embraces flexible working hours and locations.  Being a huge company, the market listens to Cisco giving opportunity to work with a variety of customers all over the world.",Software projects are distributed over too many global sites leading to inefficiency and frustration in taking and acting upon basic decisions.  Proliferation of management layers leads to disconnect between those setting strategy and the rest of the organisation.  Continual restructuring and an inability to redeploy workers appropriately leads to regular bouts of talented workers being let go (with corresponding impact on morale).
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jan 25, 2016",Former employee,"Huge company means plenty of resources to set up meetings and conferences, and so on. Suppliers return your call every time.

In the grand scheme of things, your work hardly matters. Or so it feels like. Somewhere, 6 levels above you, some EVP makes decisions and sends you an email, mostly congratulating himself on what a wonderful email he has written.

Director,4.0,"Sep 21, 2016","Current employee, more than 10 years","Great company with a sold reputation and loads of opportunity.

This can sometimes make it challenging to move forward big initiatives, and it often leaves employees feeling insecure.  That said, it does provide opportunities for new paths and growth."
Senior finance controller,4.0,"Dec 19, 2016",Former employee,"Fast paced.  Challenging.  Most finance people are very intelligent, knowledgeable and highly professional.  Teams typically are very collaborative and work to help all succeed.","You never know when Cisco will outsource your job, downsize or exit your business.  So all constantly worry when their last day will be.

Very little investment in training finance people.  Internal job rotation program is not actively managed well so movement is slow as people are afraid to change jobs for fear to lose their job.

Finance teams are a reporting function to enable management by numbers.  Finance organization needs to really and truly be value add to their business partners rather than managing their business partners like Monday morning quarterbacks."

There are many different types of products, so depending on what you're looking for, you could find a global role or a more of a startup feel depending on the business unit.

Some of the business units that play a supporting role in selling hardware or for making product that are not directly showing revenue tend to have less bonuses and continued layoffs.

Virtual sales account manager,5.0,"Jul 29, 2016","Current employee, more than 1 year","Please keep in mind that these observations are in regards to the Cisco Canada Sales organization. I had previously worked at IBM and Lenovo so my observations are in comparison to those companies.

- Great work culture: Excellent mix of young and old talent. Male to female ratio is 50/50. Culturally diverse workforce. Sales culture is the opposite of toxic - people genuinely celebrate in your successes and pick you up when you are having a rough quarter. The virtual sales team feels like a family and spends time together outside of working hours. The virtual sales team is also inclusive and no one is treated like an outsider (no ""clique's"")

- Great work/ life balance: 4 weeks paid vacation. Everyone packs up and leaves at 5pm. Work from home one day per week. A great culture of doing meaningful work, rather than trying to look busy and stressed. Paid volunteer days. The entire company shuts down for a week in August and goes to Vegas (this is in addition to your vacation days). The company also shuts down from Dec 23rd - 31st (in addition to your vacation days). 

- Opportunities for career growth: In the sales organization there is a very clear and defined path for career growth. Management has the career path conversation very early to set expectations. Every 6 months a batch of people are promoted from virtual (inside) sales to field sales. Average tenure is 2.5 years in virtual sales before being promoted to field sales. Cisco also has these amazing programs:
     - Ignite: Program that recruits young-in-career sales professionals from other industries and teaches them technology infrastructure sales from the ground up. These people come from industries that are completely different from technology infrastructure. 
     - Are you ready?: This program takes people from other Cisco business units (mainly operations), and puts them in a sales role. People who would traditionally not be able to break into sales are given the chance to try it out
     - CSAP: Cisco Sales Associate Program - This is a prestigious 3 year rotational program that recruits the top university graduates. Right out of school they spend the 1st year as an Associate Sales Rep (cold calling and learning sales). The 2nd year is spent as a Virtual Sales Account Manager (inside sales). And the 3rd year is spent as a Territory Account Manager (field sales). 

- Excellent tools and processes: ALL OF THE TOOLS AND PROCESSES WORK. Not only do they work, but a lot of the tools talk to each other. All of the processes are well thought out and clearly defined. There is never any guess-work on how to do something complex. Cisco has mastered the art of simplifying complex processes and executing quickly. I say this because at IBM it used to take weeks to get a simple task done. At Cisco it takes minutes. MINUTES.

- Best products in the industry: Cisco engineers amazing stuff. When I was at IBM, Cisco INVENTED a new datacenter product that massacred IBM's marketshare. IBM ended up selling their server business unit to Lenovo. Cisco has this same caliber of engineering in ALL of their architectures (switching, routing, wireless, datacenters, telephony, etc).

- Perks: FREE PARKING. Their office is at Bay and Queens Quay and they offer free parking for every employee. I don't think I have ever heard of a company downtown that does this!  Catered lunches 2-3 days a week. Annual education stipend to take courses outside of work. Awesome prizes and spiffs. They take over your personal cell phone plan so you pay $0 and get unlimited everything (data included). Amazing high-tech office with 360 degree panoramic views of downtown Toronto and lake Ontario. All expenses paid annual trip to Vegas for EVERY sales rep across the globe.

- Compensation: They are the highest paying vendor in the tech infrastructure industry. IBM paid well and when I came over to Cisco my new salary was a 63% increase from what IBM paid. I was so shocked by this that I started researching what the other vendors paid by asking around in my network. Cisco overshoots every other vendor by miles. Their sales quota's are attainable and the accelerators are bonkers when you over-achieve your quota.

- Good leadership: Management regularly asks the front line reps what is working and what is not working. They take this feedback and then execute changes to the overall strategy right away. It's almost scary how quick they execute and maneuver. Management doesn't play games with front line reps either, they communicate exactly what is going on and level set our expectations regularly. Another thing I like about them is that they actually know how to get things done. A lot of managers will say ""let me know how I can help"", but reps will rarely go to them because they might screw up a complex deal by jumping into it. Not at Cisco. These managers are veteran sales people themselves and know everything about the company. If you run into obstacles they WILL cut through red tape and help you close the deal.","Honestly, there are none. Everyday I feel lucky to work here."

- management may not be competent, depending on the project you are on; if so, their inability to connect software needs and abilities with business needs will frustrate you"

As part of the Global Virtual Sales organization, they fly us out to global sales training (has been most often held in Las Vegas, NV) not only to learn but also to meet the rest of our teammates based outside of our own locations; Cisco really focuses on career-pathing and opening their employees up to options within the company.","Cisco doesn't offer a travel reimbursement for highway-tolls, etc., but all-in-all that's the worst thing I can say."

Cisco retained my job and welcomed me back once the crisis was past.","Engineering-driven company with scattered UX practice and greatly varying levels of success.

Need to know with whom to be a friend in order to get a promotion. Everything depends on visibility how popular you are. Lack of transparency. Heard plenty of internal issues with managers: emotional distress, inequality. Employees afraid of talking about it loudly. Officially we were told to care of ourselves but due to the lack of a workforce, everyone is overloaded. Some managers don't allow to register overtime. So, you might land working 50h per week.

Furthemore, while the working remotely option is valuable, it is also abusive as it tends to also be an abuse of all-access to the employee and the expectation that they will work around the clock.

She actually continued to manage family members, who benefitted financially from outsourcing deals even after moving to her role as COO under new CEO. The new CIO is one of her watchdogs, who also is known to promote people based on racial agenda. He has no achievements and just a talking head.

Marketing,2.0,"Mar 6, 2017","Former employee, more than 8 years","Smart people, decent pay and benefits.","Very siloed positions, most people are under-employed since very talented people are hired into job silos that limit the full expression or development of their skills.  There are constant layoffs, accompanied by all of the unhealthy cultural by-products that come with layoffs: paranoia, lack of motivation, managers pitching smoke-and-mirror programs since you will never be held accountable to deliver based on the constant reorganizations and priority shifts, lack of trust.  Very talented senior leaders who have the confidence to speak the truth, name the dysfunction for what it is, and try to be agents for change are always the ones to announce they are 'pursuing other opportunities' (aka, forced out), leaving the sub-par leaders to run the ship."

Engineering program manager,4.0,"Jul 26, 2022",Current employee,"Cisco has been rated as the best employer anywhere in the world several times in recent years. The focus on culture quickly made me realize that I had been working in toxic workplace cultures for years without really realizing it.   Cisco attracts a huge depth and breath of talent, so are likely to working with some of the best minds in the industry.","As an engineering program manager joining Cisco, I was initially expecting a more process driven culture. Cisco has many product groups, some based on acquisitions. Every group seems to use a different set of tools, templates and documentation standards. This means there is a little bit more overhead in managing technical teams if programs bring together engineers from around the organization."
Serviceability design engineer,2.0,"Jun 27, 2008",Former employee,"The attitude of ""customer success"" is very prevalent within the company, so if you run up against a roadblock, using that magic phrase opens many doors.","In Customer Advocacy, there were no real opportunities for advancement unless you were willing to relocate to San Jose.  Benefit costs increased substantially every year, but there were no raises to be had.  Reorganization happened every 6 months, so I never had the same boss for one full review cycle.  Management was constantly trying to justify the existence of our group by adding supplemental job tasks to the job description, but failing to recognize and evangelize the inherent value of our core deliverables."
Systems engineer iii,4.0,"Jun 28, 2008",Current employee,"You are working with talented and driven peers in a  highly collaborative environment.

Few women in leadership positions. Lots of lip service on diversity but no real data is shared.

With limited raises and underperforming stock, it's not a good place to retire from unless you are in a senior management position.

Managers and above refer to themselves as ""your leadership team"" (ironic) and post their pictures on every email. And, of course, they are all wearing suits and ties. Individual advertisement and selling is a big time waster at Cisco. 

Innovation is not emphasized or rewarded. Instead, you have to learn to play the game well and know who to buddy up with."
Enterprise account manager,1.0,"Feb 5, 2010",Former employee,"Brand is highly regarded

Always able to get audience with customer executives.","What John Chamber's preaches is not reality in the trenches.  Sales Management are spreadsheet jockeys who are manic and frankly, emotionally frazzled by their fear of upper management.  I likened my experience in sales to the attributes of 3rd generation child abuse.  You manager was abused by his manager, so he abuses you because it is the ""way I was raised"".  A total lack of management ethics when the heat is on to hit a sales commit at the end of a month or a quarter.

My advice is to not be seduced by the ""Human Network"" but stay away from Cisco for your ""Human Sanity"""

Overall Cisco cares about their employees and what makes them happy.",Cisco only has a couple of negatives in my opinion. Performance reviews are slightly unfair but don't really harm you(meaning you are more likely to get average but that means good). Visiting HQ depends upon the team you work for and some teams never send people some limits visibility face to face (WebEx makes up for that a little but still would like to shake a hand from time to time.)

Program manager,1.0,"Mar 12, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year",They are supportive about flex time and telecommuting. Paychecks arrive as scheduled.,"There is no on-boarding.

For somethings you can call HR in California. The phone staff was always friendly & the on-hold times were ok. However, even at ok, altogether it'll make for very long first days.

There is no relocation assistance, so bargain hard for that signing bonus! 

I can only speak from my experiences, but in my opinion - Do not work for this company. Not unless you enjoy being bludgeoned out of your career by small-minded micro-managers. If you have another option, take it. I had options. And I chose Cisco! Dammit.

The salaries are decent, but with the flexibility added in, they become much better than the rest of their competitors.","Slow to act. I had a terrible manager who was around for 5 years too long however, senior leadership would not let him go until layoffs took place. The extra time he spent sticking around led to relationship break downs with stakeholders and talent moving onto other teams due to his poor leadership style. I feel that senior leadership does too little for their employees while they walk away with large salaries and bonuses."
Engineer,2.0,"Feb 1, 2014",Current employee,"Employees are genreally nice and friendly, great place to start out and learn about the IT industry, decent reputation","Stupid acronyms, over-inflated egos, Managers are AMATEURS, Contractors are treated like third class citizens, tons of bureaucracy.  Values Profits over Employees all day/everyday."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Apr 2, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years","Cisco operates at a scale and influence that exceeds any other place I've ever worked. You command a lot of respect from customers and partners, and the sales channel is amazing in its efficiency.","There are a lot of silos, making it hard to collaborate across parts of the business. (I had another product group refuse mine access to source code for a product they were discontinuing.) And a lot of deadweight - middle managers and engineers who had been at Cisco their entire careers and didn't have a perspective on the rest of the market. And the company's been seeking a new overall strategy for what seems like a decade now - with a stock price that reflects that."
Program manager,4.0,"Jun 3, 2015","Former employee, more than 10 years","Cisco is a great company to work for, I was fortunate enough to spend 15 great years with them.  They provided me with a good severance package and great support when I was laid off.","I missed the ""Start Up"" feel and mentality that Cisco had when I first started there.  While everyone talks about cross functional work and flexibility the work and hierarchy is still very siloed."
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Apr 3, 2016","Former employee, less than 1 year","Good pay, good benefits.  Free coffee.","Whatever you do avoid the projects that manage large numbers of servers.  Poor engineering of products.   Documentation is lacking.  In my job the debug / edit / compile cycle was approximately 1 hour (versus a few minutes at most other companies).   This is due to bad choices made in engineering, and the cost on current employees is very high.   

Cisco does not ""eat its own dogfood.""  So the complex task of managing hundreds of servers is not deployed at Cisco.  Furthermore, the company isn't willing to invest much in hardware.  You'll be forced to use ""simulators"" to debug things, being that there is no big set of hardware to use.

Also, if you are not Asian you may not ""fit in"".  Don't expect the other employees to be very friendly or helpful."
Customer success manager,5.0,"Nov 13, 2017","Current employee, less than 1 year","Great big company. Cisco culture is still on a personal level and that is a great quality!
Living far from the office, managements advice is to work from home. How good is that!

In the transition the company is in, there is a culture gap of traditional Cisco and the new Cisco."
Sales specialist,5.0,"Oct 8, 2018","Current employee, more than 1 year","I was a small company girl, last year my company was acquired by Cisco, in candor I was very concerned about working at such a large organization. I was pleasantly surprised by how inclusive and supportive the culture was. I have never felt that I had as many opportunities as I do at Cisco.

Of course it is also great to work for a company with as strong a brand as Cisco!

The other thing worth mentioning is that at Cisco our team is so strong that when I went on vacation this summer, I didn't have to work! Being in Sales that is a first for me.",Cisco is huge! That means sometimes the you have to deal with information overload.
Software engineer,1.0,"Feb 14, 2019","Former employee, more than 3 years","OK work-life balance, remote Work, some really cool people","Arrogant management, big focus on OPEX , the way company progres is by  running layoffs marathon every 3 months. There is no appreciation , people get fired if they have opinion different than manager and HR covers up all those cases. The leadership has no clue about the products they are asking engineers to build, things  getting build and scrapped and rebuild and to cover the failure its being presented as a learning curve (learning when everyone already knew it?)
The career opportunities do not exist. Pay is rather low compare to the market
Average benefits, few of them being taken away :(
There is few great people but the culture coming from the upper management is disgusting, saying you either with us or you should live ... not nery motivating on  convincing."
Product specialist,4.0,"Aug 1, 2019","Current employee, more than 10 years","Smart, hardworking peers. In general most employees are team players and looking to do the right thing.","The company is quite agile, which is how it has thrived for 30+years in high tech. Unfortunately this causes a lot of internal churn as departments and projects are spun up and spun down. Often  good people can get caught in a re-org. Company could do a better job of educating employees where talent will be needed so job transitions could be made without relying on  traumatic re-orgs."
Tech lead,5.0,"Jan 24, 2020","Current employee, more than 10 years","Feel like home because most of the leadership are Indian.
If you are Indian and on the right food-chain, you will move up faster because we have strong alley here.
Good balance of work and life.
We have extremely loyal customers.
Friendly environment to H1-visa holders.
Presentation and Talk is more important than building things because we buy instead of build.","Overall compensation is not as good as top tier companies like Google, FB.
However, hourly rate is better than Google, FB because on average you work less than 6 hours because most of the products are extremely mature.
Take around 6+ years to get a green card.
Annual layoff.
Luckily, most of time they don't cut H1-visa holder.
Too many reorg, sometimes it takes longer to move up."

Hardware engineering intern,4.0,"Jun 24, 2008",Current employee,It has an up and coming internship program that seems focused on attracting new hires.  If you are able to take part in the Cisco choice program you are given a decent level of flexibility in choosing which group you would like to work for.,It is a large company and it seems like it would be hard to advance positions.  I think this is a characteristic of most tech companies though.  I have been told the best way to get a raise or advance is to get a job at another company.
Manager,4.0,"Jan 6, 2009",Current employee,There are very good people at Cisco and comitted to customer success.  The senior management is smart and understands the business.  Benefits are good and overall compensation is on par with the industry.  There are different opportunities to learn and grow in different technologies.  Cisco is the leader in shaping the way the world communicates.  It will be a great company for a long time.,"Promotion opportunities are limited.  You either have to have been here over 10+ years or have come in at the level you feel you are working at.  Once inside, unless you have a guardian, performance with a combination of ability will not you get you very far."
Senior software engineer,1.0,"Aug 17, 2009",Current employee,"Flexible work schedule depending on your immediate manager -- but if you are expected to work 20 hours -- does it really matter?
It might be possible to use your time spent at Cisco in lieu of course work towards Political Science degrees.","Not a technology-oriented company.
Not many US educated employees, nor many people with advanced engineering degrees.
Employees are usually Indian with a typical background (Indian education from unknown universities); get on the boat using India Consultancy Inc.; jump ship to Cisco and hang around there for a long time to become part of management -- continue hiring new people off the boat -- build empires and bask in the glory of sycophants."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"May 8, 2011",Former employee,"You'll enjoy workplace flexibility, team work, competitiveness, good salaries, travel, diversity and a great high tech learning environment.  Besides you'll make a lot of good friends.

On-site gym and medical facility are hard to beat.   Don't forget to get your free light rail pass in you take a HQ job,"budget cuts force employees to always keep their heads up for positioning of new projects that will continue to get funding.   At times this type of rapid change drives inefficiency as teams don't get their heads down to do work like they could if they trusted their mgmt had their backs.   the tough part is even mid level mgmt gets surprised by budget cuts, so it can make it a tougher place to work these days."
Software engineer ii,5.0,"Nov 17, 2014","Current employee, more than 5 years","The Product design and development was so clear as i[senior developer] was literally involved with many stakeholders like Program management, Customer Facing Engineers, Product Test teams etc. Further my duration of stay[4 years] helped me understand in-and-out of the PowerKey Solution. Thus i was able to handle all customer issues as well. Travelled to OCN Shanghai, China and Den,Delhi on Cisco business trips.","Actually the overall time that you spend in Cisco Systems adds to your professional portfolio and increases the experience of how big multinationals work and deliver solutions to client.

Changing this can be difficult and must be fought for. Management changes can be frequent (3 in about 16 months) and political which can lead to a feeling of misdirection.

Associate sales representative,3.0,"Apr 22, 2008",Former employee,"The Associate Sales Representative program is a training program that ultimately feeds into Cisco System's sales force.  You are trained thoroughly for about 8 month.  Subjects of training include everything from how to be a more confident public speaker, to cold calling, to the obvious training on all of Cisco System's hardware and proprietary software.  You are divided into 'teams' within the ASR program and you do most everything during the work day with them.  You have a manager that is your 'team leader' and you have a tech manager who is responsible for teaching you the material on Cisco hardware as well as pointing out the relative strengths and weaknesses similar competitive products have.  The ideal end result of this program is to take a sales oriented person and tech him or her enough technical information so that this person could sit down in a meeting with a client and speak to a CEO, CFO, CTO and answer all of their questions with the caveat that really technical things will be covered by an Associate Sales Engineer (ASE) who is your more technically savvy counterpart.  Cisco's aim is to have ASRs and ASEs work as a team together.  This doesnt exactly work out because the ASR to ASE ration is conservatively skewed at 2 to 1 respectively.","I was a part of the Associate Sales Representative program, we are referred to as ASRs within Cisco Systems.  The problem working at Cisco is not the upper management or the training; I was very satisfied with those aspects of the job.  Your co-workers will make this a miserable experience.  The dynamics of the training program were worse than high-school.  We were provided with subsidized housing through Cisco and college graduates could not act appropriately.  Some were even kicked out of their leases.  

There were people skinny dipping in the apartment complex's pools, people egging other people's vehicles.  It is the farthest thing from a professional behavior you can imagine.

The sales staff of Cisco Systems is notoriously cocky and if you speak to anyone on the outside who deals with them on any sort of regular basis, they can confirm this.  The program is also set up like indentured servitude.  By which I mean, once you have completed the training program you are bound to work for them at a location of their choosing (ultimately it depends on your desirability as a Sales Representative and suitability to the area) for no less than 2 years.  If you quit before this period, you are required in your contract to pay them back a subsidized portion of your training."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Apr 1, 2015","Current employee, more than 5 years","IMPORTANT - Different divisions within Cisco are vastly different from one another, my advice is to make sure you know if a GlassDoor review is relevant to the job that you are applying to.

I work in the Collaboration Technology Group (CTG) which includes WebEx, TelePresence, IP Phones, Jabber and Spark (aka Project Squared).

The Pro's of CTG are:

(1)  Typically your co-workers are great people. My immediate team, for example, is one of the top group of peers I've had in my whole career. They are smart, qualified and everyone cares about each other

(2) The Collaboration Group has some really interesting products, there is a very good chance you'll work on something that is relevant and that you'll be proud to have on your resume 

(3) Cisco offers great benefits. I can almost guarantee you won't find a company that can beat what you get for being a full time employee (Medical, flexible work, 401k matching, etc)","The con's of working within the Collaboration Group:

(1) At the VP and Director level Cisco is competitive and tumultuous, more so than any company where I've worked in 20+ years. In the last 5 years there have been 4 different Senior Vice Presidents and with each change there has been a lot of churn and changing of priorities.

(2) There is a ton of in-fighting between groups (aka BUs or business units). Basically every Director and VP is incented to compete against ever other Director and VP for budget, resources, attention from executives & the sales force, etc). While this sounds normal for a large corporation, the stakes are high. Winners build set their own agedas and losers can not control their own products and often are subject to yearly layoffs. The bottom line is almost none of the teams are rowing in the same direction, rather everyone competes against each other. 

(3) Most importantly Cisco has a yearly layoff. Every July/August for the last 6 years the company lays off a large number of people. In that time the company has laid off more than 20,000 people and yet the number of employees is larger than ever.  I've seen entire product teams get cut when other teams could sorely use the talented people that were let go. I know someone who got an Outstanding yearly review (which is only given to 6% of people at Cisco), and he was laid-off just a week later. 

Normally you think of a large company as being more stable than a small one, but Cisco is not at all stable

(4) It's very hard at all levels to move up at Cisco. If you are a manager who wants to become a director it's very difficult, the best way to be a director at Cisco is to be at a company that Cisco buys. If you are a Tech Lead who wants to become a Senior Tech Lead the competition is fierce - I know several engineers that have been trying for years to make the next step."

(2) Immigrants who need visa & green card sponsorship based on employment
(3) Lazy engineers who do not want a progress in technology and career
(4) Ass kissers who enjoy spending 90% of their time on office politics.","Cisco is very successful in marketing for hardware devices, but has a very bad and extremely expensive way for management.  Try to develop innovative software product here is so tough, just like a ""group constipation"": Many people works very hard on it, and takes very long time, and it turns out little -- s**t. They keep on deliver software product which makes little or no money and abandon it later, and no one say any thing bad inside Cisco for those garbage software products except their customers. Cisco has to use their famous strategy : keep on buying good technology from other company, to make up this shortage. 
Cisco's performance system over require so called leadership & influence no matter what your position is and how much you actually need it. This encourages people  spending too much time on virtual work, spending endless time on meeting, phone calls, writing emails and not much useful documents. The more time you spend on real solid work, the less time you may spend on increasing your ""visibility"" or ""influence"", and worse performance you will get. My whole team was acquired by Cisco from another company. In my previous company, my performance never drop below top 15% for a few years, but in Cisco, with the same boss, same team members, same kind of excellent  project I lead and accomplished, my performance drops under average. Cisco is full of mediocre engineers. The reason is not because they hire mediocre engineer but they make their engineers mediocre, they are encouraged and forced to be mediocre. If you stay long enough in Cisco, you will probably become mediocre even you are excellent before, and you will find it is hard for you to find a decent job outside again with what you learn in Cisco.

Lot's of opportunity to rotate jobs. Good work/life balance and ability to work remote.,Very difficult to get raises.  Make sure you come in at a grade level that you are comfortable with for several years because it can be tough to get grade level promotions.  You may be subject to layoffs every 1-2 years that may not be tied to your performance.
Cse,2.0,"Oct 25, 2013","Former employee, more than 5 years","Good pay, good people, good benefits","Cisco thought they knew video better than the company they bought (Tandberg). They then proceeded to try and push the market where they wanted to go, not where customers necessarily wanted to go. The trickle of ex-Tandbergers turned into a flood, and there you have it (again), a great company ruined by the Behemoth that is Cisco.
The yearly layoffs, the overlap between Bu's (and constantly rearranging Bu's, what a mess!"

Anonymous employee,4.0,"Nov 1, 2014","Current employee, less than 1 year",Work life balance is great. The company is very understanding of your home life and most jobs allow you with the flexibility of working from home. I was located at the RTP office and the campus is very nice.,If your expecting a high impact challenging environment this place may not be for you. While the work is stimulating it is definitely not like working at other younger tech companies. It seems like a lot of people are at their jobs for very long times so moving is not the easiest. The organization is very buercratic and it can be frustrating to see how longs some things take to get done.
Permanent employee,2.0,"Dec 17, 2014","Current employee, more than 5 years","telecommuting from work, flexibility (which means round-the-clock at times), friendly people all over, compensation is on-par if not better than its competitors, transparency","playing catch-up while pushing its weight on to competitors, employee morale low due to 'limited-restructuring', no one dares to challenge the status quo-some did and was sidelined, general prospects are gloomy, not a great place for young people, gen-y, millennials"
Software engineer ii,4.0,"Jan 2, 2015",Former employee,"Best thing about Cisco is the work culture, and the people. I joined this company as a fresher, and really enjoyed all the learning.

Additionally, if you are working on some of the relatively new products like UCS, it is a great opportunity for learning new technologies.","Cisco is  a huge company, and thus have all the cons associated with a mammoth company. The development cycles are long, and it takes time to fix thing because there is a development ideology being followed for a product, which might have become stale for the current requirements."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Feb 6, 2015",Current employee,Cisco is a great place to work for the most point.  There are creative over achievers who all want what's best.  Cisco is trying to start investing in it's employee and recognize they make Cisco what it is.  The investment in technology and the IOT promises to keep Cisco on the cutting edge of the ever changing market changes.,Some of the challenges are the salaries are not inline with other technology companies.  The advantages that Cisco used to have in benefits for employees are vastly disappearing which leaves it's employees to look only at salaries when comparing to other opportunities.
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Aug 12, 2016",Current employee,Fantastic culture built around continuous learning and growth. I couldn't have asked for a better internship experience. Leadership empowers you to take control of your professional success with constant feedback and visibility into the broad array of opportunities Cisco provides.,The only drawback about the internship process was the lack of information provided about the type of work we would be tasked with during the internship. Having material before the internship starts to get a better understanding of your role would be really helpful. The summer flys by and having the ability to maximize your time is essential.
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Sep 2, 2016",Current employee,Great pat and benefits.  Great work/ life balance and flex time.

Senior business operations management,3.0,"Sep 9, 2016",Current employee,"Great company, good benefits, great people, dynamic place","Don't plan on making Cisco a career employer, they target employees 5 + and the sad part is, they tell you ""it wasn't performance related"".   ""Workforce reductions"" are base on how much you make an tenure.  I've seen excellent people let go, only to bring in contractors and be rehired as a contractor."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Nov 2, 2016","Current employee, more than 10 years","Collaborative, matrix culture where teamwork and collaboration are valued and encouraged.

- Networking....it seems like anywhere you go after Cisco there are tons of ex-Cisco people which instantly bonds you
- Amazing benefits!","- Constant lay-offs make it hard to stay aligned with your goals and even know what you job is at times. Sometimes you also wonder how they make some of their decisions on who to keep and who to let go
- Because the company is so large, it can feel like the work you do is just a drop in the bucket
- Collaborative work spaces"
Software engineer,3.0,"Jun 26, 2018",Current employee,"- Work from home policy is very flexible
- Possibility to take leaves on a very short notice 
- Option available to buy more leaves

- Convenient location if driving from eastern part of county.
- Work/life balance is acceptable. There is almost never any pressure to stay beyond normal working hours.
- Great involvement in local community projects and charity organizations.
- People are genuinely very nice and fun to work with.
- Sports and Social club does a good job organising events throughout the year; there is however a membership fee to participate.
- On top of the above there is a separate fund to organize team outings every quarter which are always good fun.
- A lot of attention is given to constantly monitor and improve coffee machines.","- Strange location for an IT company, in the middle of an industrial park, outside of town. Not a very pleasant place to go for a walk with trucks and forklifts roaming around. Oranmore village is at least 20 min walk away, which is a bit far if one wants to go out for lunch. That's also where the bus stop is, so it's something to consider if using public transport to get to work.

 - Canteen is very bad. The catering staff are trying their best, but are very limited with what they can do because the kitchen is very badly fitted out, so they can’t prepare any half decent meals.

- Cisco is ultimately a sales, not an engineering company so while good engineering practises are appreciated by some, it’s not what necessarily gets people promoted.

- Salary, promotions and opportunities are good if one knows how to play the game and gets noticed by the right people.

- A somewhat weird/cringy ‘we are an amazing company’ attitude from some people. It’s disheartening how much self-affirmation we received from winning the somewhat irrelevant ‘Great Place to Work’ survey last year while conveniently forgetting that we were competing against some small insignificant companies. We are unlikely to stand a chance if the top US software companies (i.e. companies we should really be compared with) decided to participate in a survey like that. There was a time when they decided to start giving us a free bowl of fruit every day, which is a great initiative if it wasn't sold to us as the greatest thing ever i.e. on the same level of getting a free house.

- Because we don't really having any real proper competition in Galway, the company gets settled in the virtual security offered by ‘we are good enough for Galway’ mindset that hinders any effort or initiative to continuously improve and yet wonders why it is so difficult to attract experienced people in the field to work here."

If you are eager and ask for help you will receive help to develop yourself as a professional, not only on your current role but in general.

It is really focused on work/life balance and if you are struggling you get a lot of offers for help.","In my experience, the monthly salary is usually lower than what you can get in other companies, specially Cisco partners. However, the benefits package like stocks, bonuses, etc usually makes Cisco a better option."

Common thing to hear at Cisco, ""You should be happy you still have a job here""

Very Long Hours...not uncommon to work 70+ hour weeks."
Analyst,1.0,"Aug 20, 2008",Former employee,"The only good part is the name.  If you can get a job with the company and leverage its name towards moving up in your career, then that's about the best reason for working at Cisco.","Directors and middle managers are mostly incompetent and unable to lead or manage resources amongst them.  Instead, they like to take the success of their subordinates and make it there's.  So when it comes to proper recognition of work, acknowledgment of contribution, and everything you'd expect to advance in your career, you can forget about."
Project manager,2.0,"Oct 3, 2008",Former employee,resume building is good if you work there.  Once you leave it it will look really good to others who don't realize that it is just as backwards as lots of other companies,"the pay really sucks and they work you too hard.

Senior project manager,3.0,"Aug 4, 2010",Current employee,Strong company in growth industry.  Decent benefits and work atmosphere.,"Very corporate.  Middle management layer is not very good.

Decent PTO, average benefits","The Security and Government part of Cisco (can't call it a division because they don't like that word) is completely leaderless.

Systems administrator,4.0,"Dec 6, 2013","Current employee, more than 5 years","The company is better than most, does well by employees, focused on customer needs and market transitions.

Plenty of opportunities for learning and development and for finding new opportunities within the company.","It is a big company and it can be really hard at times to make sense of corporate strategy.  Internal communication is a challenge at which Cisco could be doing better.

My title was Software Engineer. Unfortunately it took a few months before I realized that although my title was SE, I was part of a QA group. It was odd that there was no differentiation of QA engineers and SE in the job title. Communication is slow and teams are all around the world.

Sales engineering leader,4.0,"Oct 9, 2011",Current employee,Cisco has historically been a great place to work. Management does care about the employees and their personal well being. The work is challenging and can be satisfying and rewarding. More recently with the troubles in Cisco's business the company is changing for the worse. There has been massive attrition of key engineers and engineering leaders and Cisco doesn't seem to be able to stop this trend. While the company is certainly not a disaster and the problems it faces are recoverable it needs to move quickly and decisively which is something it has not been able to do for the past 3+ years since it implemented the boards and councils management structure a mistake John Chambers is directly responsible for. Since then most of this structure has been removed and now its about getting the right leaders in place. Compensation is relatively fair especially if you have a good manager who recognizes who the contributors are. Benefits are really good to...,Attrition is a major issue right now and Cisco needs to stop the bleeding quickly and figure out not only how its going to retain the top talent but attract new talent which is especially difficult in Silicon Valley where there are many startups wooing the top talent as well as employees leaving to join the red hot social networking companies. You need talented engineers to build the best products and solutions in the market and while this won't effect the company in the next 12 - 18 months you will see the impact outside of that. The executive team is a group of extremely bright and talented business people but that is also the biggest problem is that there are no true Engineers at the top of the company and this is a technology company who needs great executive technology leadership!
Software engineer,4.0,"Mar 18, 2012",Current employee,"The are a very ethical and respectable company, with a very flexible work policy.

What I found(astoundingly) common them were that the people were so open and always ready to help (whatever it takes to get work done). It is always great to work at a place where work is not technically ""work"". 
Also internal movement is highly encouraged and very common. If you get tired of what you are doing or want to learn something new, there are plenty of new things to try out.

In summary, very talented people, great work-life balance and a lot of fun to work here!","As is commonly known, the remuneration is not great (when compared to companies of similar reputation)."

While you can put in lots of hours, stress levels are kept pretty low. We get the job done, but we don't' run over people to do it. Great benefits including the company medical facility in San Jose and employee Gym. Very smart people here and it's bay area. Traditionally a strong rotation culture but see cons list on this one. Generous bonuses. You also get a front-row seat on some pretty awesome technology and vision for the future.","Cisco does a terrible job identifying talent and promoting them, as a result of this and the recent layoffs and market challenges, I think Cisco is seeing a bit of a brain drain. I know and hear of plenty of notable talent heading for the doors. one reason they're leaving is this company prefers outside talent to fill open positions which clogs the top and greatly limits upward mobility. While traditionally a rotation company, which is great, open reqs have been almost all shut down coupled with the new focus of hiring in RTP North Carolina complicates and limits available rotations in San Jose. 
There's also very limited equity adjustments and a weak mechanism for distribution. After several years I learned new hires at my same level were being offered salaries higher than my own. That tells me Cisco values my time here less than brand new people and is the completely wrong message. Another gentle push out the door."

Software engineer,1.0,"Oct 12, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years",Great name recognition for your resume.  Decent benefits.,It's a popularity contest through and through.  An employee is graded on how well he/she kisses up to management and not performance or productivity.  A person can be the most productive and the most technical member of the group and still end up at the bottom 5% for frivolous reasons.  Managers only cares about trimming the workforce.

Thankfully, the horrible stack ranking system is finally on its way out.

Asic design engineer,4.0,"Dec 24, 2015","Former employee, more than 8 years","Generally speaking the work environment is very flexible, as long as you're producing quality work.  The compensation was reasonable, but it varies widely based on what group you're in and what projects you're working on.  The newer projects obviously get priority when it comes to budget, as well as the workload.","As said in another review of Cisco that I read, it is very easy to slowly get sucked-in and end up working 14 hour days.  Generally speaking, you will be rewarded based on what you put into it.  So if you choose to put up boundaries and stick to a 40-hour week, you'll be comfy and cozy.  If you choose to put in 60-80 hour weeks, you're likely to be elevated in the long term (provided you're not in a group that's approaching ""sustaining-mode"" where there is very little new development).
If you're lucky enough to get into the ""in-crowd"" and you're a hard worker that puts out quality product, you're set for life.  Cisco has a very elite group of people that jump ship every few years, create a new start-up (i.e. ensime, nuovo, andiamo), work their tails' off, get purchased by Cisco making tons of money, and repeat.  But getting into that group is extremely difficult even if you're good at what you do.  There's a bit of class-ism in the Cisco HW department."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 5, 2016",Former employee,"Negative overall experience. But will give credit where it's due. Pay is somewhat competitive and benefits are good if you're new to tech or bay area. But not comparable to ""established"" younger and newer tech companies. However, best benefit is WFH or working remotely. You might have to work out details with your team or they might not care - but you can pretty much work where-ever you want, which is a pretty sweet perk to have and makes traveling much more flexible (and affordable).","With that said, there were WAY MORE cons than pros. It's an older company and people are stuck in the past. They're trying to change and adopt younger viewpoints, but if you're young, good luck. Yes, you'll hear people put down younger peers b/c they're more ""junior"" or ""less knowledgable"" - and apparently that's okay (why?). Culture's cut-throat, very political and everyone's trying to one-up everyone else. Saving face is more important than being honest - which ironically is the only way to improve and actually impact the bottom line. This is not the place to be if you seek, speak and spit out the truth. You WILL be seen as ""difficult"" and your career WILL be negatively impacted. Also business moves at glacial pace and everyone spends more time talking about what they will do than actually doing it. Also zero accountability - if you're managing a project and need to see it through, you WILL be working with people who don't care and you WILL have to pick up their slack. Again, if you're young, career advancement is limited - unless you're with a good manager who ""gets it"". More rare than common. WFH is also great at first but gets real old, fast. You'll miss the in person time and communicating with remote co-workers will require 2x the work. Best advice? Get in, get the experience you need and then move on. Don't get stuck in the cycle."
Sales manager,4.0,"Dec 8, 2016","Former employee, more than 1 year",A great company to work for. The benefits are fantastic and the people are top notch.,Beware every year there is an expectation of transition. Transition to Cisco means that there will be an organization that gets changed and reorganized resulting in Layoffs. This means that as soon as you get hired network and look for your follow on job immediately. Cisco's definition of diversity currently focuses on white women. On the surface Cisco is very friendly to minorities but hiring retention trends on the manager through the VP ranks until you get to the CEO board suggests otherwise.

- Culture of driving success: it's expected that you challenge the status quo, not just do things the way they've always been done
- Endless learning potential with a company this large and complex","Not exactly a con, but the downside to the extreme flexibility in work schedule is the fact that you have to own your schedule and defend your work life balance. There's always support for the work life balance, but it doesn't always present itself."
Tac engineer,2.0,"Mar 29, 2019","Former employee, more than 5 years","- Best place to learn networking technologies at a level that you won’t get anywhere else
- Depending on which team/technology you support, the skills you obtained from here can take you to the next level level position at a lucrative salary elsewhere (yes, people from TAC have moved to companies like Amazon & Google, if that’s what interests you)
- Colleagues are friendly, nice and supportive
- Free exams when attempting for any Cisco certs, including CCIE
- Many opportunities to move to a different team/technology within the TAC theatre but not so much outside TAC","- The salary in TAC is below par. Many times I have raised this issue to my direct managers & even to the higher bosses during skip-level meetings about considering to increase the overall pay across all grades but not a single cent has ever increased! Oh, and those eNPS survey as well. Not sure if the bosses who read the surveys ever showed some sympathy to the suffering TAC engineers
- The kind of work you do in TAC is very narrow. You can be highly skilled in X technology but your knowledge in other technologies can be very poor (unless you have gained experience in these “other technologies” from your previous roles)
- Favouritism! TAC has a funny system to get a payrise or a grade promotion because managers value you merely based upon what you have showed off to them or what they saw from the metrics/stats and not so much with the depth of the technical knowledge & experience you have gained over the years + the challenging issues you have resolved on your own + the number of times you have helped your colleagues with difficult cases. These are stuff the managers have failed to notice! Whoever read this may disagree but they disagreed because they never understood and they always thought they were right. This place can be awesome for newbies/grads because if they showed off their little contributions here and there, worked hard, stayed in the office after hours to either study or work on cases, and be nice to the managers, they will surely get the cool stuff, travel to other Cisco’s offices for BU rotations etc, and get promoted to the higher grade very quick even surpassing the salary of the seasoned TAC engineers
- Politics everywhere! I have always wanted to stay in Cisco (outside TAC, of course) and I have applied for many other internal jobs before moving on. Of all those many internal positions I have applied, 95% of the time, I got NO interview invitations at all. Did my resume failed to impress the recruiter? Was there some kind of favouritism in other departments as well? Didn’t they like TAC engineers at all? Was there some kind of politics being played out? I don’t know the true answers but whatever the reasons are, it’s funny how I got an offer upon my very first external job application from one of the Big Four tech companies. Funny but this is the reality!
- Constant & very high number of employee attritions due to the above reasons
- High pressure work environment because you are basically a support engineer which means that you are there to resolve problems after problems, and for every customer, their problem is always urgent to be resolved. And because TAC always lack of engineers (due to constant resignations), it creates a constant burnout mentally & physically"

If you are not at least a Dir level you have no ""status"" and no one pays attention to you, calls you back, or responds to your email.  Severe lack of promotions or career advancement.

I am disappointed at the significant number of people who have advanced upwards who are ""good at playing the game"" but are not ""good people"".  Way too San Jose centric - remote employees are an after thought at best.  Extreme cliques and a culture of ""who you know"" to get things done or get ahead.

Systems engineer iii,3.0,"Apr 28, 2009",Former employee,"Cisco is highly regarded within the industry and by customers so there is a certain amount of professional prestige that goes with the company.

There is a lot of opportunity for professional development, although the amount of actual TIME you are given to pursue it varies by manager. If you have a good manager and a decent territory, then the job can be satisfying, rewarding and fun. Self-starters will enjoy themselves and in some ways working for Cisco feels a lot like being self-employed (especially if you work in a remote location.)

Technical resources for engineers varies widely depending on office location and manager's personal style. If you are in San Jose, Herndon or RTP, then you will have easy access to lab equipment and gear. If you are remote, well, not so much... 

For the larger sites, Cisco offers a well-laid path for supplies, access and availabilty, although getting ahold of the latest and greatest products seems to be very sporadic. (It can be tough to sell the latest product effectively if you have never seen one in person!)","Personal experience and job satisfaction will vary widely depending on your location and on your manager. I've worked both at a large office and as a remote employee, and large office is definitely a far better experience. 

Even though Cisco has thousands of remote employees, they are frequently treated as an after-thought.  Mid-level managers do not seem to be trained in dealing with remote employees and many times they act as though ""out of sight, out of mind"". As a remote worker, my manager should be my main tie to corporate, but I usually got better, faster, more accurate and more complete info from friends who worked in different parts of the company.  

Some managers will authorize time out of the office for training, some will not. Your ability to pursue professional development will depend completely on your current manager. Many managers feel that with the number of virtual courses available, then you should never have to take off for training. There is some merit to this postion, but you can't focus on a virtual course if you are not given the time away from your regular job to ""attend"" it. 

Every August at the beginning of the fiscal year, Cisco re-organizes. Teams change, the managers change, the focus changes, etc. July is usually a useless month because everyone is holding their collective breath waiting to see how the re-org goes and in August there is always a giant account shuffle. It is completely wasteful. During one five year period I was re-organized four times. At the end of that time, I ended up more or less where I started but my team had a slightly different name. 

The worst part about the annual shuffle is that incoming managers always want to tinker with the structure/focus of their team. As Systems Engineers, we had a technological specialty area that we were supposed to become experts on. Every year, the teams' new manager would change the area assignments. This forced us to set aside our other projects and re-qualify for our new team assignments. There were usually several tests involved and a couple of weeks worth of studying in order to pass them. The upheaval always seemed totally arbitrary and not at all productive.

Cisco does not offer a very good work/life balance. (I doubt that they have ever even heard of the term.) The only time they encourage you to take vacation is when they need to get the hours off of the books for accounting purposes.  I have had managers tell me that they want me to take vacation time, but still work on whatever project I was working on.  Also, I have seen a couple of cases where an employee was hassled by their manager for taking time off to deal with a death in the family (once for the employee's child, once for a parent.)

Nights and weekends are fair game for emails and phone calls. I have had a manager call me at 11 PM, just to ""catch up on things"". As a remote worker in a different time zone, I have done several conference calls between the hours of 2 AM and 4 AM . (These were not for emergency purposes, these were just for the convenience of the manager.) 

Cisco is definitely a male-oriented company and women face a unique set of challenges. There are almost NO women in management within certain divisions. I was the only woman on my team for years, and it can be a somewhat hostile work-environment. I skipped any ""team-building"" that took place at Hooters or at strip clubs in Vegas. On one team building event during the sales meeting in Vegas, I asked to be dropped off at my hotel rather than tag along to a Gentlemen's Club . (My manager openly ridiculed me for that in front of the rest of the team.) Going to HR is widely considered to be the kiss of death to your career, so very few complaints are lodged.  I believe this sort of behavior is not tolerated in every part of Cisco because I know women who have transferred out of the division that I worked in and they said it was a different world on the outside."
Technical lead,3.0,"Jun 6, 2009",Current employee,"You can balance personal life very well with job. Again, it depends on the which group you are working with. You can just plan to work for eight hours a day, rest is yours. Benefits are good compared to other same level of organizations.","Management is old-school. It is hard to convince the management some times, as they can not see the value in the innovations. For the same reason, management fail to asses/promote good resources"
Engineer,3.0,"Dec 8, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco is great for your resume and giving you good experience at how global organizations work. It gives you exposure to a broad customer base, and how each of those work as well. There is a lot to be learned that's both technical and experiential. 

The benefits are (were) great, but now they're dwindling with every cycle. 

There are still a few managers who DO care, but you may have to dig to find one during your career. 

Salary is (was) great, but buying power is dwindling with the lack of merit/COLA increases. 

If you're customer-facing there is still a good deal of job security. If you're in IT or development, not-so-much, offshoring is the name of the game. 

For a really big company, it really is one of the better one's out there. 

Some of the serious technology plays have a good chance at being highly successful and keeping Cisco on top of the industry pack.","Leadership team members have lost touch with reality, and are primarily drinking the Kool-Aid. They communicate the direction to Sr Management and line-management, and those managers are then forced to try and take an untenable vision/strategy and execute upon it. How well they can balance reality with fantasy determines how well you, as an individual contributor will do. 

In the ancient past, if you chose to bring up a serious weakness of a product/service you were considered to be contributing to the success of the team, now if you are outspoken you are not a team player. Empowerment is now non-exsistent. Mediocrity is becoming the norm, and those that want to excel are starting to look outside the doors of Cisco now that the Golden Handcuffs (stocks/bonus/benefits) are evaporating. 

The EPM (employee review) cycle is a joke and your reviews are strictly based on your manager and his/her ability to 'fight' for you at leadership ratings/ranking meetings. 
Have a passive manager who doesn't like a good fight or has someone else they're solely rooting for? You'll not get that strong E+ or X rating to get that promotion or salary increase. Period. 
If you have a passionate manager that cares for his/her people, then they can eventually ""spread some love around"" to you, but chances are it will take a few cycles. 

A note to prospective employees: Once your inside, if you plan on sticking around, shop for those managers... If you can find one that's good with people, technically sharp, and somewhat politically savvy at the same time you might be able to also get some promotions along the way as he/she rides the wave upward. You need to use your skills/merit to leverage yourself into an org that will allow you to play this game, then you can be promoted. This skill took me a long time to learn, but it's a good one to learn, since it doesn't just apply here as Cisco is just like any other big company now. 

And yes: negotiate a high starting salary - you may not see an increase for some time."

Didn't feel like the company is fit for freshers, but good and manageable if you really want to purse in networking domain. This review is a bit biased since I have only seen Networking devices business of the company and not other businesses like Collaboration, Security, Cloud etc

- Company culture is good. Not toxic or work obsessed.
- Some good work in selected teams and projects (May be 5% of total teams).
- Very employee friendly in terms for PTOs, WFHs, Maternity/Paternity leaves etc.
- Good work life balance.
- Less workload in most teams (depends on project or releases)
- Code reviews usually make you a good progammer but it depends on the attitude of the reviewers.
- Managers are mostly good and friendly.
- Healthy food in cafeterias
- Very good office environment and infrastructure.
- You will have enough time to purse your hobbies or interests outside/inside work.
- Good gyms and games facilities.

Heard good things about other businesses under Cisco but don't have first hand knowledge of it. New projects, young technologies etc might be good.","In general, not good for people who want to grow in their career. All the points are from the eyes of a fresher.

- Work is mostly sustenance of legacy code and occasional feature addition.
- Less learning opportunities.
- Process oriented. Very difficult to get things done. Coding is only 10% of actual process to get the code or bug in.
- Most of the good work is usually done in US and is moved to India for sustenance or continuation after success.
- Pay is not competitive. They try to give the minimum possible to make employee stay.
- US or abroad folks see India as cheap labor market and have this attitude is few occasions.
- Many senior folks stay because they can't go elsewhere to get this good treatment at this stage of their career.
- Many has become used to this slow environment and don't want to change anything other than getting more money.
- Managers are bit obsessed about metrics like bug count, bug incoming, customer bug count etc but not about the product as a whole since it has grown so large for its own good.
- Difficult for a fresher to get up to speed and start contributing since there are no proper documentations for old code.
- Mentoring may not always be a feasible/effective idea since there is lot of history/legacy reasons associated with everything.
- Hike cycle has been every bad in my experience. They postpone 6 months to 1 yr to give hikes and state lame reasons. When they do give, its not up to expectations or market rates.
- They hardly give any stocks to non senior folks as rewards.
- Promotions are given for good performers but management considers experience as the biggest factor for grade change. Hence, it is nearly impossible to get promoted in 1 or 2 yr even if you perform exceptionally. 
- Company is so big, you wont get any visibility more than 2 levels in most caseses. (i am 7 or 8 levels down)
- Less breadth of work to really show your talents. You will get used to the slow moving environment and loose the enthusiasm especially when you are a fresher."

Hardware/software intern,4.0,"Jul 16, 2008",Current employee,"Great salary when compared against other companies' internship programs.

If you're working at the San Jose campus, you'll find many other college students scattered across the campus, as Cisco hires students from a variety of universities across the country. As other reviews have mentioned, the new hire program offers opportunities to meet with your peers.

You will be working on pertinent projects with full-time employees, doing the same [if not similar] things they're doing. If your team is busy, you'll be busy too.

There's an ""open-door"" culture at work - if you have questions or concerns, you are free to bring it up to your manager or co-workers. Many of them are more than willing to help you learn and contribute while you're here.","If you're not a local, relocating to San Jose can be confusing. Although Cisco offers relocation compensation, it'll be up to you to find a place to live for the next 3 to 6 months. ""Corporate housing"" is not offered for interns and co-ops. However, the Silicon Valley area has seen so many interns/temps that many neighborhoods/apartments offer short-term or month-to-month leases.

This might not seem like a ""con"" (especially if you're a college student), but if your team needs you to stay until midnight to get something done, expect to do so (and expect overtime pay as well).

Despite my short stay, I have definitely caught a whiff of the stagnating bureaucracy that can drive you, your project, and your co-workers nuts. But I suppose this is what happens in a ""big company."""

There is more focus on increasing your ""visibility"" and building your ""personal brand"" aka behind-kissing than the value of your actual work.  I've seen people work their tails off year after year and still receive a mediocre rating (I've been an Individual Contributor AND a manager, so I've seen this from both angles).  Managers don't have the final say in an individual's performance rating anymore.  That is left up to the leadership team within their organization (they do submit a recommendation).  The final decision is made whether or not they've ""heard"" of this individual's work.  Seriously.  This absolutely equates to a culture of fear, distrust and non-collaboration.  I've seen this personally multiple times.  People are working for their rating vs. working for Cisco.  It's an incredible way to make your employees non-productive.  

It just feels like a sinking ship.  After nearly 10 years, I have very little confidence in the Operating Committee or senior leadership within my own organization to turn things around.  The cycle here is Q1=re-org/layoff   Q2= finally figure out what your new role/team should be doing  Q3=your team actually starts performing  Q4=great performance, but word of a new re-org rolls in, layoff rumors start, productivity goes down the toilet.

Other people say Cisco has good work life balance. I think it depends on what product you are working on. I feel like I am under a lot of stress generally and put in a lot of hours. I have been at Cisco over 10 years and there haven't been a lot of breaks. 

Many of my coworkers work from home at least a couple days a week, especially after they moved us to an open floor plan.

The people I work with are for the most part friendly, smart and professional.

I love making killer products that make billions of dollars of revenue each year.

I learn new things constantly and feel challenged.","At least in engineering, there is not a supportive environment for women. There is lack of education among the first line managers how to promote respect and give air time to all type of people, and to promote, give opportunities, listen to and value the ideas of  women. And there is some blatant sexism. For example, when I had my baby, my manager told me the 'right' thing to do was to become a stay at home mom. And despite  making a sacrificial effort to perform well my first year with a baby, my manager said he gave me an average rating because I had a baby. His perception was colored by my being  a mother. I thought I deserved a higher rating for an exceptional year. And he asked me what are my priorities, my child or my job? He didn't ask my male coworkers this question. Even now, he 'forgets' to give me a bonus even though he gave every other report of his one (who are all male). In the previous two layoffs, the only persons he laid off were women. He asks me to plan the fun group outings, not my male colleagues. On separate occasions, my director and my VP asked me to take minutes when there were plenty of men available to also take minutes. Many of my female coworkers moved on because of the frustration of not having their opinions valued as much as our male coworkers. It's a tough problem to solve because people come to Cisco from many types of backgrounds, but I feel there is no management support from any level of the management chain except for Chuck and his direct reports. 

Open space floorplan is distracting visually and audially. The space is so tight that the moveable whiteboards are not near our desks.

Currently, morale is a little down because it is not clear how individuals will be engaged in making the future roadmap happen. People fear for their jobs. We've had repeated layoffs in my group, and there will be more to come."

* Upper management throws around tons of buzzwords but seems to be completely disconnected from the struggles of the troops on the ground. This may be true of all large companies, though.
* Cisco is ""open"", but unless you've been there 10-15 years and have no fear of losing your job, most people will not raise the questions/concerns they have in open/public forums.

* There are lots of employee-lead organizations, but unless you're in a non-technical role (sales, marketing, HR, finance), you really don't have time to join them, especially when you are expected to work after-hours and weekends.

Great job to have on your resume

Front row seat to the latest and greatest technology trends in the industry","Line managers more concerned about their own success rather than their direct reports success

Diversity policy is pure comedy gold -- most diversity hires are very limited in ability and are not strategic hires or promotions.

Promotions are purely political -- not based on ability/accomplishments

Director level (and below) management is ill-equipped to lead, but is great at parroting corporate buzzwords

Company  fits the definition of  ""bloated bureaucracy"" quite well

Stock options went away, and now only executive levels benefit from (excessive) stock grants

Constant reference to ""Cisco family"" is ironic, unless your  ""family""  fosters an atmosphere of back-stabbing, brown-nosing employees

Fanatical expense reduction has sucked the life out of the workforce and has brought morale to an all-time low

Focus on political correctness has resulted in an atmosphere of  ""yes men""

Committees and councils do not equal ""nimble""

EPM process (annual reviews)  is laughable, and fits right in to the culture of cronyism

Entirely too many VPs (446 as of July '09), and quite a few of them are simply cashing a paycheck

Empire building prevalent even amongst lowly line managers

360 review process is a joke, as HR is not willing to listen to criticism of managers

Career growth is non-existent.  There is no benefit to moving within the company because you can't get a promotion or raise even if you get hired for a position that is a higher grade level.

Your direct manager has no say in your evaluation rating, it is all rolled up to executive levels who arbitrarily rank order you.

Cisco loves to talk about hiring the top 5% of talent, then they want to compensate them at the 70th percentile (if that), and not recognize their efforts.  This causes low morale and limits the effort that people are willing to put into their work.  If everyone in the company is top 5% of talent, why do the rankings have to fit an arbitrary bell-curve distribution.  Isn't it possible that you have a high performing organization because they are all top talent?

Cisco wants their employees to work like it is a start-up, i.e. lots of hours, however, there are no start-up type benefits.  Individual contributors don't get stock (but execs get lots), there is no career advancement (see point 2).  Why should I bust my ass for no reward.  Cisco wants you to be ""happy you still have a job"" in the current environment and they manage by fear.  Apple employees are asked to work like it is a start-up, but they still get broad based stock grants.

Cisco talked a good game about open communication and transparency, but when an exec was asked in an all-hands how many VPs and Directors were impacted by the ""limited restructuring"" (i.e. lay-off) of 3-5% of the company, the response was ""we're not going to talk about that""

Good benefits - Free health insurance.

Get to work with modern technologies, environments and programming languages.

get to spend a good bit of time actually coding new features vs
just bug fixing etc. 

Good hardware for work.

Very good to the wider community and are continuously raising money for good causes.","No career progression. Very possible to get stuck in same
position / salary for years on end in this company.
Seem to have no budget for career advancement at the moment.

Very difficult to stay motivated.

Good engineering practices are not always recognized.
Management say they care about quality but only seem to reward
engineers who produce at speed but cause many bugs in our products.
Actions speak louder than words.

No team structure. You don't know what you will be working on week to week. Very varied. Can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the person.
Not what I like in a work place environment.

Very frugal in general with employees i.e Don't help pay for Christmas Party.
We used to have release parties but since we are releasing on a continuous basis
this has all dried up. Again no recognition to the dedication of employees.

Since we develop communications applications there is a culture of always being online
and it can be common to seeing people replying to messages at 11 - 12pm at night. Can be
very difficult to switch off. Management don't directly encourage this but also
don't try to curb this behavior.

Canteen is expensive for what you get. Cisco didn't provide the catering
contractor and canteen staff with the proper facilities so they have to make do with pre made factory food and microwaves. Food seems highly processed and as such the quality isn't very good.

Vending machines have no healthy options.

Senior Management are more obsessed with image i.e Winning Great Place 
To Work instead of actually improving the work environment for employees.

I feel that management don't listen to employees concerns. 
I had many experiences of engineers on the team voicing common sense concerns about the direction of the product to management only to fall on deaf ears. 
Eventually the customer voiced the same concerns and so we ended up wasting countless engineering hours backtracking on previous work. This has happened on many
occasions.

Over the last number of years there has been annual redundancies with out fail. 
It has actually affected the Galway site a couple of times. One year a whole team was let go. 
This was without consideration to the performance of individual members of the team. So it
doesn't matter how good you are you could still be let go at anytime."

Anonymous employee,5.0,"Apr 1, 2020","Former employee, more than 8 years","One of the best parts of Cisco's culture is the focus on driving results.

The result is chains of incompetent management. Marketing is ridiculously superficial and self-serving. Development is cheap and poor quality.

Indeed Chambers is a great CEO. He's an excellent business manager, visionary and leader.

Network engineer,4.0,"Apr 25, 2009",Current employee,"I joined Cisco right after graduating with my Master of Science degree. It is obviously one of the biggest high-tech companies and it is very stable. We have all the right infra structure so we are fully empowered to do our jobs. Also, most functions are located in the Bay Area campus so we have less issues dealing with multi site issues, although we do have occasional issues like that.",It is a huge company and sometimes there is a danger of becoming an anonymous worker amongst endless of other smart colleagues. Also managers tend to have too much power.
Business development manager,4.0,"May 18, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco is a great company to build someone's career at.  Gaining 5+ years at Cisco is not only a resume builder for a young person starting his/or her's career, but also having the knowledge in the latest technologies (DC virtualization, CORE/EDGE Routing, UC, Telepresence, etc).  I've gained wonderful experiences at Cisco  and very proud to work for a company with a great name recognition and being a part of some of the most innovative ideas with some of the brightest folks.  This is a great place to start a career if you only have 5 to maybe 8 years work experience.  Also, you benefit from its strong benefits but it might be changing due to the down economy.  The company paid for my MBA school ($60k) and supported me through any career developments I wanted to tackle.  

Furthermore, I loved working at Cisco because they are world-class in how they treat their employees during a restructuring.  Cisco typically lay-off policy is that you get 60 days to find a job within the company.  If you cannot find a job within after the 60 days, then the company gives a 4 months severance + COBRA paid for during those 4 months.  Hence, it is like a 6 months severance period.  Also, Cisco pays 4 months of services for an executive search firm (Lee Hecht Harrison) to help you polish up on your interview skills, and resume building, and how to network.  That is not bad compared to other companies.","Though, I think Cisco is a great company, there are some downsides.  I think the number #1 downside for me that has been frustrating is expanding my career within the company.  I started at Cisco within IT and after my MBA school, I wanted to explore to the Sales Organization and try to work with the account teams.  Though I made that transition, it was very very difficult to crack into it.  I did it through tireless networking and a ton of referrals.  I will always be grateful for my manager in the sales org. to give me a shot.  But truthfully, Cisco is a typical large company that does not allow folks to move from one discipline to another.  The company would rather have you quit, gain the experience outside, then come back to the company serving the job function you would want.  Or during the most recent restructuring (6k people were impacted), the company would rather lay you off, then rehire folks who have that skill/talent.  I hate mentioning that because that is classic business-school 101.  However, I know that HR is trying to rectify that problem.  However, I doubt it will work due to the culture of the company.

Another downside is getting promotions.  Though as I mention that it is a great place to start anyone's career (which is very true), the company does not do a great job of giving you promotions to keep you.  I've been at Cisco for 5+ years and never had a promotion.  Though, I've had several raises, never received a promotion (keep in mind I went from IT to sales which is maybe the reason I did not get a promotion.  Starting in a new org. brings you back to square one on the promotion track).  It is very difficult and political to receive promotions at Cisco.  So something to think about, if you are interviewing for a position within Cisco, try to get the highest possible grade level you can, If you are a mid-level manager.  If you are someone straight out of school, then you are at the mercy of the company compensating you cheap compared to its competitors."
Program manager,2.0,"Jun 26, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco is great for job security and takes great measures to retain FTEs.  The ability to get your work done with flexible hours and/or the ability to work from home is also a GREAT perk.  And because of the size of the company, there are a lot of options to move internally (lateral) to see different sides of the business.","There is an excessive amount of middle management layers, which can often result in poor top-to-bottom communication and poor bottom-to-top visibility.  Cisco is also not very good at career advancement, specifically if you are an ambitious go-getter, as promotions and raises tend to have more to do with seniority and less to do with performance.  They also have an internal policy that you can not get promoted when you switch positions.  While I believe the intent was so that people do not jump from job to job simply for a pay increase, what happens in practice is top performers who move to a new opportunity for a new challenge, have to make that move laterally even when it is a job with more responsibility.  However, if you stay in the same role for years, you will eventually get promoted just because of seniority.  As a result, many top performers make a few lateral moves and then leave the company in order to get a promotion."

Not all contractors can become regular employees of Cisco. So be aware with all the terms and conditions.
Politics -> but which company doesn't have it in India. So, it's okay in my understanding.
Less growth. If you want to become a manager in Cisco, being a Cisco-ite not possible. Join some other company become a manager and then join Cisco as manager if possible. Climbing the hierarchy is not simple in Cisco."

Decisions from leadership can  sometimes seem draconian. I've seen entire teams dismissed at the drop of a hat. Presumably these events come as the result of a compelling business reason, but that's not ever communicated clearly throughout the ranks, contributing to an overall sense of vulnerability among staff.

There are many BUs within the company that are siloed off from one another, making it difficult to streamline and share institutional knowledge. This can lead to inefficiencies and duplicated efforts. 

I can't honestly say that the executives' vision for the company is clearly communicated. It can be challenging to find after several months (or years) of working toward a target, that the target was moved by someone in the board room and your team wasn't informed.

Sometimes a focus on selling or adding new features takes precedence over improving existing functionality, which in turn means accrual of tech debt.

Constant lack of resourcing means that we often find ourselves struggling to keep up. The commitment asks for new integrations, new features, often exceed our capacity.

Talent is often times overlooked if you aren't a vocal person.
Associate account manager,5.0,"May 18, 2008",Current employee,"First of all, I am PROUD to work for Cisco Systems, as it is the leader in the high tech industry. Secondly, though all Cisco employees work very hard, we are all well compensated for our hard work. Cisco employees (from admins to sales) make an average of $130k per year. I am in sales, so if you are looking to run a business with the backing of a huge corporation, Cisco Systems is the place to be. The comany and management truly empowers their employees to reach success and grow with the company. At 24 years old, I make six figures and after less than 2 years in the field, I am already up for promotion. Stock options are great, beneftits are great, and the ""work hard, play hard"" mentality at Cisco makes it tremendously fun to work for this company!!","Though you pretty much set your own hours (nobody really breathing down your neck) the hours can tend to be long, if you are driven to succeed. Given everything is technology oriented, you can find yourself on your computer working long days into the late night and on weekends. You are required (and rightly compensated) to work whatever hours it takes to get the job done. If you can complete a task and be done by 4pm everyday...great. If you need to work until 10pm to get everything done that day, then that is what you must do. You are encouraged to take time off  away from Cisco, but that can sometimes be hard for people that are as driven as I am to succeed and exceed expectations."
Software engineer,3.0,"Jun 17, 2008",Current employee,"The best thing about working for Cisco might just be that you if you are a competent and productive engineer, you have quite a bit of flexibility in defining your role and your contribution level. If you are really gunning for promotions, look for a good group, find a niche, take on roles that are difficult or un-wanted, and work your rear end off. If you want to coast and balance your time between work and other interests, then find a steady group, manage your time well, and you can stay safe in your job with just about 40 hours of work a week... and you might have the flexibility to telecommute or work from home.","There is one other danger I must mention. This applies even in 'good' groups. There is a tendency at Cisco to just keep loading you with more and more responsibilities until you actually stand up and say enough. If this is an interesting job, you might find that you are spending more time on work than you had originally planned, at the expense of family, friends, etc. So decide for yourself how much you want to work and what your goals are. And then be prepared to work with your management to define the appropriate role.
No one will come and ask you what you want at Cisco. You have to decide that for yourself, and then communicate it to your management.
Also, if you do end up in a bad situation, be prepared to make an honest assessment of the situation and leave. No one likes to quit, but if you end up staying 5 or 6 years without fair rewards, you will find yourself falling well behind people who were your peers when you started... and this is really not a good experience.”"

The intelligence of conversations were by far in large very intriguing. The people I worked with while in training will not only be colleagues but friends for ever. This is extremely important in helping shape your career, as in the future these will most certainly prove to be invaluable resources.

On top of this Cisco is committed to providing you endless amounts of resources to help further your career. You will be rewarded for your achievements and I am talking about the kind of reward that maters to most of the world...

The CSAP provides opportunities down several paths not just one which was important to me. Opportunities exist for you to work with in the industry that you desire. 

This was without a doubt one of the most rewarding times in my life, It is something I will look back on and feel proud to be a part of.","Well, we sure do work hard, which means working a lot. Be prepared to put in your fair share in. This may seem like a negative to some but you won't always have a manager that is telling you what to do. You have to further your learning by your self and find ways to create value. I take this as a blessing as I do not fit well into molds.

It's hard, as an outsider to these groups, to get information out of them. Management needs to force their hands. Cooperation is not what it should be, even among people in the same department.

I've always worked for managers many states away, communicating regularly but not too often, by Cisco's HD video technology. I've never been micromanaged and always been empowered to work when, where and how I choose as long as I am performing and excelling at my deliverables. This has allowed me to very successfully transition in to my new life as a working mom where unlike most of my friends I haven't had to make the choice between career and present parenting. I can truly do both, even as a breastfeeding mother and didn't have to take a single step back. Maternity leave was ridiculously generous and long enough that I actually felt excited to come back to work (especially since I work from home near my baby and nanny). The other perks for new moms that Cisco provides are over the top generous between milk stork, $100 lactation store credit, stuffed animals and baby books mailed to my home, free lactation consultant, and more. So thankful for Cisco and the wonderful career, no, wonderful LIFE, working here has afforded me. No reason I wouldn't spend my whole career here as I believe these benefits are unique to Cisco in the tech world. Speaking of the actual work I've always been empowered and encouraged to pursue new and interesting opportunities across many departments and job titles. I've always been promoted and given raises before I even thought to ask for them. Cisco has treated me really well.",Being a huge company there is some waste and duplication of efforts which can be frustrating at times.
Customer success specialist,5.0,"Sep 9, 2020","Current employee, more than 3 years","A Customer Success Specialist (CSS) is a technical person, who is given the task of acting as a technical consultant for customers, in the post-sales stage. The goal is helping customer with product adoption.

The daily job is a mix of studying/practicing with the technology, on one side, and engaging with customers in meetings and workshop, on the other: so, it's a very interesting mix between technical and ""soft"" skills. 
It's particularly indicated for technical people who have a passion for explaining, helping, engaging with people. It's the ideal position for people with a strong technical background, who wish to move a little bit towards the business and the communications side of the IT work.

The Customer Success organization in Cisco is still very young, which gives an opportunity to stay in an enthusiastic environment and to shape the organization, because many processes still need to be finalized.
At the same time, it's a growing part of the company, because Cisco's vision is to focus more and more on recurrent revenues, and therefore on subscription renewal, and therefore on adoption.

Being a post-sales role, there is not excessive pressure, because CSSs are not measured in relation to a sales quota. This gives time to learn, and to establish a good life/work balance.","The cons are exactly the other side of the coin, if compared to the pros.

E.g.: Since Customer Success is a young organization, things are changing very often: the management is changing ideas and adjusting the strategy very frequently. This is not ideal for people who like to stay on a solid ground, or to be constantly told what to do.

Another example: since the role is post-sales and not bound to sales quotas, as a result the compensation and the incentives won't be so high as in a sales role. But, in turn, you get lower pressure and stress."
Software engineer,4.0,"Apr 1, 2021","Current employee, more than 3 years","People are approachable and ready to help.

Stock hasn’t moved much in years.
They pay is fair, but people have gone years without a raise of 2-3% even when the company performs well.
Few management opportunities and almost no management training."
Senior software engineer,5.0,"Jan 14, 2022","Former employee, more than 8 years","Big Company with a lot of interesting development work to be done.

Learned a ton, met many incredibly smart people, and overall had a great time.",Like any big company the processes can be a bit heavy at times and things don't always move as fast as you'd like.

no feedback on work other than ""nothing to say"" or ""you shouldn't be here"" (then later, ""nothing to say"")

culture is completely dead, soulless.

basically a technological backwater at this point, ridiculous decisions made at every level. 

priorities not really aligned with making good products, company is doomed in some areas.

all the other reviews are absolutely true, the company is filled with bad management. I didn't believe it, but sure enough 

I honestly don't understand why people stay here for years, I cant imagine doing so."
Technical leader,4.0,"Oct 27, 2022","Current employee, more than 5 years",Good work-life balance and online training subscriptions.,Pay is average and almost no pay hikes once you joined unless you're promoted. Leadership team biased to liberal politics and act like they are running for office with too many social  initiatives.

Nice co-workers. Cisco respects employees well. Diversity is celebrated well. Senior leadership is strong.","Too large. You are in one in thousands.  Not much innovation inside the company.
Takes a long time to make any impact.  Lot of layers of management.  Typical
disadvantages of working for a very large enterprise company. Not the best place

Software contractor,5.0,"Feb 11, 2009",Former employee,"Very stable employer.  I contracted here during the financial crisis, and I was allowed to stay for the entire duration of my 6 month contract.

Software engineer iv,2.0,"Aug 18, 2010",Current employee,"* Flexible work hours
* Management not averse to employees working from home
* Company gym is convenient
* Used to be able to attend classes, but that seems to be changing with budget cuts.
* 401K match is decent. 100% match upto 4% contribution.","* Unbearable levels of politics.
* Unhealthy Performance Review process. Because they need to document why they are unable to promote you, management purposefully kills your self esteem. The process is very unhealthy. The purpose of the epm is no longer a tool for healthy development, but rather a tool for managers to 'keep score', put you down, and keep you 'under control' - these are actual words I have heard. It happens 3 times a year, and for this alone, avoid this place.
* Its a big company, but management is constantly ratcheted under pressure. What happens is people run very fast, work under a lot of pressure, but with the added huge overhead of a big company. And they run round and round, instead of making progress. People who say things are slow are not working in engineering groups where the pressure is immense and very unrewarding.
* Benefits are cut almost constantly. 
** The paycheck contributions for Health has been going up ever since I joined 4 years ago.
** We used to get free water bottles - that's gone. 
** We are expected to attend meetings late at night, early mornings, and work weekends but Cisco will not pay for broadband (that went a couple of years ago).  How can they expect you to work weekends? Oh, they will not say that directly. It will be more like an email late Friday evening asking you to fix a problem by 9am Monday. 
** We used to have receptionists in buildings - helpful when you have visitors, that's gone. 
** This may sound mundane, but it is a bad experience for men - they removed water flushes from all men's rooms. It's in the spirit of going green, but the toilets stink - at least they should have more janitorial service, but instead they keep cutting that as well. The janitorial service has picketed in Cisco at least two times to my knowledge.
* There is no face to Human Resources. There is a 408 number is San Jose, but you will be hard pressed to find the number on the intranet. They are making it harder and harder to open cases for anything, probably discouraging you to do so. I heard most of HR has been off-shored.
** We used to get free access to safaribooks, but now departments get charged and so you are not sure of access. This is such a simple perk with huge ROI for Cisco and even that they cut.
** I once opened a case with WPR (Work Place Resources) saying my chair was bad. Some one evaluated it and a week later I got a chair must worse that what I had! 
** When I wanted to move to another group in another building, the Secretary told me not to move because Cisco is not approving moves. I said I am in engineering and cannot work in another building while the rest of the team is in an another one. I was told that it would be better if I moved everything myself otherwise Cisco will end up rejecting the move. I couldn't believe what I was hearing!

I cannot believe Cisco keeps getting voted one of the best places to work for. Everyone I speak with seems to be unhappy. I think a lot of folks stay here because the pay is good and mainly because of family and mortgage commitments  and commute. As an engineer I felt completely unwanted from the day I joined."

-Convenient amenities for SJ employees (health center, gym, daycare, etc)
-Decent benefits package (although healthcare costs rise every year)","-Stagnant pay (won't get a pay increase without a promo, promos are nearly impossible to come by)
-Politics - It isn't what you do, its who you know and how well you can brown nose/take credit for others' work to get ahead
-Consensus based culture - Too many cooks in the kitchen...everyone needs to ""buy off"" on initiatives; creates tremendous bottlenecks to the point of not getting anything accomplished
-Turf wars amongst management - Makes it even more difficult to get ahead and get stuff accomplished
-Unqualified leaders - In the mid-late 90s, when Cisco was growing rapidly, they needed to hire bodies; many were unqualified and lacked even a college degree; now these losers are in leadership positions and have power trips; will backstab to stay ahead, since they know they can't on their abilities alone
-No training/development budget - Continuous learning is difficult when there's no budget at all for training/certifications and conferences/travel
-Generally, old stodgy work environment - Not much camaraderie when many folks are over 50, don't want to work hard and are just collecting their paychecks"

Overall, Cisco is a very well respected company and they try to maintain that level of professionalism with respect to the way employees are treated.  The management team and Human Resources policies certainly are geared toward rewarding the individuals that offer the highest contributions to the business.","The compensation has been going down in recent years.  I say that for several reasons.  First, the salaries have not been going up in general but cost of living, of course, has.  Second, the benefits are slowly getting worse.  The primary one being stock options which have all but been terminated now except for the management and highest level technical folks.  But in addition, the various medical and dental plans offered are covering less and costing more year after year."
Account manager,3.0,"May 28, 2009",Former employee,"Excellent compensation, good health benefits, great telecommuting options for employees that live far away. The Cisco name carries weight and is a great resume builder and a good place to build your network at the beginning of your career.","Unfortunately, after 4 years I didn't see my career transforming to something different, and many of my colleagues felt the same. I wanted to transition from Sales to Marketing, or an international role and got little management support or guidance on how to do this. There is little encouragement for trying new roles not in your direct department. I know many who have left Cisco, gotten other outside experience and then come back in a new role. That was one of the main reasons I left.
Also, there was little work life balance for me. I was handsomely compensated as an Account Manager, but in return, I worked 70-80 hour weeks sometimes, and almost never took vacation. I worked when I was sick, when my parents were ill, etc. It was great that Cisco allowed me to telecommute when I was ill and when my parents were sick, but in return I was expected to be ""connected"" at all times. I took two 10 day vacations during my 4 year tenure at Cisco and had to get permission to leave my cell phone/email off while traveling so I could actually enjoy it. 
Also I didn't really feel it had a ""work hard, play hard"" atmosphere either. I have a small handful of close friends from my Cisco days but besides that, no one in the office really wanted to interact or socialize with each other after work hours so I also left the company with few long lasting relationships, despite my best efforts.

Non-existent decision-making or accountability.  Continuing trend to use committees to make decisions, which continues to promote lack of individual decision-making and accountability by the right people.  When all goes wrong, targeted scapegoating is the result of this framework.

Middle management is not competent.  Many grew up at Cisco during boom (late 90's) and were promoted to mgt (due to low unemployment) without experience, competencies, training or solid role models. No real progress on improving this gap.

Fire, aim, ready mentality.  Lots of fire drills, false starts, rework.

Lots of posturing and heavy politics.  If you can stand to ""hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil"" you will do fine, though you may not help the company.    

Bonus system promotes dishonesty.  Sr. Mgrs and above get significant bonuses.  No wonder they are possessed with everyone creating our ""smoke and mirrors"" deliverables.

No work/life balance.  My Director verbatim ""you will never find a job at Cisco that offers work life balance, so don't bother looking.  All Cisco employees are expected to work 60+hours per week."" At that rate, I can do better financially and personally working for the defunct state of CA.

HR is invisible.  When I asked, my manager would not give me the HR contact and suggested it was useless to get them involved in what would have benefited from HR consultation.  No one in our group knows who our HR rep is as we have never been told, seen or heard from anyone in HR.  There is no place to go to look it up, as far as I know.

Limited opportunity to transition to other groups.  My VP has prevented 2 attempts I have made to move to a different group, even when a job was available for me."
Account manager,4.0,"Oct 11, 2010",Current employee,"1. Cisco folks are smart, experienced, diverse, culturally exposed, very professional and quite friendly. Collaboration is part of daily work and people are willing to help out. 

2. Technology is everywhere, and Cisco eats its own dog food, just not the latest release. The portfolio of products in Cisco will simply amaze people. 

3. Individual contributors are empowered to make critical decisions, access people across the company towards identified goals in a relatively flat hierarchy. 

4. Awesome work life balance, you decide how much you want to work and earn, now with mobility and great tools, where doesn't really matter. You can use Apple, PC, iPhone, BB, Android, IT is heading towards any to any device. Which is great for tech savvy folks 

5. Overall package is average with good medical coverage.","1. Compensation package are sometimes mediocre at best, promotions and pay increments can take eons. Loyalty is rewarded by stagnation in grade level, however we welcome jumpers back with higher grade, pay and recognition. 

2. Personal growth and career can be on both ends of the spectrum, depending on your manager, which team and where ? Markets with high growth reasonably gets resources and attention. 

Along the lines of its acquisition and develop strategy, talent seems to be managed the same way. Rarely find young people in Cisco, mostly IT old timers, reliable and dependable. This makes things dull and mundane at times. 

3. Cisco finds innovative ways to complicate doing business, which in turn complicate most peoples jobs. 

4. Too many initiatives, too many programs, too many tools ""everything in Cisco is online somewhere, if you can find it then great"". 

5. Cisco culture is beginning to be diluted in certain places, from an awesome company its starting to be just another IT company. Yet whats most disturbing is on the surface things are ok."
Software engineer i,4.0,"Oct 15, 2010",Former employee,Technology you get to work on is top-end. It is not just a support site for the US office unlike many other product companies. The work culture is nurturing and allows you to grow without suffocating you with politics. The managers are understanding in your needs.,Appraisals usually do not reflect the performance although the hikes are good enough even though the ratings aren't that great. There is not much emphasis on work-life balance.
It manager,4.0,"Apr 17, 2011",Current employee,"You can make a career of changing jobs and working on different projects within one company.   There's so many ways to make your mark through your successes including creating process improvements, driving higher scalability, and lowering costs along the way.   The company rewards those who make the company more *productive*.  You feel proud to be part of the internet revolution and how we now use it in our personal lives and in business.   If you enjoy immersing yourself into work, you will do well here.   The profit-sharing bonus is great!   You get to work from home liberally as the San Jose campus is so spread out and you can't be expected to drive from building to building and be on time to your meetings.    Nearly everyone now tele-conference calls into a meeting with WebEx.    With WebEx on your smartphone, the word 'work' is no longer a place you go to as it is wherever you are when you have an internet connection.","This is a place for workaholics and folks who want to make things happen.   You're always connected to work because of the internet, email, IM, WebEx, mobile.    Work - life balance... forget about it.    To keep pace, you need to be reading your emails at night and on weekends.  Time to eat lunch during your lunch hour... SELDOM unless you own all the meetings or the meeting can wait for another 2 weeks when you have a more reasonable time that you or the others are available.   These are the hazards of working for a global company when the people you work with are in multiple timezones and don't eat lunch or sleep when you do.    If you find a good boss to work for, enjoy it while it lasts.   On average, you'll have a new boss every 1.5 years.      If you can work in a non-IT role at Cisco, you'll add more years to your life.

One other thing... when there's little given out in salary raises, promotions, big titles, big responsibilities, the politics gets tougher as there's more fighting for so little and less sharing.   Since 2002, this has been an environment with much less rewards than had been there before.   Welcome to big corporate life when you have the usual emphasis in cost cutting!"
Client services manager,4.0,"Aug 16, 2011",Current employee,"When WebEx was purchased by Cisco, we knew there would be a culture shock (hardware meets software as a service).  Cisco was very professional and had more people wearing ties and removed the WebExcess back in 2007.  The training and exposure to the largest most integrated solutions challenged everyone and grew the most professional teams I've worked with to a new and higher levels.

Cisco has been also been another Pro as the integration and stability they have brought thru process and industry best practices in large deployments has been invaluable.","Some of the legacy systems like Oneview (custom service portal), Bliss (custom billing system)  and fax document processing has held WebEx back for years.  Cisco WebEx needs to implement and leverage more self-servicing tools like Sprints.com customer service portal and finish delayed projects like Oracle while also maintaining it's expert communication practices.  

An additional Con is the current expectations set with customers and the major cut back.  It will be nearly impossible for Cisco WebEx remaining staff to meet the new demand for implementation and deployment.  At the end of Cisco's FY11 (July 30th 2011) there was a massive influx and transition type order to the Cisco Global Price List (typically partner oriented deals).  The executive management made cuts based on financial needs and has really put the Cisco WebEx implementation and deployment specialists (aka Client Service Manager's) in a precarious position with very limited and very new specialist.   Top partners like PGi, Intercall, Verizon, AT&T, INX and more will have to deploy, implement and service these accounts with little to no help."

Chambers blew it with Wall Street but  the board gave him his job again for 3 years which is something many employees don't understand since all stock options are under water and stock options are gone. The story of being easier to do business with Cisco is complete BS at the transaction level as there are no changes in process to get deals done. If you complain at Cisco you are put on a black list by executives. They don't want to hear bad news so why complain if you want to protect your career?"
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Oct 23, 2011",Current employee,"Cisco provides a multitude of opportunities to expand your skills, knowledge and professional contacts.  The opportunity it there to make a difference, add value to the corporation.  The pay and benefits are exceptional.",Management slow to react to shifts in the market in demand for technology and competition.

Anonymous employee,4.0,"Nov 22, 2011",Current employee,"Cisco is a great place to develop technical knowledge, communicate with smart people, and advance a career. There are wonderful tools for collaboration and management is very supportive of employees.","Cisco is very big, and feels even bigger. The organization structure is complicated and yet it must be understood in order to be an effective employee. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. And different business units are in constant competition with one another, frequently for internal attention and resources, and sometimes in the external marketplace too. Senior management doesn't seem to understand technology and industry strategy, at least not well enough to make difficult decisions and provide real leadership. After a year on the job, I'm still not really sure how to make a difference and create value for the company.

On a more personal level, while I'm satisfied with the salary and bonus structure at Cisco, I'm unhappy to find that the benefits are not as good as my previous employer. The health insurance plans are expensive and don't provide any significant benefits unless they're heavily used, because of deductibles, co-pays, etc. Frankly, I'd be willing to pay higher employee contributions for a better plan, but my previous employer's plan was better and less expensive.

The vacation / PTO allowance is pretty standard, but after starting with Cisco I found out that there are ""mandatory PTO"" days at the end of each year. In other words, some PTO days (approx 3 per year) are not available for the employee to use as they wish, but are effectively ""holiday"" days. Since my previous employer gave me 5 days more than Cisco (actually 10 days more than Cisco, due to my tenure; 5 days more for new employees), I was already expecting a step backwards - the mandatory PTO just makes it worse."

-unreasonable target"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jan 26, 2013","Former employee, more than 8 years",Cisco develops cutting edge products and implements them internally often making employees beta users (fun and frustrating).  Encouraging early adoption of new technologies benefits employees by making them  savvy tech users across a broad range of technologies compared to peers.  Working for Cisco commands a lot of respect from people outside the company.  You have great 24-hour global emergency support whether you're on business or travel.,"There's been a steep, and documented, decline in compensation in last 10 years.  No raises unless you're promoted.  Promotions are limited to approximately 15-20% of the workforce and are a 12-18 month cycle once your manager gets you in the queue.  Couple this with the elimination of stock options for the majority of employees who are rated as meeting expectations (around 60% of the workforce) and uncertain bonuses means you lose money staying at Cisco unless you're on and stay on the promotion track.  It's no secret that Cisco has a substantial chunk of cash which it keeps off-shore to minimize US taxes.  While ""good"" for the bottom line this strategy also penalizes US employees because it keeps the pool of money for promos and raises small.  The hours are relentless regardless of your role. It's not unusual to receive emails from peers in your time zone at 11:00 or 11:30 pm.  There's subtle pressure to respond to emails from peers in other regions during their workday a.k.a. your evening.  Working partial days on the weekend isn't uncommon and working Sunday evenings is standard.  Training and education is under-funded. I was not approved for any professional training in the last five years of employment at Cisco."
Project manager,4.0,"Mar 29, 2013","Current employee, more than 3 years","Being part of Cisco has, literally, been a life-changing opportunity & journey for me. I can't imagine myself anywhere else. 

Constant, sincere & authentic commitment to customers...at all levels of business, this is always and without question the top priority and decision-driver! I've worked at other companies that talked this same talk, but didn't back it up with practice or action. It's one of, if not the top,, reasons that I always feel proud to say ""I work at Cisco"". 
OTHER: Flex-scheduling; remote work options; autonomy; intelligent, curious, committed and passionate colleagues; organizational integrity; $10k annual education reimbursement.","Cisco offers lots of opportunity for lateral movement across org's & functions- which is great for those of us who like to keep learning and want broader organizational knowledge. The downfall of this, however, is FREQUENT management changes. There are also major re-org's every few years, also resulting in movement and changes in team structure/management. For many of us, our managers substantially influence employ,net decisions and ultimate job satisfaction. Unfortunately, at Cisco, you can't really base decisions on this because it could change tomorrow. 

Cisco's top-heavy. Congestion in higher job grades makes upward movement slow and difficult, even if deserving, because there are already so many people in these grades that it's difficult to justify adding another. 

Underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, particularly at Mngr, Snr Mngr, & Director level. Cisco's said this is a focus area, and while there hasn't been much change at most levels, we are seeing women fill the ranks at VP & SVP.  

Cisco's huge. Ramping-up as new-hire takes long time- learning all diff efferent org's, acronyms, functions, etc. (But it's worth it.)

Lacking generational diversity. Based on my observations only... small percentage of employees under 30. I'd guess avg age Is about 40-45. 

Pressure to perform and emphasis on results, means you have to market yourself. At times, I've definitely thought to myself ""I could achieve so much more if I didn't have to spend all this time communicating my 'wins'"".

Large company ability to rotate and learn new things

Excellent pay - Cisco strives to pay at the 75th percentile, pretty good benefits

Great place to work and advance for women

Bonuses are usually paid out or in bad years a portion of the bonus.

If you do get laid off and are a blue badge (non-contractor employee) you will get a generous severance package - in 2011 it was a 6 month payout for most, but for long term older employees it was 1 year.  In 2013 the package was something very similar two months on the books - paid with a four month payout.

If you don't have a brand name school on impressive company your resume, people will take you more serious after doing time at Cisco.

The possibility of driving important initiatives of very significant size - the ability to impact millions of dollars of revenue or be part of a billion dollar business unit or enterprise.

A great cross cultural - world-wide and cutting edge technology experience.","If you are a red badge (contractor) in the USA- odds are you will never become a full time employee with benefits. Back in 2011, 40% of the company was contract, today it is higher.  Many have the dreams and desires to convert from contractor to employee but your odds are almost as good as playing the lotto.  (If you are a women, your odds will be better - as you will help the desired diversity metrics).

Raises almost never happen.  They are the exception and not the rule.

Continual layoffs of higher paying positions - almost every year - cost shifting of higher paying jobs to lower paying areas outside of Bay Area/USA.  

Each job has very limited role responsibility because they are typically structured in a silo - so after two years you might get bored and will want to go through the job rotation program.

Some departments had VERY inflated job titles compared with the outside world. I have met Directors and Senior Directors that I wouldn't let them run a McDonalds (if I owned one). As they say in Texas - all hat and no cattle.  

If you are a straight white male not in engineering it's not the best place to advance - you will have difficulties in advancing because you will not meet the desired diversity quota. Because engineering is so heavily weighted toward men, the other areas of the business are being strongly encouraged to hire women. I've seen entire departments shift from 50/50 to 75/80% women. Many of the women prefer only to hire women. The women dominated departments are creating new issues which I had never seen before in any organization and in certain cases slows down progress. While I support the advancement of women, some things are hard to challenge, change or modify without coming across as a Neanderthal.  (I hope they balance things out better in the future). 

The LGBT agenda can create a hostile environment after the inclusion and diversity on the annual review implemented by a previous HR exec who is now at Twitter. The review now can be used against those that have more traditional views of the world. It creates and Orwellian world where the word inclusion means exclusion.

If you work at Cisco too long you might become immersed in the slow ""collaborative"" bureaucratic way of doing things where nothing gets done and perhaps lose your ability to act and think quickly."

There are 4 'culls' every year, roughly every 3 months which are usually small but have increased to 20+ people in the last year. This has lead to a more negative atmosphere in the last couple of years.
    
    If you're unlucky and end up in the wrong team, you could be working with mangers and colleagues who look after number one and hide their ineptitude and bad behaviour from those above, whilst making themselves look good off the back of other people.
Complaining to HR doesn't do any good, they're still there. It doesn't help there's no local HR department, as they were 'no longer needed' over a year ago."

Firstly, you can learn a lot about technology, sales and soft skills from formal learning and on-the-job experience. 

Secondly, you're surrounded by an international and diverse group of young professionals, which teaches you about dealing and understanding different cultures. Also, you build a very strong network around the world. 

Finally, you receive competitive salary and benefits while training.",The training might feel detached from the every-day reality of your first position after the program. It will eventually make sense when you earn more experience and progress in your career.

-Great company culture

It depends a lot on the team you land, but the culture is great. We go out on team dinner very frequently. Even though the company is huge, at some moments, it feels like you are part of a startup within your team.","Because the company is based out in Silicon Valley, they have a lot of competition when it comes to employee perks.

In all cases you will find something for you. When it comes to carrier boosting - it depends. Cisco is a company of ""visibilities"" and ""egoism"" - if you do the right things, you will get your promotion, otherwise you will ""die"" in humble circumstances and nobody will sorrow about it.

If you are a student, less than 30 years old, have no family, you have a passion for technology so strong, that you are ready to work overtime (of course for free) - this place is right for you.","Here ""good job"", ""fantastic results"", ""keep up"" phrases mean nothing, at least for management. Cisco is a cruel and bloody business machine. You can rag to riches to rag in few months if you do or don't do the right things. You may work very well, receiving glorious feedbacks from Customers - all it is taken for granted.

You will not see promotion unless you make something really fabulous, thus you will be noticed by Top Management - for example you will visit CiscoLive with your own presentation. Practically it is an easy and very dainty way for Tech Leads, since they are not expected to work ""on shift"" all the day long. Tech Leads of course supposed to have other responsibilities being an escalation, but who cares that they don't - management adopted a laissez-faire attitude long time ago. As a result bum engineers trample over each other just to get to TechLead paradise.

All above is about Cisco TAC/HTTS and at the end of the day it is my personal opinion only."

Associate account manager,5.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is a great place to work. Coming out of college I was looking for an employer that would not only be financially rewarding in the short term, but also a company that would add value to me as a person and a worker. As such I was extremely pleased to be accepted into the Cisco Sales Associate Program, a year long training program that provides technical training, teaches sales skills and business acumen. The training was excellent and I feel well prepared now that I'm in a full time sales role. The pay's great, the opportunity for Cisco and it's employees is incredible, and I'm looking forward to a bright future ahead of me with Cisco. Most compelling however is the quality of people I work with. I've been thoroughly impressed with the diversity of experience and strong wills within the sales organization. All in all Cisco's a great place to start a career and I couldn't be happier.","Needless to say the great rewards are a result of great demands. This means often working long hours, particularly as a new salesman. However, I wouldn't rate it as excessive or unreasonable given the position. In addition to demands on time, they demand results. This means occasionally employees are let go for underperforming, and some people are uncomfortable with such quantitative metrics. Moreover, if you're not too interested in technology and what it can do for businesses, schools, governments, and individual's lives, then obviously Cisco's not the place to be. I would imagine as well that when Cisco was primarily a route/switch vendor it was harder to get excited about the technology, but now everyone from Jack Bauer to Michael Scott's using our stuff."

Any efficiencies and ROI's that may have been gained are lost with rework, work around processes and partner/customer damage control.

The most amusing power struggles and political positioning of SVP, AVP, Directors, etc.  There was a day at Cisco when John Chambers wanted no more than four levels of management down from CEO.  There are more VPs than a bank and just as much distrust, self-absorption, and lack of true leaders.  

Programs are funded in multiple departments to develop and deploy the same end goal resulting in overlap and confusion.  These initiatives have elaborate benchmarks, milestones, etc. in which the program teams must meet the red, yellow, or green milestone whether it has any business relevance or not.

Still huge parity in the best, most qualified individual with equitable compensation and compliance with federal diversity metrics for tax considerations.  Employee performance and goal attainment is very subjective.  If you are not identified for advancement, your compensation and success is easily manipulated towards marginal or worse non-performance.

Do not expect to be given credit for process improvement recommendations, lead generation, best practices, etc. as you are not socialized or given credit for it to executive management.  You will often see 'golden ones' given accolades for your creativity.

All internal moves are lateral even if the job has increased job responsibilities and advanced skill sets.  Salaries are not competitive with industry and increases are based partially on epm ratings.  The problem here is managers are given a certain number of X and E+ ratings for their reports.

Many teams have taken defensive positions to eliminate work or ownership of product growth and development. The product is circling the drain and no one seems to care. For a period a renewals team didn't exist and customers were simply canceled, and canceled without warning. The product looks as it did 7 years ago and any efforts to introduce new features has resulted in a huge number of bugs (customers treated as beta testers), undocumented features, and usability issues.

There are a significant number of long-term Cisco managers, occupying roles for 15 years or more, managers who seem lost in a Dilbert comic. Able but unwilling to enact change, making sure to not rock the boat or do anything to actually improve the products they're part of.

Products are extremely complex, developed by engineers for engineers, with no focus on usability or the human experience.

Back to the culture being broken, they have been doing large layoffs for the past few years, I have lost track how many, and it is not just bottom 5% type layoffs, which is why it is like Game of Thrones, you have organizational leaders trying to save their high paying fiefdoms, and it paid in the blood of the field.

Many opportunities for development like training, mentorship or shadowing. However this requires initiative from you, don’t expect anyone else to handle your career development for you. Often the company can sponsor industry certifications like PMP or ITIL.

You can’t really expect quick and regular salary advances and promotions. In my experience, you will need to consistently perform above your level, plus the timing and budget must be favorable. In other words, hard work plus a bit of luck are needed. Some employees are obviously performing above their level and waiting for the right recognition.

Being accepted for who you are and being encouraged to bring your whole self to work is another plus. Giving back is a huge priority for Cisco and everyone is encouraged to get involved in volunteering which I love!,Flexible working conditions mean sometimes it does feel like you are 'always on' but it's a small price to pay for being able to fit work into your life rather than fit your life around your work.
Customer service engineer,5.0,"Nov 30, 2018","Current employee, more than 5 years","Great and evolving culture where you are encouraged to bring your ""whole self"" to work. Especially awesome are the Employee Resource Organizations that celebrate employee diversity and inclusion.

Systems engineering manager,5.0,"Nov 30, 2018","Current employee, more than 8 years","Cisco is a great company! I have worked at many different companies including start-ups and other mature companies. I will be at Cisco until I retire. Cisco does an outstanding job at giving employees the freedom to deliver to their full potential and rewards excellence. Many companies claim to encourage upward mobility but never deliver. Cisco has an incredible amount of opportunity and every leader I have encountered at Cisco actively encourages her or his team member to prepare for the next role. Additionally, There are many avenues to share your ideas and execute on them if they make sense.

Cisco celebrates diversity and has “ERO” groups to connect people of different backgrounds with each other. As an Air Force veteran, I am a member of the “Veteran ERO” and am always uplifted by the many initiatives and opportunities we have to celebrate our fellow Veterans and fallen Heroes.

Lastly, I have never been at a company that has such an incredible culture of lifting each other up!  We all need help and advice at times (in technology, probably more often than in other industries!). Most other companies have a few people you know will help you and not make you feel like a burden. At Cisco, it is RARE to find someone who is not overly eager to help, point you to someone who will help, or help you find the right resources. It is humbling to ask a question and immediately be in touch with someone who authored the book on a subject!

As a large and successful corporation, benefits are very good and employees are given the necessary resources to succeed. We work on the newest technologies, with modern processes that help Cisco (and us as employees) to stay ahead of the curve!","If you are not accustomed to change, you may have some challenge getting used to work at Cisco. Our leadership does a great job of staying relevant in the industry (our market share and market cap shows this). To do this, we are in a constant state of change. You basically have to hold on tight and enjoy the ride!"
Telepresence engineer,2.0,"May 8, 2019",Former employee,Cisco has an awesome reputation to it is definately a resume builder and you learn some valueble skills.,Crabs in a bucket culture due to the fact there are limited FTE positions everyone is mostly contractor. So when a FTE position comes along it is a volitile place. Some leadership/ Team leads are may be good at the technical but are not good at being a team lead or leading a team. That caused a lot of turmoil with in the group.
Program manager,5.0,"Jun 18, 2019","Current employee, more than 5 years","Cisco is the best place I have worked for, after several other big companies in Krakow, in overall 13 years.

What I value most is the flexibility of the working conditions, I can work both from home and the office, there is no micromanagement, I feel the independence and I value that the hard work is being appreciated here. I also like the diversity and multicultural environment.",Cannot think of any cons at the moment.

Technical consulting engineer,5.0,"Jul 31, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","I have been working for Cisco for more than 2 years now. I joined Cisco straight out of college.
I will forever be grateful to Cisco for helping me build myself from scratch. 
Even though I am here on Glassdoor looking for a job switch now, I am amused to see how high my standards have become, all because the way I am treated here at Cisco.
They might not be paying me as much as I want but they sure are treating me well.

> Best work culture ever. Saying this based on what I hear from friends working in other companies.
> You will know they actually care about you and Cisco will go out of its way to show it to you.
> Excellent leadership team, their ideas and visions flow through the entire company and keep us all on the right path.
> Got to learn a lot in the past 2 years, all thanks to the management and teammates.
> Satisfactory compensation.","The role that I am in is customer-facing and with a support role, comes its own challenges. Everyone knows Cisco TAC and appreciates it for the work we do. At the same time, being a TAC engineer can get exhausting for the following reasons.

1. We are supposed to work 8 hours a day but the amount of work can never be wrapped up in that time. Even though we hand off after our shifts, you will always have work pending on you.
2. Escalations may exhaust you now and then.
3. In the past 2 years that I have spent here, I have only heard of cost-cutting measures taken to save the business and keep it growing. Although I understand the decisions taken from a business point of view, but they still need to make promotions more frequent and rewarding.
4. The sheer amount of talent present in Cisco makes it very hard for you to get promoted. Doing your day-to-day job well is not good enough, you have to show the extra efforts you have put in to get promoted. This kind of challenging work environment is great for growth as long as the promotion we get justifies the efforts.
6. Seen senior talent leave for the above reason."

Sales,5.0,"Jul 20, 2022","Current employee, more than 8 years","If you look at work over a 3 yr timeframe I would say Cisco is a better place to work then most. I have seen peers leave and the grass is usually greener for 1-3 yrs then they bounce a few times until they finally find a great home in 5-6 yrs after they left. Work, life, balance, culture, & opportuities are amazing. They give us the tools to succeed. Cisco truly cares about its employees and does it best. We do mess up at times but they address it over time and put in actions to improve whatever that was.","Every 3 yrs sales reps usually have a very bad year b/c growth leads to an unrealistic goal, then you bomb that year and it comes back down to earth. Cisco needs to find a way to fix that b/c we lose good reps who know they have a year with no way to exceed goal and make little money. For those looking to work at Cisco we only make real money after we exceed goal. Only get paid 1% of revenue til then which is underpaid. For those who exceed, you can make great money. Also note 2/3's of my peers always exceed goal so most goals are realistic at least every 3 yrs.
Temp note for 2022 and 23: every rep is on a deferred payment program for 1-2 years due to supply chain (we get paid when items ship). If you don't have money in the bank to get you through the hard times, don't consider working here for a few years as 50% of our comp is hardware. FYI"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jul 27, 2022","Former employee, more than 3 years",Typically surrounded by people committed to the same role and the company will present a ton of “benefits” for you.,It’s all fluff. You will not be making commission because nothing ships for anywhere from 6-20 months. Sometimes more. The salary isn’t near good enough to offset that. Worked there for 4 years and made less in year 3/4 than year 2. This was while overachieving every quarter/year and getting raises… sometimes. Also don’t expect raises even with inflation rates.
Senior marketing manager,3.0,"Apr 20, 2008",Current employee,"Industry Leader.  Still a growth company.  There are pockets of good people and good leaders.  Broad product portfolio.  Broad coverage of markets including consumer, enterprise, SMB and mid-market, which means more growth opportunities for employees.  Location of San Jose, CA is also good as it is the mecca of high tech and attracts many great smart driven professionals.  People do seem to be collaborative, more so in some of the other companies.  Work life balance is being addressed more than other companies I've worked for and people do have the flexibility to work from home when needed and some people telecommute most of the time.","Too big.  Beauracracy.  Seniority matters more than results.  Bad for young talents.  I see innovation being stifled because it takes many councils and boards for the company to make up their mind.  Compare this with Google or other more innovative companies, the structure of councils is really slowing things down and often time doesn't necessarily foster collaboration, rather it has fostered passive agressiveness, walking thru the formality etc.  I've seen executives in disagreements in reality but always try to put on a facade of collaboration in these council meetings.  It's disgusting.  the folks in the trenches are good, but they are not empowered."

Software engineer ii,3.0,"Mar 23, 2009",Current employee,"The work-life balance in general is pretty good(of course that may vary depending upon the team and management). Engineering deadlines are not very aggressive and cisco puts enough resources so that employees do not have to sacrifice the personal commitments for projects. The growth is good especially if one joins from outside with 5+ years of experience.

Senior Leaders from across the globe frequently visit India and hold ""All Hands Meets"" to give market updates and the position of Cisco and its products in the market.

If one is interested in corporate social responsibilities, then cisco provides ample opportunities. There are about 20+ NGOs to which cisco India contributes.","The salary package offered to New Hires(of even top Universities in India) are not competent compared to many other companies with same brand value. If one joins Cisco from outside, the salaries can be pretty high depending upon one's current salary.
Most of the Cisco core products(routers & switches) are stable,  there is more of maintenance work than new development. 
I will not recommend some one who intends to start career at cisco India. This is a good place to work after gaining some experience in some company working on new products which provide ample opportunities to work on new product development."

- Great CEO who knows how to make money","Cisco was probably the place to be in the 90's but not today. The work culture and environment is very hierarchical and bureaucratic; and worse no one seems to care about this. Old time employees are lackadaisical, out of touch and downright incompetent as team players. Another thing I've noticed is forming of ""clans"". I came from a company where despite the office politics when it came down to ""getting it done"" everybody worked together as a team. I am absolutely certain that this would never happen here, in fact, other teams would be glad if another team fails to deliver as this would look good in front of superiors. Managers here are extremely mediocre, which makes me wonder if they've ever had management training. The development tools for software engineers are from the Jurassic age (all command line) and the usual answer I get is ""you'll get used to it"". I mean, are you serious? I spend most of my time learning such archaic tools which has nothing to do with my daily job is pathetic. At least recognize that this is 2012 and people shouldn't be wasting time wrestling with command line utilities to get their job done. And don't tell me that real programmers use command line tools; there is a reason why GUI development tools exist and it is to stop wasting useless cycles jumping from one directory to another and running one script after the other doing trivial tasks.

If you're a new grad do not consider coming to Cisco, you will have no decent mentors and will be left on your own to fend for yourself. This is extremely sad since the products indeed are class leading and there is a lot to learn from senior employees but they are unwilling to share their accumulated knowledge."

3. Engineering org is predominantly male and engineering  leadership is almost universally male. It's easy to get used to men talking over you in meetings,  and promoting your ideas as their own.

Sales engineer,3.0,"Mar 7, 2019","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco was rated in the top 10 places to work.  It has a great work life balance.  It’s huge.  Some good people.  Chuck seems to be doing a good job turning it into a software company. If you are hired into one of the new software units that Cisco acquired, you made a great choice!  You are working with some of the best talent in the world and your growth is boundless. It will be hard work but extremely rewarding.","The startup mentality is gone!  The offices for Cisco employees are bland and do not have any employee snacks like the top companies out there.  Newly acquired companies have better cultures and work harder. Cisco employees are paid a lot less than the company employees they acquire.  Cisco is aquirimg some fantastic companies so this says a lot.  I’m in sales for appdynamics Cisco and the amount of preparation, pride and strategy that go into every deal is phenomenal.  I’ve noticed many from the Cisco sales side “show up and throw up” ... in other words they are not prepared.  On the hardware side There are many that are there for just a job and there is no ambition."
Software engineer,3.0,"Mar 16, 2019","Former employee, more than 8 years","Flexible work schedule. Great benefits. Good work/life balance. ""Family first"" approach. Diverse workforce. Many opportunities to attend training and conferences. Worked there for 9 years and was promoted 3 times with 2 raises outside promotions.","Engineering management varies widely between locations. My first 7 years were with a business unit where I had a great experience and was appreciated and promoted several times. Management was supportive and seemed truly invested in my career development and work/life balance. Development was team oriented with lots of collaboration and support from peers. 

Then I made an unfortunate lateral move to another business unit in another city with some major issues I did not anticipate. Engineering staff there had serious morale issues. My peers were constantly ""joking"" about how terrible the product we were all working on was. At first I wondered why nobody did anything to just fix the issues. After working there a while I realized it was because the engineers have practically zero ability to effect change in the product. So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the benefits are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that. Meanwhile the younger engineers are leaving because the environment is pretty awful. 

Having your own hard-wall office seems great at first until you realize you hardly ever collaborate with the people on your team. On my project the standard practice was to assign a single engineer to develop a feature, write tests, and perform QA in practical isolation. As you can imagine this was pretty stressful and didn't work very well, resulting in buggy products due to lack of a dedicated QA team. Asking for help on an engineering issue was usually like pulling teeth because you had to pull other engineers away from their work to collaborate. Management was not receptive of suggestions to change the status quo to alleviate these issues. My manager frequently missed our weekly one-on-one meetings, sometimes for several weeks in a row. When I attempted to reschedule these missed meetings my requests were frequently ignored. I know of at least 5 other engineers that left the org within a few months of when I did due to the increasingly toxic environment."

Data scientist,3.0,"Apr 18, 2021","Current employee, more than 1 year","1. Intellectually curious, driven and hard-working people (if you know where to look)

2. Everybody talks about this and this is in-part true: balancing life with professional obligations is easier than in certain sectors of the industry

3. Interesting projects in the security domain. For example, if you are interested in applying theory from high-dimensional statistics, signal processing, stochastic processes, causal inference and survival analysis there are many novel projects that you can get involved in.","As a data scientist here are some observations:

1. Bureaucracy and red tape for accessing data and understanding data - primarily because of disjoint business groups and over-reliance on data warehousing consultants in India (Tata etc.)

2. Actual implementation of solutions that use data is exceedingly difficult. Certain business units of Cisco are on various parts of the spectrum of ML Operations and data infrastructure. Thus, these same business units are on varying spectrums for data science integrations into their services and products. Consistently, however, technical resourcing for data science teams, competent leadership with experience in deploying models and product management for data products is a deficit that impedes impact.

3. Related to (2) - cultural changes and frequent reorganizations interrupt or disrupt continuity of development of data science projects or actual production implementation of solutions.

4. Lack of investment in data infrastructure. Cisco’s engineering and data scientist teams (sans the acquisitions) are still mired in “software development” mindsets. There is little understanding or awareness be senior management and technical leaders of the challenges or workflow of data science projects and challenges with hard data science problems. 

5. All of the above is not abetted by a culture of sales and feature factories for current products - both legacy and SaaS."
Project manager,5.0,"Sep 8, 2021","Current employee, more than 3 years","Amazing work culture with great perks. Bangalore campus is just woww.

Flexible work hours and lots of Wfh. Attrition is less at Cisco for all the above said reasons and no surprises that it tops the list for “Best place to work for”.","LR - Even though a few BUs are lucky to be not impacted (like the one I am in), employees do have a fear waiting for their turn.

Team leader,5.0,"Apr 5, 2022","Current employee, more than 10 years","Generally a good culture, rewards and benefits are up there with the other top companies, good remote work and self management practices. Very high quality of employees - intelligent driven collaborative. Good CXO level leadership has moved the company to recurring revenue model and set it up for longer term sustainability",Had a bad habit of annual layoffs (seems to be discontinued now) - pockets of poor leadership at the VP level
Senior hardware engineer,4.0,"May 29, 2008",Former employee,"Like any big company, your job experience at Cisco will vary from group to group. The ideal situation in Cisco is to join a group which already has good mix of engineers at every level, and a strong upwardly mobile manager who trusts you and manages upwards well. If you can find this opportunity, and perform well, you will have the best career prospects. 
That said, the best thing about working for Cisco might just be that you if you are a competent and productive engineer, you have quite a bit of flexibility in defining your role and your contribution level. If you are really gunning for promotions, look for a good group, find a niche, take on roles that are difficult or un-wanted, and work your rear end off. If you want to coast and balance your time between work and other interests, then find a steady group, manage your time well, and you can stay safe in your job with just about 40 hours of work a week... and you might have the flexibility to telecommute or work from home.
Another note - Cisco is a great place for competent women. There is a strong network of women employees and a tradition of mentorship, that really helps career growth.","The down-side of working at Cisco is that the salary is not great. And promotions & bonuses can get very competitive at the senior level. So, if end up in a group that is over-loaded with good people at your level and above, then you can get stuck in a situation where you are working hard but not getting enough rewards, bonus, or visibility.
Actually, getting stuck in the wrong group can be a pretty bad experience over the long term. Talk to people and do your research before you accept any offer. 
Your manager is also very important. There are two types of managers you want to avoid. One (relatively rare) will use you to get ahead but not give you a fair share of recognition. The other (more common) one is a  manager who is so swamped and has such little management insight / experience, that he or she is not able to help you with adequate guidance, especially when it comes to career development and growth. 
There is one other danger I must mention. This applies even in 'good' groups. There is a tendency at Cisco to just keep loading you with more and more responsibilities until you actually stand up and say enough. If this is an interesting job, you might find that you are spending more time on work than you had originally planned, at the expense of family, friends, etc. So decide for yourself how much you want to work and what your goals are. And then be prepared to work with your management to define the appropriate role. 
No one will come and ask you what you want at Cisco. You have to decide that for yourself, and then communicate it to your management.
Also, if you do end up in a bad situation, be prepared to make an honest assessment of the situation and leave. No one likes to quit, but if you end up staying 5 or 6 years without fair rewards, you will find yourself falling well behind people who were your peers when you started... and this is really not a good experience."
Software engineer intern,4.0,"Jun 17, 2008",Current employee,"As an intern, I hear a lot of things from other interns all over the company. I think we all agree that Cisco's New Hire Network does a great job of getting us settled in and offering workshops with advice on making the most of our time here. The administrative tasks during the first few weeks were very fluid for such a large company. I was very impressed.

San Jose is a great place to live. I love scenery, the traffic (or lack thereof), the very accessible and omnipresent public transportation (which Cisco pays for), and, of cours, the California weather. Most of the interns, as well as many of the full time employees, live in an apartment community located in the middle of Cisco's campus. Every morning, I walk to the nearest Cisco building and take the campus shuttle to my building. Best commute ever.

Before I got here, I was afraid that I would end up doing menial tasks like getting people coffee, even though Cisco and every other company I applied to ensured us that would not be the case. I was given a couple of small projects at first; however, I didn't feel like I was contributing enough, so I asked for something else, and my manager quickly found bigger project for me! :-) The project my particular group is working has a life cycle of about four months, so I'm really excited that I get to see most of it!

I can't say much about work/life balance for full time employees, but we interns are having the time of our lives here. We have something planned almost every night (e.g. free salsa lessons on Thursdays down in Japantown), and I've visited many of my CS friends at other companies in Silicon Valley. If anything, there's more of a life/sleep balance issue.","I cannot believe ""frugality"" is so strongly emphasized. Is it really necessary?

The salary is great compared to that of other engineering internships, but college students tend to rank companies by how much they can afford to pay their interns."
Systems engineer iii,2.0,"Sep 3, 2008",Former employee,"When I joined Cisco, they were able to attract ""type A"" personalities who were generally bright, self-motivated individuals. There was unspoken but obvious competition to be he most knowledgeable in ones chosen field and the most successful both for and with their customers and partners.
Together with the reputation that Cisco had in the industry, and the strong leadership in marketing that allows Cisco to punch way above their products weight, there was always a feeling that anything was possible.
The level of employee empowerment and IT systems were incredible, and no excuses were tolerated.
Senior leadership team was strong at the time.","Stock options did not perform and were always intended to be a supplement to the relatively poor basic salary - these did not perform as projected.
Compensation was not comparable to those packages available on the San Jose campus.
The matrix management scheme was full of inexperienced middle managers, who had little or no people management skills.
Technical staff were offered no advancement beyond a certain level of income / staff grading. The only options to earn more money were to become an account manager, despite several senior directors having been home grown from the technical side of the business.
New recruits were given higher salaries to start and better grades, which obviously was a bitter pill to swallow for the more experienced and therefore more productive employees.(Cisco is a big company and it takes a couple of years to build the relationships necessary to deliver value)
Quality of new entrants to the organisation is somewhat lower now than when I was recruited.
Failure was rewarded with promotion, provided you could spin it the right way and kiss the right butts.
Nepotism was rife - not the place to work if you are a workaholic - it will bury you."
Senior manager,4.0,"Nov 17, 2008",Current employee,"The pay is good, though in the Bay Area it never seems to be enough. The benefits package, however, is great, especially if you have a family, and the new central gym/clinic/juice bar/pharmacy facility is amazing.  A dominant company with plenty of cash in the bank, it's definitely a good place to be in this economy.  
Training is encouraged and widely available and people seem to be encouraged to change roles every couple of years.  If you want to get a flavor for a lot of different aspects of the business, its possible to do.
At least in my org, there's some flexibility on hours and work location - working from home on Fridays has never been an issue.  
Its also great to work with people who have interests and concerns aside from just making money, and impressed with the amount of philanthropy and volunteerism.  Most of the people here seem genuinely smart.","The politics.  It seems the only way that people move up is to make their sphere of influence greater, not do a good job with what they are already have.  So forget trying to get into a job and start kicking ass - its all about managing expectations and having a few wins, and then spinning the results.  Everyone takes pride in the company's innovation, but I think we're mostly riding on past reputation, and improving products we already have.  While we've done a great job promoting TelePresence, its not exactly a new idea - we just improved on it.
Part of the problem with the politics is that its difficult to move up once you get to say Sr. Manager/Manager level.  It isn't clear what the requirements are to develop your career, and people aren't always willing to develop their direct reports for fear that then they'll take over their job.
The boards and councils that drive many of the initiatives are all executive driven, and its isn't clear at all that they are productive.  Its tough to get everyone on the calendar at the same time, and it doesn't seem that they want to do any delegating to those of us further down the chain."
Technical marketing engineer,3.0,"Nov 25, 2008",Current employee,Learn a lot in a short amount of time.,There are a lot of employees that have been at Cisco for a long time and are set for life due to stocks.  Some (not all) of these employees now contribute nothing to the company and are just milking it.  This makes work difficult for the rest of their team members who are helpless to do anything about it.
Web project lead (title has little to do with my real job),4.0,"Mar 8, 2009",Current employee,"I just passed my 10 year anniversary and am still proud to work at Cisco. The benefits are varied and quite good, lots of vacation earned (6.16 hrs / pay period) and caps at 280 hours. Lots of non-monetary rewards like gymnasium, child care, dry cleaning, car wash, new medical facility, free soda and water (although not for long), and telecommuting options (although this varies greatly by group and manager), the pay for my monthly home broadband too ($62/month). Lots of on-line education and the tuition reimbursement is great ($7500/year). Fortunately I work in a fairly decent group (marketing) with minimal politics except for a few highly volitle people. I have an engineering background so like the mix of business and technical. If you're a technical person, it's a pretty good gig.","I don't know where the many people who wrote reviews here work who said there is good work/life balance because I've never seen it. I have never worked less than 55 hrs/week and often 80+ hrs.  There absolutely are duds here who are great at talking non-stop and so get recognized but they don't do anything. I get frustrated working at a high tech company and constantly get asked stupid questions about how to use Excel or PowerPoint or things they can easily look up themselves. How can someone get a job here and not know computer basics is beyond me. Just because they're busy doesn't mean they're productive (basic computer skills would be a great improvement).

I also don't like the performance review system which many others mentioned. It's an absolute joke (and not a good one). Your score has little to do with the quality of your work, but how much your manager likes you, how much work s/he is willing to do to help you get ahead, and how lazy they are. I've had managers tell me they never give an X (the highest score) no matter what you do and everyone gets the same rating because it's easier for the manager. I was fortunate to finally get a promotion last year (and two raises) but it was a horrific, butt-kissing process. I've had over 15 CAP awards over the years but none of that seems to matter. You can do the exact same work for manager A and get a E score but then move to manager B and get an X, it makes no sense and there is no oversight or standards."

-Lack of direction and attention from the management, since the managers also busy working to make their bosses happy so don't expect they can take good care of the individual contributors like the engineers
-Must have the super silky smooth talkative skills like Obama in order to shine your boss's shoes and make them happy to win their trust and get good impression, again, doesn't mean you can get promotion but for some reason you would think that you need to do that.

Compensation and benefits are great but more importantly, Cisco recognize the importance employee satisfaction. Interactions with Cisco feel human and personal.

Mobility is a reality here, the workforce and teams are global but work seamlessly.

The company values are very simple - to put it briefly, they focus on integrity and respect.

Highly recommended!",I can't think of any.
Program manager,2.0,"Jan 7, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Job Security is above average. Befits are good, Choices for Health Life, Dental and Vision. Stock options are not offered anymore. Employee stock purchase program is good. Training and education are Very good. Diverse culture. Employee's are encouraged to expand and move out of their box into other areas to get ahead. Salary is average or just above average. Cisco is a VERY very large company so experiences and situations will vary depending on location. In The United States, East Coast RTP TAC has some of the  most intelligent people on earth. They are good at what they do and they enjoy doing it.","Compensation is lacking. Once you branch out of the lower levels such as support you start to run into road blocks. The company is VERY political internally. Management is great , above average at talk on ideas and planning but lacks the ability to create a complete strategy and execute on it. The company as of 2014 is facing its greatest challenge. Share holders want to see double digit returns on the core business, Routing and Switching. These are based on bare metal products. Bare metal is going away. Amazon and Google have already eroded some of this. Cisco does have a cloud strategy however its late unproven, and complex and full of issues. Cisco will fall behind in 2014 so do not expect a great deal of hiring. Bonus Compensation is based on performance and for FY13 this was sub par. Looking into FY14 this trend is expected to continue, companies own words. Same CEO has been had the helm since day 1. CEO and top tier base strategy on acquisitions. This is has stopped working. Simply buying a product or company does not make the grade anymore you have to be able to align and execute. Cisco is in a free-fall in this respect.  From a Services perspective Cisco is missing the boat. The company has yet to figure out how to deliver on this. Then again so has its competitors."

Account manager,4.0,"Aug 6, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","Great benefits, VERY smart people to work with, can be very creative at times.

Long hours at times, very revenue focused."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Aug 14, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","Salary and benefits are decent, lots of great people.","The CEO claims to care about people but has turned the company into a splurge and purge, now managing by laying off people.  They used to at least go through the motions of trying to see if people's skill set would match any of the areas being actively invested in but the receiving VP's would almost always find something not up to par and go for a new hire instead.  In the last couple years they haven't even bothered with that, now they give people a few weeks to find something internally but usually cancel 98+% of the open reqs just before that to ensure they move most out of the company.  One of the reasons for this is that the management that matters is not allowed to do their job of actually managing their workforce.  They are always encouraged to manage out the bottom but more often than not they are not allowed to backfill those they manage out, which as you would expect, causes them to only manage out those that are a net negative to the team and not just a low performer.

We are trying to make innovation into a process, while continually adding more mandatory process that stifles innovation and all the while continually cutting budgets.

If you are not based in the SJ area or India the opportunity for advancement in the management hierarchy quickly declines as you rise in the ranks.

We claim to be have great success acquiring and integrating companies, and for as many as we've done you'd think that would be the case but don't believe the hype.  The only way it works if we are hands off."

It could be a great place to work if you happen to work in a group with growing business.,"Cisco used to like a startup company where engineers were empowered to make design and architecture decisions.

Customer support engineer iii,4.0,"Oct 16, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years","Lots of opportunity to find additional positions of interest within the company
* Stable workforce so long as you are not involved in a 'fringe' technology team being phased out
* Generous opportunity to find other positions if restructuring requires, and generous package in lieu of another position if you so choose","Slow to move into some newer technologies, though rapidly changing that attitude this past year
Yearly lay-offs are draining morale. Engineering is viewed as a cost center, so engineering is being marginalized by getting less of the bonus pot of money than some other areas in the corporation. We're not sure where this will lead Cisco in the future as it has traditionally been based on technology advancement. It might end up in very dark places for an engineer based in the USA.

The best benefits (restricted stock options, for example) are reserved for only the top 5 or 10% of employees. This is stratifying the environment, and a culture of severe envy is building. As an engineer, obtaining the top 5% can be counter intuitive. Technical excellence helps, but political connections are most important. This is anathema to a typical engineer.

As an engineer, the advancements of salary and title are now extremely limited. The upside to this is most of the engineers achieve excellent work-life balance since there is little benefit to working too hard.

All of the above started changing sharply in 2008. Before that, it was a very different story. Many engineers are mourning the loss of a once great Cisco."
Business operations manager,2.0,"Oct 23, 2014","Former employee, more than 8 years","Still has good hardware, and they are trying to change the culture.       Individually, some nice people with sharp skills but the company is like a large slug that can't move fast enough to get out its own tracks let alone the bullet train that is coming with software, cloud, and newer consumption models.","This company recently laid off thousands of people with more than half of the impacted employees over 50.    They shamelessly offer an extra 3 months of severance if the senior employee signs a non-disclosure and waiver of any rights for age bias.       The impacted employee is supposed to have the right to look within the company for an open req but that is window dressing.    No rehiring of the impacted people is allowed.     

Very few company perks  -- they aren't Google no matter how many interns they hire.      Not even bottled water is offered -- well for $1 a bottle.      

This company is headed for disaster unless their values and priorities don't change.      Their business processes and systems are archaic and even small business progressions like supporting the SP market with utilization billing is beyond their automation capabilities."

Huge opportunity for ""diverse"" people to have a strong career track.","Senior leadership that is focused on political consensus and not able to make good, practical decisions.
Leadership that puts their own individual careers ahead of their people and the company's success.  Managing up seems to be more important than doing the right thing, and what is sad is the people above the ""manage up"" folks can't seem to figure out that is what is happening; or they don't care.  It was pretty obvious to me when one of my direct report leaders was a manage up person that didn't take care of their team, and I had no place for that in my organization.
Cisco used to be mostly ""A"" players, and ""B"" players crept in.  ""A"" players as leaders hire more  ""A"" players and don't worry about the risk that the person they hired can supersede them.  ""B"" players hire ""C"" players so they can't be challenged.... and Cisco is well down that path now... even  worse are the many politically motivated  ""C"" players who have made their way into executive decision making roles.
Lost the early ""get things done, do the right thing, have fun"" Cisco culture as the company got big.
In early Cisco anybody could go see anybody with any title and have a conversation that often led to results.  Now you can't get on any executive calendar if they don't have a hidden agenda that involves you.
Diversity at Cisco means almost anything except older white males.  Unfortunately because the %s are so far off in the networking industry at large, good people are being sacrifice to the god of ""diversity""
Middle-aged white males have no future at Cisco, don't bother going there regardless of your experience, brilliance, leadership skill or innovation level.  If you are in that category and still there... change is good, look around."

+ Work/life balance is good. Rarely is anyone ever expected to work more than 40 hours per week. This might depend on your group though.

+ They are making a good effort to update their offices in San Jose from the old cubicle farms to the newer open-floor setups with free amenities (coffee/tea/espresso, snacks, etc.).

+ They do not skimp on developer machines and peripherals like monitors, headphones, etc.","- Very bureaucratic, lots of reorgs and movement at the middle and upper levels (e.g. new directors, mid-level managers, upper-level managers).

- The pay is below average in comparison to other tech companies in the Bay Area. Promotions/raises seem to be few and far between. It will soon be my third year here, and all of my developer peers have also complained about slow growth within the company.

- Due to the bureaucratic nature of the company, communication among the many groups is slow and sporadic.

- It may be different for other groups, but there seems to be a general lack of expertise when it comes to software development best practices:
-- Everything is hacked together
-- Quantity of features and speed of development > quality and stability
-- There are no design/architecture discussions that include all of the developers (""design"" of the product usually happens as informal conversations between mid-to-senior level developers, without including the newer/entry-level developers). These discussions are ad-hoc, informal, and often not even documented.
-- No standards followed for releases/deployment
-- Very little effort spent on documentation of anything
-- We are one of the many groups that tries to follow Agile/Scrum, but since we don't follow a lot technical practices that actual make Agile work (e.g. unit tests, code reviews, decent documentation, reasonably-sized & well-defined user stories, etc.), it isn't working as it should. The end result is shoddy code and constantly accumulating technical debt.

- People in non-technical roles (middle managers and product owners) push for features and user stories without really knowing what they want. User stories are often a terse title and an empty description (no behavioral/functional specifications, no summary, no consideration for inter-dependencies among other user stories).

- Projects often lack clear direction. This point applies to my group and our project, but I think it might apply to other groups as well. There are many technical leaders in our group, but for our project, we lack a TRUE lead technical architect who:

1) has a clear vision of what the product should be like
2) plans architecture & development tasks for the group
3) mentors less experienced developers
4) maintains standards on code quality and development processes

Bottom line: If you're looking for a place to hone your technical skills and grow as a developer, look elsewhere. Some of the other reviewers who mentioned a culture of complacency absolutely hit the nail on the head. I have observed first-hand many times where our group has accepted mediocre work or shortcuts without hesitation ""if it gets the job done,"" creating more technical debt. When developers ask for time to address technical debt, we are rebuffed by managers who claim that it is ""good enough"" and that we should focus on pumping out more features. If you stay here too long, your skills as a software developer will only continue to rust."

Customer support engineer iii,4.0,"Oct 26, 2020","Current employee, more than 5 years","PROS:
-- Positive Work environment / Corporate Culture.

-- Constant Exposure to New Technology.

-- Endless opportunities to develop existing skills, learn new skills on the job, and change roles.

-- Leadership is dedicated to making the company feel like one large ""team"" or ""family"" where everyone is there to help everyone else (not always practiced of course).

-- An extremely well organized and streamlined company.

-- Company culture heavily promotes internal-innovation and is very open to hearing about (and trying out) ideas of employees if they are innovative, reasonable, doable, and the employee is willing to make them a reality.

-- Technical ability and breadth of technical knowledge are prized commodities company-wide, even among non-technical roles, and often go hand-in-hand with opportunities for personal development and advancement.

-- Positive attitudes are well rewarded and those with a consistently negative outlook often find themselves a victim of the Annual ""limited restructuring"" events.

-- The annual layoffs do not usually impact technical workers (and their supporting coworkers) that are focused on growing / profitable technologies and products. 
-- In contrast to media speculation and Lamentations following layoffs on web forums, these layoffs are almost entirely avoidable. With the deluge of resources to learn new technologies and skills within Cisco, workers who find themselves layed off when their area of focus is no longer relevant (profitable) almost always passed up many opportunities to reskill, move into growing tech, etc. And the writing is always on the wall well before the axe falls. 

NOTE: there ARE exceptions to this like when huge portions of staff at one of the Cisco sites is let go for heartless business reasons -- such as when jobs are moved overseas to save money (or when jobs are moved back because customers prefer to ""speak to someone in ""). 

-- Cisco gives you a choice of several nice notebook models to use (including the current year MacBook Pro 15"") as well as quality monitors and computer peripherals for your daily use. This is a nice perk if you're a bit of a nerd, which many employees are.","CONS:
-- The (very) regular restructuring / layoff events. There really MUST be a less heartless and less disheartening way of aligning human resources with ever-changing corporate goals and fluctuations in stock prices. The current method of mass purges every year can't really be called anything other than lazy and uninspired leadership with a near-sighted view of success. For a company that so prizes innovation this practice sticks out like a sore thumb.

-- Oftentimes employees are dramatically underpaid for their work. Sadly, since many of these workers started with the company fresh out of college as interns, after 10+ years they will often find themselves making half of what an employee at another company with identical skills and experience makes. Since Cisco does not really ever give employees more than a few percent pay increase per year, many of these seasoned workers are trapped in a low paying position with no real hope of receiving a fair wage without leaving the company, accepting a (much) higher position at another company, and reapplying at Cisco a year or so later, at which point Cisco will match (or offer a slightly higher) wage than the worker is currently being paid. Situations like this really show that at the end of the day, a giant corporation that genuinely cares about its workers well-being, is still a giant corporation.

-- The Annual layoffs

-- Even when an employee is paid something close to fair market value for a specific role, the pay is typically lower than what the vast majority of other organizations will pay, and the benefits (once amazing beyond compare!) are very middle of the road. 

-- The annual layoffs

-- Unless a candidate is truly an industry leader or posseses unique skills Cisco cannot find elsewhere, there is no real room for negotiating pay / an employment contract. If the candidate attempts to negotiate after an offer has been made and rejects the initial offer, that's the end of the ball game. The hiring manager will go on down the list of the fifty other perfectly qualified candidates and offer the job to one of them. This regular practice has cost many candidates a job when they were simply following normal, acceptable job-seeker etiquette. The unstated (but commonly understood) idea behind this behaviour is that working for a great company like Cisco is a highly valuable reward in itself, and the difference in pay is accounting for that ""fact"" -- I have never heard of anyone telling this to a candidate but I have heard managers on a number of occasion allude to this.

-- The annual layoffs

-- The company was founded in Californis and has always been based in California. For those who do not know, this region of the US known is known for its very strong progressive and left-leaning social and political beliefs. And while almost always a good thing, the imprint the area in which Cisco is located oftentimes makes leadership announcements, company initiatives, etc. a little bit preachy and ""holier-than-thou"" -- looking down on those who do not always agree with Cisco's political or social stances on certain topics.

-- The annual layoffs. I am taking to YOU, CHUCK ROBBINS, please fix this for the sake of your loyal employees, you're so much better than this."
Sales manager,2.0,"Feb 9, 2021","Current employee, more than 3 years",Easy. Not very challenging.  Cisco is a place to join if you have 5 kids and you want minimal challenge.  Equal opportunity employer.  I get lovely emails from old executives who send out emails like “go team” and “let’s close the quarter strong” yet  I have no idea who these people are or what they do and I’m a manager!.  If I’m part of their team I would have loved to have met them! My sister is 54 with 3 kids and dreams of a job at Cisco so that says a lot.,Not very challenging. No real personal  growth potential...  Cisco worries more about what dividends they will give stock holders then how many shares they will give  talented employees.  I’m part of one of the large software companies that Cisco  acquired and the talent has fled like animals fleeing fire. I’ve personally stayed because of growth opportunities exist but hiring new talent under Cisco is almost impossible.  Because Cisco came from the hardware world they do not fully understand the software world.  the concept of retaining talent or talent acquisition is not really understood.  When COVID happened Cisco stopped all hiring for 4 or 5 months while every other smart company in the world gobbled up our talent.  If you look at Cisco’s leaders it’s like viewing a sad picture gallery of a high school reunion from 1950 ...  some will see this as a joke but it’s really a view into the slow death of what once was a champion.  Cisco can only find washed up 50 year olds for executives? I’m not against age but I know more people in their 30s who are better leaders then Cisco’s geriatric crowd.  I’ve been to many large marketing trade show events where large companies like google or other companies similar to cisco are there with huge flashy creative booths telling you a million ways how they will solve your problems.  Then you come to the Cisco booth and it says just “Cisco” ... as if someone in marketing thought that was enough to explain what they do ... very sad

They will find fault in you even though the process might be set up before your time, you will be blamed. 

In front of you, will tell you if you need help look for them, they are here to make you successful. But at your back, say bad things about you."
Technical solutions architect,4.0,"Jan 28, 2022","Former employee, more than 5 years","Cisco pays well, bonuses for performance, unless you really knock it out of the park, and makes an effort to manage its employees effectively.

Cisco is confronting a new and rapidly evolving business as they try to transform to a software driven business. Employees with those skills are going to find Cisco a great short term opportunity. Then the politics step in.","Most of your managers will turn over in a year or two. It takes longer for the least competent to be replaced however.

The world is becoming software. Cisco is hugely dependent on Software, but their business models emphasize hardware. Consequently, their ability to execute to the rapid pace in the software world is challenged. This hurts your ability to fully maximize sales programs and leaves technical people in a support quagmire. 

Cisco is not a place for the long term. During my tenure my entire office of ""Gray Lizards"", people with decades of experience, customer relationships and technical knowledge of the quirks of older systems and how to keep them going, was riffed and we got a 42 page memo showing that in addition to those of us over 50, they had also removed several people who were 30 and thus no ageism existed in their decisions. While hard to accept, I do appreciate that times are changing for Cisco and they need to change with them.

Mid-Level ""Faces"" of the company change annually - indicating that priorities and investments are changing as well. Does not bode well for longer term employment stability after 2-3 years, especially if you are a project manager.

As with any company, politics is rife the higher you go. But at Cisco, the impact of politics is felt at operational levels in terms of investments, timelines rewards, and constraints. Duplicity is very common around projects that once held great promise, but now have new people with new priorities in place."
Network consulting engineer,4.0,"Jun 27, 2022","Former employee, more than 3 years","Best for work life balance. Some teams have less than 2 or 3 hours of work a day. I myself had just about 6 hours of work a week for a good period of time after I automated a few of my tasks (not possible in TAC teams though).
Job security even during layoffs (India only)
You get a chance to learn new technologies, internal movement etc. Can grow skills during the downtime since work doesnt usually take up too much time. 
Company is very employee centric, you will get time off, benefits and support. Eg. Company went above and beyond during Covid crisis giving all employees in India 50k as a one time bonus irrespective of grade. They also helped with medical care and expenses in many cases. The Cisco India community is very kind and supportive (helped arrange beds and oxygen etc).
Feels amazing to be working at a place where you can learn a lot. The resources we have at our disposal to skill up is amazing - especially for those in networking domain. Just dont stay in boring roles like BCS and move to better teams.","Use the free time wisely. A lot of people get stagnant and lose skills due to ample free time and not skilling up. Cisco does not have good growth in terms of pay. If you get stuck with boring work, change teams.
The pay disparity is huge. Over 50% pay difference in many cases between people in same roles with same skills. Pay seems to be more about experience than skills - something that resembles a government company (could be a good thing for many since there is job security). 
The TAC teams are especially bleeding talent due to terrible pay that has not kept up with industry. Freshers make more money than skilled, experienced folks who tend to leave to competitors. This has resulted in terrible support experience for customers. Most TAC cases globally are handled by folks with less product experience from Bangalore since the senior folks leave for better pay. 
Some teams are better placed in terms of decision making, benefits, product trainings etc than others. This disparity is often seen in different ways eg. Bangalore folks end up doing back office work and dont lead engagements or interact directly with customer.
Consulting roles which are NOT TAC are amazing for experienced folks looking for relaxation and retirement only and really atrophy the skills of freshers who want to grow and learn.
Do not stay if you want a pay bump. Internal growth is measly and the metrics used to evaluate performance are often gamed. Best to skill up and jump ship."
Security sales specialist,5.0,"Oct 12, 2022",Current employee,"Great benefits, the people that work here are friendly and helpful, if you do your job right you can be rewarded with some healthy commission checks regularly",Sometimes your success depends on the territory that you're given and the team that you work with in each territory.

I am hoping they fix that sooner than later.

The cafeterias are very nice, and they have an excellent gym in building 6. Overall, the benefits package is great. Top management seemed mostly honest, and middle management is less venal than other companies I have worked at. Cisco is very driven by their ""VSE"" documents (Vision, Strategy, Execution) and takes them very seriously - I found it refreshing to find a company that actually does take Vision and Strategy seriously. They actually measure things, and sometimes make decisions based on those measurements - an idea from an underling with good data can overturn the intent of a VP with an opinion, sometimes.","They will try to work you to death. Some parts of the company are a lot sharper than others - I was part of a group that was closely aligned to another group, and I was always amazed at how much more organized the other group seemed; we just couldn't seem to make decisions and stick to them. Middle managers (directors) seem so busy with all kinds of activities that they don't seem to have any time to manage. All managers are expected to have ""individual contributor"" duties, which diminish their effectiveness as managers. Cisco loves routine, procedure, and process; it is very difficult to do anything new there."
Manager,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Former employee,Cisco does a lot of good for the community.  They take pride in giving back and are taking large steps to becoming more green.  John Chambers is a solid guy and does a lot for the employees and the community.  Cisco provides excellent benefits and compensation is competitive.  The company is so large that there are limitless opportunities if you are positioned well to take advantage of them.  Being global offers limitless opportunity for travel and international exposure. Cisco is also a very flexible company to work for.  They have onsite day care and allow most people to work remote.,"Cisco is extremely political.  As with any large company it depends on the group but I have seen very dark/bad behavior from executives at the SVP level on down.  The lengths people will go to at Cisco to remain in power are drastic and ugly.  There is definately a good old boys network and mostly the unsavory survive.  I left because I could not trust senior management.  There are not many leaders there that truly care about there people.  Most are very savvy at managing up and leave a lot to be desired about managing down.  I would not reccomend Cisco, despite all of their good qualities because I felt like it was a cultural cess pool."
Software engineer iii,2.0,"Aug 10, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is a great place to balance work and everyday life or your side interests. Working from home is accepted, you can take a long lunch break and disappear for a few hours, nobody will notice. There is plenty of vacation and salary is decent compared to the work you are required to do. It's a big name in the networking business and if you are smart enough you can learn a lot. There are plenty of opportunities to learn with online and real classes.","The level and quality of engineering is overall pretty low, lower than many other companies: many people still use the same tools as they used  30 years ago. Other are jealous of what they know and try not to share it with anybody (job security?!?). Process is very very long and frustrating: with 60k employees, it sometimes takes a week to do a 1 hour job. It all explain why many products are coming from acquisitions and are not developed internally. 
There is no diversity at all in engineering: I would guess 90% is from India (maybe more).
Also, from the level of director going up, many are ""retired"": they are just interested in getting their bonus and consider sending random emails at random hours (with their blackberry and similar) a valid proof that they are working around the clock.

There are not many chances to improve your career once you get on board in term of salary or promotion: i.e., negotiate well before signing or you might just get stuck with something that you really do not like. Also, watch out on where you end up going: you might be forced to just do fire fighting and bug fixing and no development (almost at all): that's not good in your resume and it's not good for your mind."

Great education opportunity, many internal courses that employee can sign up.  Overall administration supports are pretty good.  Some locations, the departments had the freedom to design the office layout and worked very nice.  Work from home or remote are supported by some managements, not all, and the company has great technology to make that fairly easy to do.  Used to be, cisco provided all kinds of drinks to employee.  But that had been removed in recent years to save the cost.","Cisco moves a lot jobs from US to off-shore, ie. India and China.  It is very common that on one day, the company cut hundreds of jobs from US, and the next day it opens hundreds of job in Inida.  The upper management only believe the short term profit and does not value the employee's experiences and quality.  They only look the numbers and thinking more number of engineers is sufficient to cover the lost of experienced people.  The quality of the products get worse and worse.  Many people got frustrated and decided to leave the co.  The first line management has poor skills to manage engineers.  Many promotions are just the result of networking.  Cisco also hiring a lot contractors from India with working visa for US positions.  That was the results of influences from contract houses running by India owners.  I didn't know how much under the table deals they had with Cisco management.

- ESPP is a good deal
- Decent direct managers if you have one in the US
- Payment for oncall time worked
- For the most part, no micromanagement - you can do your job how you see fit, as long as you stay within the processes set by other departments.","- Company is losing full time employees rather quickly. The good employees are leaving to take better offers, and the bad ones are sticking around. Most people I know who left were offered 20% more to work elsewhere.
- Lost positions are typically not being backfilled. My manager is in India while I am in the US because my former US manager took a better offer. I have no visibility with my current manager because of this, which will greatly stunt my career growth. There are no plans to have a US manager.
- Most positions that are actually being backfilled are contractor positions. Contractors don't care about the company and it shows in their work. By the time they're ramped up and useful, they leave for a better offer. 
- Poor work-life balance. Even though they try to promote it, the ridiculous processes that require tons of weekend work prevent it in practice. This company is run on silly processes and meetings run by PMs who like to feel important. 
- Company is taking our cubicles away and putting us into bullpens (CCW). No personal workspace, it's very noisy and just a very terrible working environment. We had no choice in the matter, it was forced upon us. Management tried to make it seem positive by saying that everyone loves it. Nobody likes it except for the implementers. 
- Recognition is very poor outside of what your manager recognizes you for in front of your team. Your director and above probably has no idea who you are, nor do they seem to care. Promotions  in the form of raises are very rare, so after you've worked here for a few years, you're making less than when you started due to inflation. Most people move laterally instead. 
- Budget cuts are bordering ridiculous. No training budget makes personal and technical development nearly impossible. No travel makes it so you spend hours working with people you've never met and can't attend conferences. 
- Cisco is not innovating. They acquire garbage that other companies have already beat us to. The number of business processes stifles product development, so that we're almost the last ones to release a product. Customers have found us difficult to work with as a result of these processes."

- Too many levels of management, product specialists and useless positions... people are working constantly to justify their positions.  
- No employee loyalty... the only concern is the bottom line.  Direct management will stalk you for hour to hour business updates offering to do anything they can do to help, ultimately doing nothing but adding unnecessary stress and day to day headache with endless spreadsheets and busy work, greatly limiting time to sell.
- Amazing number of managers with no direct reports dreaming up activities to justify their own existence.
- Internal processes are painful to navigate.
- Forecasting is a complete farce... reps are highly encouraged to commit business that does not exist in order to forecast to team quota and when you don't meet those numbers the same managers will set you up internally as delivering consistently bad forecasting and use it as ammunition against you.
- Accounts and quotas assigned by favoritism and if you're new, prepare for a well picked over list.  
- Highly political environment... unless you're in with the political clicks and completely inhaling their Kool-Aid, you should always be concerned for your job status.    
- Lots of great people, sales reps and upper management but...
- Middle management (RM) regional sales management need to be reigned in, sweat shop mentality and the ability to make your life hell to the point of complete harassment and use of bullying tactics.  Ego trips way beyond anything I've ever seen.  Obviously not true for all RM's but...

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Oct 1, 2019","Current employee, more than 1 year","At the level of policies(leave, compensation, benefits, bonus) this is one of the best companies to work for.","Engineers in India are treated as second class citizens by some managers. If the manager doesn't feel comfortable with you(for some reason that he alone knows) and would like to exclude you he will play with your weaknesses rather than with your strengths. 
This is how its done. Its bit tricky but neatly done. Have patience to read.
'Certain people' will be allowed to work on technologies they already know of (at least to certain extent). Those 'certain people' will be given a good edge on the product knowledge, exposure to other teams, technical discussions, requirements etc., 'Other guys'(the second class citizens) will be given tasks on the technologies that they do not know.  The timeline will also be short and the requirements will not be detailed enough.  The 'Other guys' will need to go behind the 'Certain people' for the details. This will be like you're in mid of a dark forest.
No one will ask whether you know the technology or not.  Nobody will care whether you're interested to work on that or not. You'll simply be forced to do that. In a nutshell you'll be given work in a technology that you do not know, requirements that are not detailed enough and in a short timeline. If you're unable to do this that will be considered as a weakness and will be taken as a good reason for not giving you opportunity to work on technologies that you already know of, interested in and in which you've already proved your skills. The funny part is that the manager himself will not know the technology but he will stamp others who do not know the technology as weak guys and exclude them.
Even when you express your areas of interest that will not be considered as 'Certain people' are already working on that. This double standard is so worse that if nobody in 'Certain people' available to do a work in a technology known to 'Other guys', it will be done even by some other team but never be given to 'Other guys' who belong to the same team. 
Ultimately, what manager wants out of you is the demotivation and he'll get that eventually. The 'Other guys' must work on the spill over work of the 'Certain people'. Thats what ultimately needed.
I certainly don't understand why they recruit engineers in India and try so much hard to exclude them and deliver a crystal clear message that you are not here to do a job that you like to do. Your passion and interests doesn't matter. 
Moreover, false promises on opportunities will be given by the manager on some holiday trip which he forgets as soon as he leaves the city. So, do not trust the promises. The faith will go in vain for sure.
In a nutshell, do better research on the team you're joining. Otherwise, you may regret it and leave soon."

To have a direct hand in the hardware, software, and business processes that Cisco provides for its customers, knowing the impact you're having, is extremely satisfying.  Other great reasons to work for Cisco is the location.  Cisco's campus is right in the heart of Silicon Valley, where business and technology expands at the speed of human involvement and communication.  To opportunities are great for those who are ready for them.","There are very few downsides of working at Cisco Systems.  One particular downside is the very large scale of Cisco's business.  Communication between different business units, and venturing through Cisco's intranet can sometimes be challenging.  However, with increased knowledge of the different services available on the intranet, as well as constructing a vast network of colleges within Cisco will make navigating the intranet as well as navigating the Org charts much more manageable.  One further downside to Cisco, particularly in San Jose, is the immense cost of living.  Once you get over the initial price tag shock, you'll be just fine.  Plus Cisco helps to compensate for the cost of living with your salary."

It analyst,4.0,"Nov 12, 2009",Former employee,"I worked there as an intern, and thought it was a great place to spend an internship. Cisco has a really laid back, west coast culture, especially the IT group. My manager always listened to our concerns and was understanding about time off and working from home. Overall, a good experience.","Larger Organization means it's harder to maneuver within the group. I've not experienced this yet, but thats what i've heard. Also, the HR is super disorganized.

Management even listens to suggestions, and recently starting giving people their birthday off, company-wide!
-There's some pretty neat projects to work on. It's always good working with relevant technologies and picking up skills that are valuable even on other projects and at other companies. I'd argue this is one of the most important aspects of a tech job.
-Cisco is pretty good about recognizing achievements. If you do a really good job, Cisco will recognize you with some award, almost always accompanied by some cash and a goofy but appreciated certificate or plaque or trophy.
-Pretty decent opportunities to move up and get raises. I've only been here a short while, but they do give modest annual raises, and I know people who get promotions every so often.","-A lot of the tooling is out of the stone age. It's extremely frustrating when you're trying to build the hot new thing, and you're constrained by tools and systems that have been obsolete for over a decade. In some areas we're using the hottest new things (docker, Jenkins, artifactory, VMware, etc.), and in other areas we're using systems from the 90s (CVS, SVN, a homemade bug tracking system, decade-plus old poorly written perl scripts, etc.)

Human resources manager,5.0,"Feb 1, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","Cisco is capturing the transition of the changing work place and workforce.  Never in my career have I been a part of a company that has been able to capture the market transition with a view and ability to translate the change and impact on everyday work for employees.  The concept of digitization and automation is real.  I am watching groups like Supply Chain and HR open the gates to their employees to rethink how work is done.  They are not asking people managers or senior leaders to do this - they are asking employees.  The are looking at full day experiences to break old processes and use new tools to re-invent work. We are telling Cisco how to work differently, using the tools and best practices that we see.  We will learn together.  We get to take simplification and speed to another level.  Every demographic in the workplace can join in to reboot work.  In this digital world the walls must come down, employees must work together to solve problems, motivate each other and bring in the talent to continue the wave.  It is real - Cisco is doing it!  We are connecting everything, benefiting everyone and innovating everywhere!  The culture at Cisco is evolving...Human Resources is standing up in a bold way to be a driving force in how the company evolves.  We all have to step into the conversation and be a part of this change.  Relationships still matter but you also have to think differently - real time.  Nothing remains the same....this is fantastic.","In order to be a part of the transition, you have to have time to think and solve the problems in a new way.  We work hard and smart.  In this time of change - you must do more.  Work life integration is getting harder.  So remember wherever you are,  you must take time to reflect and rest,  or you will not be able to see the changes you must make."
Technical leader,5.0,"Apr 19, 2016","Current employee, more than 1 year","I was always afraid of joining a behemoth of a company: afraid to lose my creativity and individuality. Of course, you're a small fish in a large ocean at Cisco, but I've come to realize/understand that everything (your enjoyment, focus, motivation, loyalty, and on and on) hinges directly on the business unit (BU) and managing chain you're brought into. I was extremely fortunate to have landed in an up-and-coming BU that is constantly heralded as a ""do not fail"" BU which really keeps you positive. If anything, do your homework and talk to multiple people that work directly in or with your team under the same direct chain of management and pray you'll not be working under an old-school type that refuses to learn new technologies and practices. Some of those guys refuse to accept that it's 2016 and the world has moved on :) Below are some things I find great about working here (keeping in mind both my manager and director are wicked smart and easy-going if you're a hard worker and can prove you're a solid engineer):

* a fantastic work from home policy - I refuse to uproot my family and slog it out in CA where home prices are 4-5x more, so I get an income that basically no other local company can match in overall compensation without moving more into the senior manager/VP positions
* benefits are great - my family uses the high deductible plan which works well for us if you can build up enough buffer in your HSA and take advantage of the hundreds of dollars of HSA  incentives; paid life insurance; paid short- and long-term disability
* structured bonus plan - the bonus is nothing to laugh at and is extremely welcome; it's tied to both your performance (kind of derived by your manager) and the companies metrics (customer service quality, shareholders, revenue, etc) but if both do well your percentage goes up
* 4.5% match, immediately vested, 401k-roth option, brokerage option, bonus matching, bonus stock (4-year vesting)
* BU-dependent, but budget for training, conferences, books, classes, etc are all very good if you choose to use them
* perks galore - I guess I didn't realize that with thousands of employees comes greater purchasing power, so various discounts on anything from Whirlpool appliances and movie tickets, to reduced cell phone bills and (I kid you not) solar panel installs. You may not use all of what's available or even care, but to even provide so many different ways to save you cash on things you're going to buy will lead to more compensation
* the career path and income increases in all former jobs has been engineer, senior engineer, (maybe principal), manager, glass ceiling...then what? More management? At Cisco they have two paths: management and engineering. The roles and responsibilities increase as you go up levels in either of those paths, as well as the pay and perks, however, they understand that good engineers may want to remain engineers, and they reward their great ones accordingly. I think this is in my top 3.","* Kind of an ongoing reorganization (aka, forced layoffs) discussion that seems to have been a strong theme the last few years, but nothing really negative as happened yet. I believe there's a severance package if this does happen to you?
* Like many places, your peers could be complete duds, which forces you to pick up their slack or else the entire team including yourself look terrible...but, without any ""real"" guidelines in place to let these people go they kind of hang around and leach off the company and their peers
* I've been here over a year and through various conversations with my peers I've discovered that I should probably be a level above where I'm at now, however it is not really clear at all how you move up"

Virtual customer success manager-csap,5.0,"Sep 18, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year","This is a great sales training rotational program for people with sales experience who want to first learn about and understand the Customer Success role. Cisco in general is an amazing company to work for and our leaders are just that; intelligent, committed, individuals who strive to ensure our success.

Customer Success is the new era of sales and I would highly reccomend this position. This role is unique in how it exposes you to the new way of not just selling products, but selling business outcomes. It's also exciting for those who like to innovate, value relationship-building with the customer, and pioneer new processes and ideas. I really enjoy being able to have direct impact at a company this big and being a member of the Customer Success Team here at Cisco gives you that unique opportunity. 

I can't emphasize enough the responsiveness of our executives and leaders; I'm honestly amazed at how Cisco has given new employees the ability to have exposure with our senior management and how willing and compasionate they are about our sales team.

I would reccomend Cisco, Customer Success, and Sales to anyone, hands down.","Working at a fortune 100 company as large as Cisco, especially as we migrate our revenue model and product offerings, means there will be holes. I think this is natural at any large company but the mindset of adapting to ever-changing processes, acquisitions, etc. is crucial in order to thrive. Not necessarily a con if you like a challenge and put in a lot of effort. 

No ""work from home"" but not necessarily a con either; I personally prefer to come in the office but just something to keep in mind as people have different views on this."
It business analyst,5.0,"Oct 10, 2017","Current employee, more than 3 years","I started working at Cisco immediately after graduating college. I was placed in operations and was able to learn some valuable generic business skills. Although the role wasn't necessarily a good long term fit for me, I was able to find a new job within Cisco IT after about 2 weeks of looking for something new. This new role has been amazing! I have a manager who is flexible with my work hours, coworkers who are fun and hard-working, and work that makes me feel fulfilled. Every time I talk to my family about my job and work/life balance, they are amazed and advise I stay at Cisco for as long as I can. I believe I am paid well for my status of early in career and I am learning a lot of skills that will be beneficial in whichever line of work I do. Management is great and I feel that out of the three managers I've had, each one of them were attentive to my personal and career growth. 

I have not had any experience at other corporate workplaces, but I know that I have fallen in love with the culture of Cisco. I feel as if this is a safe place with no judgments, people who care about you, and provides an open work environment. Definitely a great place to work and I highly recommend!","Cisco is a large company and therefore, it can sometimes take a while to get things done due to red tape. I personally have not encountered this problem yet but have heard stories. 

Even though I am lucky to be on a team with an average age of about 26, many people who work at Cisco are a little older (or wiser). As an early and career worker, it can sometimes be difficult to relate to those who are 20+ years older than I am but that doesn't mean they are any less nice."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Nov 9, 2017",Current employee,"Joining as a graduate and having been part of other graduate roles with other companies that I won't name, Cisco really devotes a lot of time to training and developing their employees. The interview process did not accurately reflect the culture that lies within Cisco, one that truely cares and provides meaningful work.

As someone who struggled with the quarter life crisis, wondering if a terrible 9-5 job for the rest of my life in 'mundane corporate' doing pretty much nothing but pretending to look busy whilst shuffling numbers on spreadsheets or doing meaningless presentations no one cares about, Cisco definitely changed my perspective on corporate life.

The work is meaningful, it gives me purpose, and whilst it is challenging, you are adequately rewarded and then some. The people are excellent and if you are passionate about technology, this is the place to be. A moral and ethical company, I strongly feel that Cisco is a great place to work. I highly recommend to anyone who were overachievers in high school and university who feel like their talent is wasted at other companies to apply to Cisco as they will push you to your best.","There is some cons to mention however. Again and again, I keep seeing people who are toxic to the organisation promoted. Positive encouragement and a flexible culture should be fostered and those that promote this culture of pushing boundaries, thinking outside the box, creativity, and making decisions with a bit of gut should be moved forward. Those who hold a traditional view of the office, making every i is dotted and every t is crossed, with their archaic ways and no value add to the company should be kept in positions where they have no influence over the culture or better, removed."
