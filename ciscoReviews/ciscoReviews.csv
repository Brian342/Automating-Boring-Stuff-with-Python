"Manager, network services",4.0,"Mar 13, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","I decided to wait almost a year after leaving the company before posting a review.  The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.

The company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.","Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.

If you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.

While Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."
Systems engineer,3.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years","Overall, Cisco is a good place to work. As a senior systems engineer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with many thoughtful, capable, and genuine people across teams—from engineering and test to compliance, product management, executives, manufacturing, and TAC. The company encourages technical excellence, and there are pockets of genuinely supportive leadership. That said, the experience can vary dramatically depending on your org and manager, and some managers operate with impunity despite repeated and serious concerns.","If you end up with a manager who manipulates systems and relationships—undermining direct reports, peers, and even superiors to secure promotion or survival—the only real option is to leave. Don’t expect HR, ER, or internal processes to intervene meaningfully, even when misconduct is extensively documented and corroborated by multiple witnesses. This toxic behavior often goes unpunished and actively rewarded—with visibility, advancement, incentives, and plenty of opportunities to retaliate against those who speak up.

Cisco has trimmed HR/ER and internal enforcement functions so much that the cultural messaging from the Cisco People Office feels performative and aspirational rather than reflective of ground-level realities."
Strategy & planning,4.0,"Jul 8, 2025",Former employee,"Grow and learn with some genuinely smart and capable folks
Prestige of working for the market leader
Stays innovative through some great external acquisitions
Good internal tools and work resources
Overall a supportive company culture","The 'old guard' of Cisco can be quite bureaucratic and political. You will discover that more innovative/more approachable/results driven leadership comes in from external acquisitions rather than long time senior employees.

After a certain point, growth heavily hinges on somebody senior 'sponsoring' you. Ergo, high performance on its own will not open doors at the upper middle to senior manager level.

It's a big company (~80K employees). Things can get lost."
Human resources,3.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years",People are collaborative. Nice culture.,Frequency of lay-offs are destabilizing
Solutions engineer,4.0,"Aug 10, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",Great culture for the most part. I know it mainly depends on your team but most leaders aren’t terrible.,It sense like the powers that be don’t understand advertising and public sentiment
Program manager,1.0,"May 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","As a Programme Manager at Cisco, my role involved school visits and leading the LittleBigAwards campaign.","I made the difficult decision to leave Cisco because I wanted to work in an environment where accessibility, inclusion, and opportunities for growth were prioritised. While I appreciated many aspects of the company, the lack of true disability inclusion and the ongoing uncertainty from constant reorganisations pushed me to seek a more supportive and empowering workplace."
Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Cisco offers a truly flexible hybrid work environment, which makes it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance. The team I work with is incredibly supportive, collaborative, and open to new ideas. The culture promotes learning, growth, and inclusion. Leadership is approachable and transparent. Overall, it's a positive and empowering place to work.",None so far – I've had a great experience.

Data scientist,2.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Chill work life balance and long paternity leave if you need it.,"I felt it was a cost cutting place. 
Did not even have company sponsored team dinners and no one knows which direction to work on. Sort of like a ruder less ship.
It did not feel like a top IT place. It had a lot of very average people most of whom had only masters from only a few select colleges i.e. the ones that the seniors belonged to. Low level of tech expertise is needed and most higher level people didn't understand much advanced ML stuff. Much higher importance was given to visibility than actual innovation and being managers pet will take you a long way."

Product sales specialist,2.0,"May 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years",None. Hope it could be better.,"The decision-making style within this historic IT company often reminds me of the unpredictability seen in broad policy shifts like the Trump-era tariffs — top-down directives issued without adequate consideration for on-the-ground realities. In some cases, organizational restructures have been implemented without fully understanding product segmentation, technical distinctions, or how various solutions align with customer needs. This has led to inefficiencies and friction among teams.

There’s also a noticeable tendency toward rigid, hierarchical leadership — occasionally influenced by a militaristic mindset — which can stifle open communication and discourage constructive feedback. When leadership becomes overly dominant or insulated, particularly at the regional level, it hampers effective decision-making and fosters an unhealthy work environment.

Moreover, the company’s global alignment remains inconsistent. Reporting lines still vary by country, and unequal treatment of product-side teams by account-side stakeholders reflects broader issues in organizational equity. These structural imbalances need to be addressed to create a truly collaborative and fair working culture."

Engineering leader,5.0,"May 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","I honestly can't speak highly enough about my experience at Cisco. From day one, it's been clear that this is a company that genuinely prioritizes its employees.

The Work-Life Balance (WLB) is truly outstanding – it's not just a buzzword here, it's deeply ingrained in the culture. Leadership actively encourages you to disconnect, take time off, and manage your schedule flexibly. Whether it's managing family commitments, personal appointments, or just needing time to recharge, Cisco provides the flexibility and support to ensure work seamlessly integrates into your life, rather than dominating it. Burnout is not a factor here; instead, there's a strong emphasis on sustainable productivity and employee well-being.

Compensation and Benefits are also exceptionally good. The pay is highly competitive, reflecting the value employees bring. Beyond a great base salary, the comprehensive benefits package (health, 401k match, generous PTO, and potential for bonuses/RSUs) is fantastic. I feel truly valued and fairly compensated for my contributions.

Beyond these two major points, the culture is incredibly collaborative and supportive. You're surrounded by brilliant, kind, and approachable colleagues. There are ample opportunities for learning and growth, whether through internal programs, mentorship, or working on cutting-edge projects. Cisco's commitment to innovation and social impact (diversity, sustainability) also makes it a truly rewarding place to work. It's a company where you can feel proud of what you're contributing to.""","Honestly, it's genuinely challenging to pinpoint any significant 'cons' that detract from the overwhelmingly positive experience at Cisco. My experience here has consistently exceeded expectations. If I had to stretch to identify a 'con,' perhaps the sheer size of the organization means navigating certain internal processes can sometimes take a moment, but teams are always helpful and resources are abundant. This is a truly minor point within a sea of positives."

The people in Cisco are mostly exceptional to work with and a highlight of working there.","Some roles became overwhelming as each year you were expected to do more with less resources.  Key sales resources would be taken away or there'd be hiring freezes and you'd have to pick up the slack and were expected to overachieve on your sales goal.  Cisco could do a better job making information about employee development programs known as they have various programs, but sometimes you just find out randomly through word of mouth. Even if someone needs to be nominated for a program, the employees should know they exist."

- Exposure to a wide range of IT and cybersecurity products. Free certifications & courses that are recognised worldwide.
- You’ll learn a lot—mostly because you’re forced to wear multiple hats.
- Lots of GREAT colleagues who try to support each other under pressure. They're some of the nicest workmates you'll ever end up working with.","- After the mass layoff, workloads doubled, but salaries stayed the same. Management’s answer: ""budget constraints."" Nothing changes - well, not in your favour anyways. But policy and workload changes? A lot.
- You're expected to do more than what you were officially hired for - lead generation, qualification, technical guidance, account creation, and pseudo-account management—but you're still treated and paid like a basic lead qualifier. Commissions are even capped. Imagine closing a deal more than 600k in a single week, but your commission didn't even reflect 1% of that achievement. Instead, rewards are given in the form of cash vouchers or gift cards.
- That being said; no career growth & no clear progression from management. Lots of GREAT people have left just because you're so busy focusing on the wrong things. You're punishing TOP achievers just because they don't follow your note-keeping style?? ridiculous.
- Recognition is scarce. You keep the engine running, but it feels like you’re invisible unless something goes wrong. Each quarterly meeting is spent on celebrating wins that didn't even reflect back to the team members' contribution.
- ""Work-life balance"" is for other teams & upper management. For the rest of us, it's 5 days in the office & you can only make calls at your own desk, not in any of the designated quiet room. Reason being: they want to SEE & HEAR you make the calls. As if we don't use recording tools. Micromanagement at its peak.
- Leadership is disconnected from day-to-day struggles. Feedback feels like it goes into a black hole. Pointless. Weekly check ins? Useless."

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 7, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Amazing Cisco culture and growth opportunities, best globally. 
Super learning opportunities and great technologies","CCBU is generally a great place to work, but unfortunately, a few handful unfit so called managers have severely impacted the environment. In some teams, the toxicity is particularly rampant, and it goes unchecked because two individuals are enabling unethical behavior , and its unchecked totally, as developers fear their job , as they will threathen them with dire consequences.

Person KK, who is abusive and egotistical, constantly demands respect, claiming to be the key to the team’s success while threatening others with consequences, if he is not respected. Person NS, a close friend of K's wife, that everyone must support him, and blindly will follow him, technically NS himself will not know anything.

In this dysfunctional environment, any task that doesn't get done is automatically attributed by a threat to talk to KK. The team works tirelessly, yet NS takes all the credit, while KK rewards him for it and never the team. If you don’t meet expectations, NS will relentlessly contact you—calling, texting, and reach out non stop on whats-app and even reaching out to your family, all while disregarding any personal boundaries. 

N's only role seems to be demanding ETAs with no planning or structure, undermining Cisco’s otherwise amazing culture.

This stressful environemnt persists only because both K and N protect each other’s interests. I was ill and I could not even get up, my father was contacted on phone as to where is your son and while I was sick with a high fever. The mental stress I endured is ongoing as only one person listens who is in USA, and he is unaware of these folks. As a developer I am not able to work on new technologies and upcomign features and techstack.
Thats how talent dies.
My peers in Vendor company were tortured mentally even in pregnancy.

Cisco is a wonderful company, but this one team under Kk and N’s so called titled leadership is a glaring exception."

"Leaders in finance and technology (lift), financial analyst",2.0,"Nov 15, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","I completed Cisco's LIFT Program and was initially excited by its strong reputation in the Cisco community. The program was once an esteemed and highly respected path for early-career development, but unfortunately, things have gone downhill under the current management.","Leadership has been particularly problematic. He is difficult to work with, and I personally observed a sexist bias within the program. It was clear that male participants were promoted more frequently than women, which was a shared concern among my graduating class.

The program consists of four rotations and four LIFT academies. While these academies are meant to support development, in practice, they lack fairness. Assessments are inconsistent, and favoritism is common. Performance doesn’t always seem to matter. For instance, the “top performer” in my group was actually absent on vacation for a large part of the timeline, and despite multiple complaints about their performance, program management ignored these concerns and selected that person as the only one from our group to receive LIFT honors.

The current class is regarded as having a poor attitude, often logging in after 11 a.m. and frequently complaining. 

Overall, if you're one of Tim’s favorites, you may have a smoother path, but if not, expect to face politics rather than professional growth. The LIFT Program needs strong, unbiased leadership to restore its reputation and value."

+ salary (around 110% of the average)
+ occasional trips to the office (once every 5-6 months) fully paid by the company","+ Individual performance (your customers' satisfaction and review etc.) is overshadowed by your reputation. It takes one person's negative opinion about you to lose a big portion of a pay rise. In other words, you need to behave like the company wants you to behave. This is why criticism is not welcomed in practice.
+ little to no opportunities in some departments and locations, Poland especially
+ a lot of bureocracy
+ work flexibility (schedule/calendar) is getting lower with each year. I.e. In theory you can move lunch slots to other hour, but in reality the system does not allow for that as there is not enough staff at almost every hour of the day."

I have been here almost 10 years and it was the company I planned to retire with, but with all the recent change people are silently quitting. There is still alot of good going on but it gets harder to see it when there is so much negative impact and people are so unhappy.","The company has changed the compensation model so many times over the last few years I can't even count - There is no budget to travel. I run a sales team that supports America and literally am given 1,500/ quarter for each seller to support their customers in person. This is a joke and it has been going on for 4 quarters. Also the compensation model for all sellers is terrible. Cisco pays a decelerated amount until sellers hit 50% of their number then from 50-75% a slight accelerated number to make up for the decelerator - then paid out at 100% once seller hits 75%. This is terrible especially for GES and public sector sellers who many times pull in 30-50% of their revenue in Q4. Not to mention we have lay off's constantly and 0 stability at the SLT level .

Flexible working arrangements.
Average benefits.","Cisco has become an extremely unstable company. Every year I worked there, there were layoffs, and now layoffs have become a regular occurrence. In my last year alone, there were three rounds of layoffs, which clearly indicates that management lacks direction. Instead of implementing a strong long-term strategy, leadership continuously resorts to downsizing, showing a complete lack of vision for the company's future.

Additionally, many management and director-level roles are assigned to individuals with little to no relevant experience. This leads to poor decision-making and a lack of leadership. Collaboration between teams is nearly nonexistent, with constant conflicts between the so-called global teams and regional teams. The work environment is toxic, and promotions are not based on hard work or expertise but rather on internal connections and favoritism.

Salaries are below industry average, and salary increases are rare. If you're expecting regular raises, good luck—because they barely happen. Any employee benefits or initiatives seem to be purely for show rather than genuine care for employees. One glaring example was when the company was publicly celebrating being voted a ""Best Place to Work"" in the morning, only to start laying off employees that same afternoon. This was handled in an unprofessional and insensitive manner, proving that most of Cisco's employee initiatives are just for appearances.

Internal structures and processes are outdated and dysfunctional, yet no one takes meaningful action to fix them. Instead of addressing inefficiencies, the company always chooses the easy way out—layoffs. They don't even attempt to reallocate employees to other internal positions when teams are restructured. Instead, they lay off existing employees and hire new ones for similar roles.

If you don’t mind constant instability, poor leadership, and a company that prioritizes image over employee well-being, then Cisco might be the place for you. But if you’re looking for long-term stability and career growth, I’d advise looking elsewhere."

- Mostly competitive pay
- Decent opportunity for movement
- Fully remote
- Fantastic individual contributor culture","Small stuff:
- Lots of meetings, but that's just remote tech life
- An already silo'd company feels extra silo'd when we are basically all remote
- Projects might not truly see the light of day, but that's the cold corporate world for you
- Can be hard to get converted from a contractor to a full-time employee

Big stuff:
- Executive leadership is ignorant of how people lower down the totem pole work. Or worse yet, they just don't care. Recent layoffs that hit the part of the company that had been meeting projections are laughable. All in the name of ""optimizing for growth around AI""
- Layoffs are happening twice a year at this point. TWICE. And they aren't small either. The ""always be hiring, always be firing"" method feels terrifying to work under.
- Cisco is a dinosaur (old) company. I think their focus on AI will lead them nowhere since there's no way they can keep up with the more modern, agile tech companies."

The teams are usually driven by certain groups of people who have the invisible ""authority"" and ""power"". The work is busy, but it's because of the disorganized and non-feedback work. This is due to the nature of ""solo"" work, e.g. This guy A handles feature X and he usually the only ""go-to"" person for X, no matter if there may be some better approach or at least some chances for guy A to receive feedback.

Some senior management is trying to change the company culture and fight back in the market by pushing Meraki to the front of the product line, but Meraki by itself is not an answer. The problems are deep and structural and they require knowledgeable, fearless leaders to make any progress. Unfortunately for Cisco, those are few and far between.

Chaos has ensued during each restructuring. Several board level leaders have left. Last minute decisions and chop changing by ELT because of poor decisions and inability to keep to long term plans.

The phrase care deeply is coined by ELT. Almost verging on a brain washing and gas lighting process because the actions do not match:

Announcing redundancies, then waiting 4 weeks before starting. leaving employee in the dark and creating huge amounts of stress.

Middle managers and employees are being squeezed, creating a toxic workplace. Employees forced into the list below. Fearful of saying anything, due to the every 2 year redundancies:

	• Accept targets that are over 4 months late and repay commissions retroactively.
	•	Cover increased number of product lines, despite inadequate training on the new offerings.
	•	Meet significantly increased targets, sometimes 6x or more.
	•	Take on multiple roles due to ongoing layoffs over the past year.

• No voluntary redundancy so accept all the above or leave of your own accord. 
• No training program to re-skill talent into new growth areas. Would rather fire and hire.

No pay increase to reflect these additional responsibilities."

Many employees appreciate Cisco’s focus on work-life balance, flexible work arrangements, and inclusive culture, which can make it an appealing workplace for those seeking stability and growth in the tech industry.","As a large, global corporation, Cisco’s size can sometimes mean that navigating internal processes and decision-making can be slow, with layers of bureaucracy that may delay project approvals or adaptability to change.

At least 3 that I am aware of. New hires are often chosen for this because they are largely more replaceable than engineers that have been there for 10+ years and are local experts that would be very hard to replace.

Great salary and benefits, I have an amazing team, and I personally see my impact across the company. These are all great qualities and why I would never want to leave. I could retire here…. But see cons.","It is a layoff culture. “Cognitive dissonance” are the two words employees should note as leadership fails to respect us in words what their behavior is communicating (see cisco’s response on 12/9, “committed to retaining talent” (paraphrased). It’s simply not true by their actions.

I think in the past four years I have experienced six layoffs and so far survived them all. The reality though is that we always know these layoffs are around the corner, and when the news is leaked (which it always is) people freak out (understandably!). Our last layoff required three+ months of not knowing who would have a job—that’s not going to help our bottom line (but I think is tied to a regulation). 

Though, root cause is not the timeline. It’s the layoff and (I think unintentional) dishonesty that kills me and has me in a bind—I love this company, but my stress can’t handle this company. I have a family to feed. 

Also, leadership is a bit out of touch. In the last layoff they remarked the percentage cut they would receive in bonus, which still resulted in multi million salaries (which was commented on in the chat as it happened, with the receipts… ouch!). That’s not consolation for the person who relies on their check to stay housed and feed their family, especially in this oversaturated market."

Flexible Working Hours:
The company offers flexible working hours, which has been a significant benefit. Employees are allowed to start and finish their workdays at times that suit their personal schedules, as long as they meet project deadlines and attend necessary meetings.

Remote Work Options:
Since the pandemic, Cisco has adopted a hybrid work model. Employees have the option to work from home several days a week, which greatly reduces commuting time and allows for a more comfortable and productive work environment.

Vacation and Time Off:
The company provides generous vacation days and encourages employees to use them. I never felt pressured to skip my vacations, and management genuinely supports taking time off to recharge.

Health and Wellness Programs:
Cisco offers various health and wellness programs, including gym memberships, yoga classes, and mental health resources. These programs are a testament to the company's commitment to the well-being of its employees.

Cisco provides a lot of resources and opportunities to explore what you uniquely bring to your work, lead with your strengths, practice mindfulness, and keep balance and flexibility in your life. It is a place that strives to be welcoming and supportive of diverse communities with a lot of employee resource groups to help. Their benefits are great and receiving 80 hrs per year to volunteer is simply amazing. I hope they don't cut that back.","The PTO is 20 days per year, but you are forced to use 3-4 for those days during the mandatory holiday shutdown period, so the PTO is effectively 16 or 17 days. 
They have had a lot of unannounced layoffs or ""restructuring"" since I joined.
And like any large corporation, a lot of the internal processes and requirements are like navigating a maze to follow. 
It is also very slow to move and coming from an acquisition this was a hard transition. Also, when we were acquired, we thought we would get more resources to help, but that was not the case. 
Despite the ideals for how to be a good leader and make Cisco a great place to work, individual managers may or may not follow, leaving much variability in the working environment on a particular team."

Work/Life Balance is good.","Back to laying off every 6 months. The most likely reason you will get laid off is ""this year's executive"" for your function wants to do things differently. Or your team is marooned in the wrong organization. How did your team get marooned? From last year's executive's re-org. Being re-orged into IT or Operations is a common death sentence and you should begin a 6 month exit plan as soon as it happens.

Leadership couldn't answer a ""How to return to growth?"" question after the most recent layoff. CEO had a ""hope in 6 months"" answer. Services EVP had a word salad. This was a seeded question in a moderated forum. Newly appointed Chief Product Officer is coming from a lackluster division (WebEx) and admitted to knowing nothing about Enterprise Networking.

There's a reason people come to Cisco and never leave, it's a company built by good people.","Do-nothing middle management, obsession with forecasting to the detriment of customer engagement, age bias toward Gen X and above for leadership which is stifling innovation and change. 

Recent influence from Palo Alto Networks refugees and Cisco outsiders are destroying what made Cisco different from peers in the industry - good culture. Three days a week centered on obsessively detailed metrics, overly rigid sales processes that destroy authenticity and creativity, fear-based sales culture around performance. There's also an unspoken but obvious effort to undermine longer term Cisco sellers with mercenary hires from outside the company that have no IT background whatsoever. New external leadership hires are telling partners that ""Cisco salespeople are lazy"". 

New sales leader is toxic and clueless about technology, reads from a script, does not understand what customers expect from a mature technology company like Cisco, and is inundating our sales force with administrative overhead that makes AMs/PSSs feel more like accountants. This is couched in a new mantra around ""creating a unified sales process"", but is bogging down sellers with hours upon hours of onerous training and administrative work."

Software engineer,4.0,"May 11, 2023","Former employee, less than 1 year","Everyone I interacted with was friendly, helpful, and professional. Although management pushed for hybrid working from what was previously full remote, it was a 'come at your own time' culture so long as you met your responsibilities. Break room had a fancy coffee machine, and management would cater lunches once a week. Most days I would come into the office to do any work that needed hands on configuration of our testbed in the lab, grab lunch, then continue to work from home.","Well I was laid off after 6 months so obviously layoffs. The late night or early morning meetings to catch up with the India team was tiresome. An incredible breadth of information you have to have a working knowledge of. Every protocol, the custom OS's and commands on the devices, and how to work with Cisco proprietary systems like SD-WAN. You have to learn the CLI commands before you can move onto GUI since you can't accomplish many things with a GUI alone. Personally, my manager was outright adversarial with me as a junior. I was put under the wing of 3 different people in trying to acclimate to the job, it was highly stressful trying to get up to speed. Few transferable skills: I worked with an python library that was eventually made open source, but there wasn't too much documentation and few employers care about my experience with a library that's solely used to test networks."

Director,3.0,"Feb 23, 2024","Former employee, more than 10 years","Above average compensation.
It used to be the culture.... hopefully it can be recessitated.","Culture is decaying with growing pockets of toxic teams. Leadership that is being promoted have either made a pledge of loyalty to the leadership above or they are a ""yes Sir"" kind of person. So, it has become a norm to see toxic VPs that did not make it to their positions based on merit and see them openly exhibit some of the most outrageously toxic behaviors (condescending, see differing opinions as ""falling out of line"", etc.). This leads to most of the Director level being disempowered and having to balance self preservation with doing the right thing for the business & the employees. The remaining layers of management are each less empowered than the layer above them. This leads to individual contributors that are struggling to contribute because navigating the trickling down toxicity is consuming most of their time and mental cycles. 
The problem is not limited to VP and below. It start with the glaring void of a Head of Engineering in the C-Suite. Each Business Unit Head reports to the CEO - thus making the CEO the one to lead technology direction, prioritizations and the biggest one: getting the BUs to work together to deliver on a platform strategy. That would be great if Chuck was Elon or Jeff B. - but he is not. So, he has outsourced those decisions to be based on C-Suite consensus - the very reason why the C-Suite has resorted to running like the Senate - alliances, lobbying, trading favors, etc. Oh, and the CFO ... he runs the financials like an accountant - I bet Cisco's books have never looked better :-). But top talent is walking to the competition, moral is at an all time low, and innovation (through acquisition, ""Spin In"" , or internal investments) is at a stand still since Kelly left. But I bet those books look good :-). BTW, Splunk does not qualify as ""innovation infusion"". There are plenty of ""innovation"" activities talked about by BU leader turned Chief Strategy Officer (who still cannot get herself to fully perform the CSO role because she has not let go of her BU leader identity - so, she is the CSO but also leads Applications *shake head*). Activities only - no results - no successful monetization. It does not take much to understand why innovation is dead, the culture has turned highly political and toxic, and now business performance is impacted (it's not just due to macroeconomic). It is sad to see such a great company deteriorate at such a rapid pace. It's making it obvious that the #1 Place to Work ranking is a paid PR service. However, I do have to say that out of the entire C-Suite, Fran is the only executive that is delivering results (you may not like or agree with the results or approach but she is delivering). 
What is the CEO succession plan (as Chuck is in semi-retirement mode and focused on building personal legacy/brand vs running a company)?
What is the board thinking & doing??? Fiduciary duty anyone?"

Other Pros: RSUs are good, ESPP is standard, company has a diverse product portfolio that is potentially well-suited for economic challenges, senior management seems okay *I haven't paid too much attention to them* Honestly, I do truly believe that Cisco has the potential to be a great company that is able to attract top talent in Silicon Valley. However, the company needs to reevaluate middle management. Investing in management training is the bare minimum and they're currently are doing that, but the company really needs to do more. For example, promoting individuals based on their leadership qualities and not just their technical knowledge and years of experience. Cultivating a more progressive and open-minded culture could go a long way in improving employee satisfaction and retention.","Disappointed by: dental and vision options, have to pay to use company gym, a lot of teams are starting to require ""return to office"" which is going to hurt the company as they are also trying to downsize their real estate, poor laptop options if you need a non-MacBook. Please take all high ratings and company awards lightly, as Cisco does push it's current employees to skew the results.

At least in the organization I work, many people are here to just coast, so if you want to grow and get experience, you have to be proactive and patient to make the best use of your time.","I worked with some of the worst people. They were arrogant, emotionally immature, overly defensive, and surprisingly incompetent / out of touch - maybe byproducts of the coasting culture? I also worked with people who were highly capable and professional, so it might've been just a bad luck. Heavy layers of professional middle managers. Constant restructuring (aka layoff) ordered by the leadership who doesn't understand what's happening in the field and things are generally messy because of that.

We have had many customers leave Cisco products for Palo Alto or other vendors simply because our products are garbage now, and the TAC support is atrocious.

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Nov 30, 2023","Former employee, more than 3 years","Definitely one of the best companies to work for in terms of work life balance. Atleast it’s true in terms of the team I worked for in Bangalore. 
Was extremely lucky to have had amazing managers.","Work was ok initially as a young engineer I got to learn a lot, but as you grow in your career as an SDE your opportunities to learn kinda reduces as you have a lot of senior folk around and you might not end up getting your due recognition and opportunities.

Promotions are difficult as you grow can be said the same for other companies.

Salary hikes are mediocre reasons being budget constraints but company has the budget to spend billions to buy Splunk

Opportunities to switch to a team in US usually gets shot down by pathetic Executives in the US and India. Even if the other team really likes you and wants you there. Basically favourites of those people might get a chance in the future if an opportunity presents itself.

Overall salary compared to other major companies in the market it’s below the market average. I’ve seen smaller and bigger companies who were willing to offer close to 40LPA for the same role.

Lots of reorgs and uncertainty, priorities keep changing and most recently in our team one person had to do 2-3 people’s work would have been valuable if the work was something cutting edge but it basic UI work and some simple backend services to setup simple API routes to serve content to the UI. Definitely got bored and burnt out quite fast."

This is awesome! The CEO Chuck Robbins and the ETL team is simply amazing and they listen An over all autonomy of work is practiced Great work like balance and it is encouraged if you happen to be a workaholic. Overall comradery still exists in Cisco, Cisconians actually care for each other.","The work can sometimes have longer time lines due to processes being in place and it may seem like a slow moving ship sometimes, at the same time processes mean consistency and hassle free audits in the larger scheme of things.

I mean it. benefits, business travel quality, etc. -Great bonding & relationship with fellow peers. -Sales performers are rewarded and recognized. A very satisfying feeling that money cannot buy. (sales champions, chairmans club ,etc) -Great products, strong channel & partner ecosystem. -Partners, customers respect the brand. Makes the selling fun, challenging and a bit easy. -Account manager have power, authority and accountability. -Entire org will come forward to win a deal for and with you. -Fast, less bureaucratic, focus on execution and speed.","-The experience is not uniform and will vary from team to team, manager to manager. While I was fortunate to have amazing managers, peers, I did see certain segments /managers were toxic, career derailing for a few of my friends. Situation can get political/diplomatic. -unrealistic sales number pressure. -you need a bit of luck -commit pressure is unreal at time. (you will love it or hate it) -not every product sells. For eg servers, webex, security sales is tough. So if you are getting in these product sales role - do your research. -The IT hardware is getting commoditized with transformation of SAAS, cloud. Has lots a bit of its charm in recent years. -Cloud, SAAS, Security is paying better these days. (2023). -Career movement / horizontally/ globally is limited. -work life balance very bad if you are in India. I have spend 70% of my weekends working (no one asks, but expects). Something that flows from top, especially in India. Not sure if that has changed since 2022.
-No career/skip manager discussions for professional growth. 

I left Cisco in 2022 as I didn't see any guidance on career growth, plan. I was getting bored. I went ahead for an interview outside to merely assess my market value and get some insights outside of Cisco world. I was shocked at the industry comp being offered. (mind you, i never asked for a single raise. I just believed in Cisco).  Having said, Cisco has been wonderful in so many ways for me. I'll always be grateful and Cisco will always hold a special place. There is never a dull moment and it will prepare you for your future.  I was lucky to be a Cisco."

Network consulting engineer,2.0,"Sep 13, 2023","Current employee, more than 8 years","I guess you could say 401k match is comparable to other competitors. Health care options - HMO / PPO with excellent benefits (like low co-pay, etc.) ESPP are a good benefit you should take advantage of. Work from home option is a perk. There are a lot of excellent engineers with a breadth of knowledge that you can reach out to for assistance. Most are willing to help and are friendly. People are smart here. For the most part. There are bonuses as well. Paid bi-annually. Amount is based on your grade / company performance / personal performance.","Let's list them: 1- middle managers are more or less cheerleaders. Esp people managers. They are also bogged down in a lot of busy meetings. So, you get ignored, for the most part. Not because of you. They are too busy. In busy meetings. Which are stacked. 2 - career stagnation. you will not move ANYWHERE unless you apply internally, which takes, what? 15 to 25 internal interviews? this is pointless and discouraging. 3 - constant layoffs. not always based on performance. in fact, the reason is never revealed to you. So no one knows why / how they were targeted. And its usually annually. right before X-Mas holidays. NICE. Cisco LOVES RIFs. And the funny thing is, they encourage you to apply internally. As if its that easy. See above. 4 - stock price is stagnant and not going anywhere. And hasn't gone anywhere for a lot of years. Well, maybe it trickled up by a few dollars per share. So those RSU benefits I listed above? You won't get rich, folks. 5 - Pointless numerous meetings with people managers, bi-weekly, 1:1. Expecting us to ""grow, grow, grow."" God forbid you don't look busy on your timesheets for your billing hours. They also expect you to know the management chain. When you are near the bottom. OKAY. Sure, I will memorize the names and roles of those 6 layers up, and talk candidly about their visions and what they are seeking. 6 - Mgmt - If you have a toxic manager, you will have a miserable experience. Because this company is stagnant. So you are stuck on the team unless you apply internally. And of course, pass those 25 interviews. Which can take a year and a half. 7 - Upper Mgmt - Don't ever reach out directly to them unless you want to get burnt. They expect you to reach out to their assistant directly. Assuming they have an assistant. They can't / won't be bothered. 8 - Internal technical training - yes they have it. And its not the best. Try 3rd party vendors which are far superior, like INE. 9 - Salary increase. Doesn't exist. And if it does, its basically nothing. Better to simply quit and come back as a different grade. Also salaries are on lower end of the spectrum in a comparable role at a competitor. Salaries depend quite a bit on your geographic region as well."

Manager (research lead),3.0,"Nov 30, 2022","Former employee, more than 3 years",Remote work 100% in some roles/business units. Bonuses around 10-15%. Extreme flexibility with location -- my department didn't care if people wanted to relocate (to other countries even!). Decent work/life balance.,"Remote culture means it's hard to build connections. Lack of leadership vision. Every quarter it was all about VP shuffling. Very hard to get promoted, very hard to get salary lift. I was there for 3 years before they offered me equity (a very paltry 5-figure amount to be paid over 4 years). Salary is nowhere near FAANG equivalent. 2x year layoffs. US health insurance was very Cali-focused, so if you're trying to use it or live outside of California, be prepared for $$$ visits and prescriptions. There isn't a lot of prestige to the Cisco name anymore (despite what they tell you internally). Cisco bungled the WebEx opportunity during the pandemic. If you are still early and energetic in your career, get what you can out of the experience in a year or two, and plan to leave. For those of you mid-late career, this could be a good place to 'rest and vest' if you can survive the layoff seasons."

Retirement Plans: Many companies offer retirement plans such as 401(k) or pension plans. Cisco's retirement plan may include matching contributions to the employee's savings. Life Insurance: Cisco may offer life insurance benefits that provide financial support to the employee's beneficiaries in the event of their death.","Cost: While employee benefits are designed to be a benefit to the employee, some benefits can be expensive. Employees may have to pay a portion of the cost of their benefits package, which can be a financial burden. Limited Coverage: Not all benefits packages offer comprehensive coverage. Some benefits may have exclusions or limitations that could limit the employee's access to the care they need. Inflexibility: Some benefits packages may not be flexible enough to meet the needs of all employees.

Its not personal. Comp Plan changes too much but we are evolving as a Company so it is expected, if you don't like change don't come here. Note this con can be for any job. My job has only been as good as the accounts I support and my team. Past 2 years I have had decent accounts, a great support team and great manager.

At the same time product management is given complete decision authority on features. 3) Slightly lower pay than the leading companies in Big Tech. 4) Random waves of layoffs that often impact great people, while the not-so-great people remain. Random waves of layoffs have been happening since 2014. Then they try to rehire. 5) 360 reviews are non-existent. If you have a problem with your manager, there is nobody to talk to on a regular basis. 6) Company is emotional and impulsive when it comes to 'disruptive' technologies. Instead of working internally on trying to develop products and technologies for new markets, the company prefers to acquire start-ups with great pitch books. Only to realize a couple of years later that it was too good to be true. Please perform due diligence.
7) In some JDM activities, brazen dishonesty is tolerated by the company from their counterparty. In other words, when a JDM partner substitutes its A-team for its F-team, Cisco turns a blind eye to it and does not demand accountability. As a result, Cisco ends up doing the work internally while pretending that the JDM did it."

Cisco tac engineer,4.0,"Feb 16, 2023","Former employee, more than 3 years","Great work culture and managers. Lot of projects (work) is available and people are available to help everywhere. The team culture in general is great across all teams. If you have to do anything with networks and networks is your long term career goal then there is absolutely no better place than Cisco. There is a LOT of training available , high end labs with tons of devices and opportunities to do so many industry level certificates and all this is free of cost.","At the end of the day it is a network support role after all. Even if you might take up a lot of automation python projects but you have to take care of your cases/.backlog. You might feel burnt out in few high severity cases as well (very similar to what software devs face when their 'feature' is about to 'go live') but that gets easier with time and experience. The nature of the job can be viewed in 2 ways : Positive : You are Sherlock Holmes who has to investigate and use your skills on multiple cases. Negative : Your work basically starts when things are going wrong. So you are almost always. dealing with a mental 'timer' as they are people waiting for you to provide solutions or answers and most of the times it is not easy. Multiple logs , timestamps, data correlation and since you are not the one who has written the code. Except few rare days mostly you will have a lot of emails to write and multiple logs to check. Salary growth can be slow ( as far as I am aware 10-18% is standard) however if your communication with management is positive and your manager assures you then it can be worth the wait. Exponential increment after a span of 2-3 years is common I have heard. This will vary a lot based on an individual's exp and work they have put in so not really a con. Lot of mandatory trainings :-P"

We do leadership training every year and are provided with industry training like agile principles, multi-cloud, troubleshooting, design thinking, customer service, and security. Sr management tries to communicate well, giving leaders a heads up, then letting everyone quickly know. We also love the inclusion of all people and how we celebrate people and customs from all parts of the world! Even our Russian employees were looked after without embracing what their country was doing. It was just amazing to watch how we cared for each other, as well as for people in Ukraine and our people helping others, especially in Poland.","Too many directives and micromanagement from above instead of letting Directors and Sr Managers lead and manage their budgets. For example, many still need SVP approval to travel. Layoffs are part of the company culture that is used even in the good times. People are brainwashed into thinking it is OK to treat people this way and they go along with it as they have no idea how it is to be in someone's shoes that were laid off. It is now even called a ""Workforce Transition Options"" as that sounds better than ""layoff"", and they really have no good options."

The additional stress and attempt to normalize the fear of losing your job constantly.. NO THANK YOU. Also huge RTP presence means lots of conservative, christian republicans. Lots of work needed in the D&I space. No formal review, no chance of promotion. People are treated as replaceable resources. 3 managers in 2 years. Didnt see a single team mate promoted in 3 years, even people that had been there 6+ years. Employees have Stockholm syndrome, “feel so lucky they survived the last LR”. The pay is horrrrible for the bay area and they do not give annual increases.. period. If youre lucky youll get a promotion every 5 years. If you are able to keep the same manager for more than 8 months. How this place makes it to the “best places to work” list..... they're clearly bribing someone."

Application operation,2.0,"Dec 29, 2022","Former employee, more than 8 years","- High caliber employees with high caliber results delivered - Great learning and development opportunities at all levels provided by Cisco - Great people that generally care about one another depending upon the department - Personally progressed several levels within my career, as a woman, with generally good support and coaching from leadership - Cisco tries to take care of their employees even in the hardest times such as redundancies - Work life balance could be good if you are in a supportive department allowing it","- Over the years as an acquisition of Cisco, they massively struggled with what to do with the AppD business. This had a major impact on innovation, strategy, and stable leadership of the AppD business. - Over the past year, Cisco is heavily focused on further integration of the AppD business creating fear-based dynamics of employees concerned about their job, pushiness when it comes to strategy moves, lack of care about impact to AppD functions and capacity drain on employees. - No psychological safety within the business at present - Employees that have been within the AppD business for years are expendable to Cisco; All executive leadership have exited and they are bringing in ""Cisco people"" to take over. - Some direction now in strategy, but who knows how long that will last as the trend as been to move in a certain direction and then it doesn't work out. As a hardware company, Cisco is struggling with what to do with AppD from a strategy perspective. - Work/life balance is a struggle in the Operations functions as Cisco tightens their purse strings but keeps dumping loads of work/expectations on an already lean team - Sales culture is very stressed due to all the extra burden being placed on them from an admin and process-oriented perspective. In addition, Enablement of Sales teams is a mess and creates confusion for Sales more than sets them up for success. - Extremely hard to get pay increases within teams for high performers. Wages are based on Cisco banding as a hardware company and Software companies in the market are offering significantly higher wages for the same roles. - Once Cisco came in to take over in the last year, they stopped listening to the advice of most tenured team members within AppD who knew the AppD business best. They made decisions without thinking of the impact for those ""on the ground"" doing the work. - New product launches going out without being fully operationalized. Rushed to market due to being behind and needing to catch up. Creating impact to Sales and potentially customer experience."

It's a two-edged sword, but having the option to take a WebEx from home, Starbucks, airports, the beach, or in the office ... permits a level of versatility -- and fully acceptable by colleagues and management -- that would be hard to repeat elsewhere.  It's part of the culture.  The flipside is that work more easily creeps into your personal space and follows you on vacation if you're not careful.  Another consequence is that Cisco offices can feel like ghost towns.

Cisco has an immensely successful and rich portfolio and is well-positioned for the future.  But ... for the past few years, it has felt like Cisco is constantly trying to turn a corner ... and never quite making it.","The biggest con nowadays is that Cisco is trying vigorously to grow income faster than revenue.  This translates to what seems like a never ending round of budget cuts and divestment.  Workforce reductions are becoming more common than pay raises and the value proposition to working here is becoming harder to defend.

Consulting systems engineer,4.0,"Dec 11, 2015","Current employee, more than 8 years","Cisco is a fun place to work, at least if you're in the sales part of the business. You can usually work from home and take flexible hours provided you're serving your customers well.

Career options are great, you can move around the business relatively easily. Opportunities to move to different countries are frequent and often encouraged.

Lots of opportunities to do side projects and define your own activities. Very little 'micro-managing'.

Rewards outside of base pay are encouraged and easy to distribute, creating a good culture with positive feedback.","No inflationary payrises. Very difficult to get promotions without being a skilled political operative. Managers powerless to help employees in this area as they don't control any budget. Everything goes through a big HR machine. Everything and everyone is a number and cost to be reduced.

Managers are usually looking upwards focussed on their own careers, not paying attention to their employees. Can go months without a performance review or any guidance as to your own career. Promotions, payrises etc all shrouded in secrecy.

Leavers usually not replaced, or replaced slowly. Being 5 heads down is common and workload thrown to employees without any consultation or apology. This in turn affects sales commission.

Technical strategy is weak in areas due to massive in-fightning between business units. Huge egos run parts of the business. Fear is a frequently used motivational tool."

The early days were the best when you actually worked as part of a team. I learned a lot and enjoyed the work/life balance. The continuous training available was always top-notch. If you want to find someplace to hide and retire, there are plenty of dark holes in Cisco to do it.","Too much turnover! Senior people are put in positions they should not hold and this includes the majority of management. If you are not in your director's inner circle then you may as well pack your bags. To get into the inner circle you just have to play the game, kiss the right behinds, and squawk a lot. You don't actually have to work, you just have to be a puppet. If you dance enough little monkey, they may toss you a shilling. The ""People Deal"" and ""Stack Rank"" are horrendous and just created a cutthroat mentality, absolutely destroying teams.

It has gone from being the most rewarding and enjoyable job to an unhealthy call center environment. The VP decided to fix something that was not broken and make everyone work out of the RTP office instead of hiring real raw talent. The director rules by fear and walks the floor to make sure people don't leave before exactly 5pm on a Friday afternoon (this job is requires long hours and they don't allow you to put in overtime, mind you), and you have little or no support from operations. Half of my peers were either in therapy or needed it, and they were always so terrified to come in every day.

Anonymous employee,4.0,"Dec 19, 2008",Current employee,"I like the flexibility of my job and the diversity of cisco's workforce. I have good opportunities to work on a wide range of interesting projects with people all around the globe.

I'm very grateful and proud to work at Cisco. In the current economic downturn, I believe Sr Management is working hard to avoid layoffs (by cutting contingent workforce and expenses first--who knows what the future will bring?). I also think they're being open and transparent about it and are generally doing the right things.

The hours and work locations are flexible; I am able to work from home often.","The lack of coordination across projects is appalling. It seems like I work in a giant crowd of project managers who do nothing but run around in circles looking for projects to manage. There are waaaay too many 'boards and committees,' the function of which is mainly interfering and delaying projects. People at the middle-management layers are simply not incented to work together, despite all the talk about collaboration on the part of Sr. 

Management. As such, political skills pass for leadership and the people who have the best political skills get promoted. The political realities often ignore development realities, which leads to a scramble of ass-covering.

The collaboration technologies are over-hyped. While telepresence is good for demos and meetings where people just talk to each other and show presentations, the lack of interactive whiteboarding and 'working' collaboration technologies cripples my ability to do 'real work' with my colleagues across the globe.

Product development processes are also crippled; there's either no process at all or people use process as a tool for delay and obfuscation. This is the bureaucracy at Cisco."
Software engineer iv,3.0,"Jun 18, 2010",Current employee,"great brains to work with.
Very flexible working hours. Nobody will even care whether you are even coming to the office a day. You can use the WFH lavishly. Overall a great work culture anybody can dream of.","Salary is not up to the market levels, its understandable for a company like cisco having a huge headcount. But the problem here is that when they decides to give increments, they  decides to give more % hike to the guys whos sitting in the upper level or whoever is earning more. Overall all the scenario is rich becomes richer. 

One more bad thing is the hardened processes. Doesn't matter whether you are doing a small silly task or not the number of processes you have to do consumes way more time than it takes for actual tasks itself. This repeated unwanted bureaucracy driven processes will make you terribly bored and give you headache and dizziness every single day.

I doubt the india team still does have a proper direction for their growth, everyone still relies on the big SJ team and folks here are somewhat getting considered as a second grade people. whenever a good work comes in to thewider  team, its gone to the SJ. And you gets bored keepon doing the same old maintenance work. Just to make your mouths shut, once in a blue moon day you get some crap new stuff. after that again you do the same thing."

2) Size of the site: it's a pretty big site (1600+ employees) with a quite low average age: people in Cisco Krakow are fun!","1) Middle management in Cisco Krakow is really mediocre, and definitely not diverse. Most managers are Poles and while there's this appearance of inclusion and diversity within the company, at the end of the day you'll see locals (or Ukranians, the second biggest community) progressing in their career,  getting promotions, recognitions, and so on... while it happens way too rarely for internationals (in proportion with the number of people, of course).

2) Being a low cost center in a saturated market like Krakow, the quality of talent Cisco manages to get there is not so high.

3) No meritocracy AT ALL.

4) No metrics/KPI / good place for early retirement: you will find lots of people in who just put in a few hours of work per day, get to work at 10:00, leave at 15:000, go for groceries in the meantime... and nobody cares, because there is no way whatsoever to measure anybody's performance (beside in a very few roles). Management doesn't even notice it.

5) Other departments within Cisco, in the regions, do not have a high respect for centralized low cost centers."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 15, 2017",Former employee,This company has a big name in tech so it is a resume builder for sure regardless of your personal experience within the company.,"If you are young in your career Cisco can be a nightmare. Managers have absolutely no idea what you do from day to day and seem to care little about that. You can go months without talking to your manager if you want. Managers couldn't care less about your professional development. Having sync up calls with your manager to discuss development is literally a joke because they will help you with nothing. Cisco is losing talent fast and a big reason is because they pay poor, the company is too bureaucratic  for career growth, and management is completely lousy. In my four years at Cisco I've had 5 or 6 managers and I can only say that one of them was a good/great one. Oh and I almost forgot. If you are early in your career forget about proper training. Cisco is absolutely horrendous and training new talent for the work force. This is literally a sink or swim company. You come in on your first day after a couple years out of college and your manager is looking at you to close million dollar deals with no proper product, role, or field training. They'll just say figure it out or browse the companies 70k people to find someone who can give you advice. They don't even assign you a mentor. The ability for people to work from home has turned the office to a ghost town so if you enjoy he presence of other human being you better forget about it here."

I have sent mails to VP's and even the President of the company and have always been treated with respect and deference.  That is very telling on what a true open door policy looks like.

I think the greatest support for Cisco statistically is that people who work here don't leave.  I'm in a high level consulting position and get constant job offers, but no other companies create as compelling and challenging of a work environment as Cisco has to offer.

Absolute great company to work for, and has my highest recommendation from a 15 year industry vet who has worked for top companies around the world including Microsoft.","Typical Company cons that can all be summed up by ""slow moving"".

"Manager, product marketing",3.0,"Jun 25, 2008",Current employee,The level of talent at Cisco is generally quite high and a cut above other companies. The compensation package is generally solid though raises have not kept up with the rest of the valley and Cisco is no longer significantly better than other companies. The sheer size of Cisco allows one to move into other areas of interest and find new opportunities if they desire to branch out.,"Hours are long and work loads high. If you make an effort to take time off management will be supportive in my experience but they will not go out of their way to encourage work life balance. The company will suck you dry if you let it. Competition for advancement is very keen, especially at the grade 11/12 level and politics will often play a very significant role since there will almost always be several qualified people. Career development is non-existent even for those who have been labeled ""high potential"".

The management at the Director and Sr. Director level is the weakest in the company and contains a significant number of political infighters and deadwood. This creates management paralysis and limits growth opportunities for others."
Hardware engineer iv,3.0,"Mar 23, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco is a great place for work/life balance - I would high recommend Cisco for working moms. There is the flexibility of working from home if need be - best thing is people do not abuse that system. You have access to a wealth of informations - technical talks, seminars, classes to enhance technical knowledge. There are also leadership classes to hone leadership skills. Extensive use of IT tools and Web made all the processes online and very seamless. I personally believe the salary, compensation and benefits are at par with the valley companies. Overall, its a great place to have fun and work at the same time.","One of the biggest complaint I have against Cisco is it's career development plan & implementation for the employees. The ePM every year talks about the growth and career plan - but in reality the managment is always driven by very near term goals and not long term vision. As a result all the career development plans of individual contributors do not go anywhere - again next year the ePM comes and the story repeats. There is not much functional rotation as well - its very hard to convince Level1/2 manager why I would want to move from his/her group and go to another group to do something else - instead of encouraging the individual's passion to do something of his/her interest in another group, the manager is worried about shrinking empire if an employee is lost to another group."

Still the premier tech name out there, at least when it comes to hardware and networking.","Very passive aggressive culture. Can be a difficult place for people who prefer directness. People rarely actually say no to anything and so you waste time doing things that never had a chance to gain full support, and you need to herd cats across multiple functions (this is the classical functional siloed company) to get anything done (this ties to the plus that it is a very collaborative culture - you have to work with others to get anything done). Support functions are awful, especially HR. Seriously, this is the worst HR function in the history of business. If you want to see what a company is like that operates on non-sensical policies, and where you can't do something logical because it is against policy, welcome to Cisco. Especially with regards to HR. WPR writes reports on how much space we're using and how much energy we've saved because we decided to get rid of the coffee machine. Seriously, why do we have people whose job includes spending time doing this??!??!?"
Software engineer iv,3.0,"Sep 5, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years","Some things like pay for performance in certain BUs is true (the one I worked at least). Your bonus is a direct reflection of whether you go extra mile (or) stay 10-5. For a large company they have fantastic CAP(monetary appreciation or gift card) award programs for folks who go above and beyond (which I don't see with most employers) , well defined RSU structure and a much better than average 401k plan. You can work from anywhere as long as you get the work done your manager does not care if you don't show up at 9:00AM. Fantastic team mates and managers!.","Your base salary is low. Lately there has been lot of chopping and churning of work force non-stop. Some mandatory people movements across business units may or may not be liked by you but you have to live with it. Very difficult to move across to other BUs where interesting work is done, often they give huge weight to ""current experience"" - even for a very good performer if you don't have the exact skill match they're not ready to train you and in an effect you become stale and lazy over time because the desire to move around (which can be a big motivator to stay around) gets killed. Huge bias towards work done in by spin-ins. Some times they're deliberate they don't want your product/BU to thrive irrespective of you meeting H/W release deadlines."

Software engineer ii,4.0,"Oct 2, 2008",Current employee,"I was hired by Cisco choice program, in which new hires can choose their teams based on how they like to work or who to work for. Since most teams need more people, managers squeeze their brains to attract the new hires into their team. Before the new hires choose their teams, they are exposed to most information about projects and benefits or drawbacks of each team which is tipped by managers, who pamper the new hires badly (I thought I'm the king of cisco during the period - once I chose my team, my heyday was over..). This is an example of cisco how this company tries to lay out best environment for their employees.","The largest problem in cisco is its size. It is a big guy, which means its decision making process is very slow. Officially my reporting structure is not that complicated; manager, general manager, director, and VP (there are more, but in my position, I doubt that I can see anyone of them).

Managers are generally open minded and encourage asking tough questions and challenging the status quo. Industry Leader. Still a growth company.  Compensation and benefits are excellent. For instance, the medical and dental package is 2nd to none and much better than most other comparable companies.  “If you are uncomfortable with change, Cisco might not be the place for you. There are significant leadership and strategy changes as we adapt to different markets. Many projects we work on are started and stopped haphazardly by product marketing or senior leadership.","“- Many things in the new hire process are unorganized for new employees. I particularly dislike the 2+ week overhead trying to get initial items setup.
- Expectations for corporate culture may be put on badges, but I am not feeling the type of camaraderie that I had, nor the new employee immersing expectations that occurred for my last job with ""Big Chip Inc"". It's starting to feel like more people are there putting in their 9 - 5 instead of being there because they enjoy their work more. Then again I am biased and so is my viewpoint of being a Software Engineer.”"
Technical marketing engineer,3.0,"Jul 10, 2013","Former employee, more than 10 years","You would think that at a company that owns more than 70% marketshare would be frought with ego and islands.  This might be true as you start moving up the food chain, however at the individual contributor level - there is a great deal of comraderie as everyone feels like a ""little fish"" in a big pond - and even the most veteran employees - still would collaborate.  There is a great sense of trust.  The culture is extremely collaborative with an idea that we are all virtually on the same team (because eventually you probably will be.)  A LOT of cross-teaming and matrix ran projects across the board.  I might be subjective because I had the fortune of working out of the bay area - I know that Cisco employees that were not close to corporate had less than nice things and feelings about it.","The only constant is change.  In over 10 years, I had over 10 managers without really having to change teams very much.  There seems to be a lot of flexibility within the org structure that ends up with a lot of revisions to applications, tools, processes, and structure.  

Talk about frugal!!! No free sodas anymore- and the cafeteria prices are higher than some of the restaurants that are within walking distance of campus.  There are basically no more perks left at Cisco other than the chance to use a macbook air as your standard pc and that somewhere someone back in engineering has probably created an ""app for that"" if you can't find what you're looking for on the intranet."

Amazing benefits including a full week of paid leave for charity volunteering. Love how much the company gives back to society.,"Very rare to get a salary increase, so be sure you're OK with the salary you accept. Lots of churn in mid-management, I've had 13 managers in seven years. Tough to get your ideas heard, unless you're politically minded. Since the company is so large, there are a lot of slackers who coast along just under the radar, which can be de-motivating. Very engineering driven with design, and user experience, as an afterthought. There is also no clear career path for designers. Design is not handled in a traditional manner, so collaborating with fellow designers is rare- instead you're assigned a product and become silo'ed in it."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 6, 2016","Former employee, more than 10 years","- The people are incredibly sharp and supportive (with a few exceptions). 
- Pockets of leadership are outstanding. 
- The benefits are second to none. Good restricted stock options, 401K, ESPP.
- Teleworking option - allows for better work / life balance (sort of - see below)","- ENDLESS meetings. Back-to-back-to-back...Think 8 solid hours starting at 6 AM. 
- It's great that so many of the employees have the flexibility to be remote. However, I noticed that it has meant many employees are dis-engaged, going thru the motions. 
- Count on the annual re-org happening -- which means annual layoffs
- I personally have worked at Cisco for more than 15 years and got let go. Cisco may say they want you to retire there, which I was convinced I would...I was so loyal to that company, then suddenly got let go. It was pretty brutal to say the least. I essentially got kicked out of the family.  
- There's ""juniorization"" of the workforce going on here. They are trying to bring down the average age so if you are 23, good for you. If you are 38 or above, chances are it will be difficult for you to make your case. Millennials seem to hold a lot of importance at this company. Experience is no longer prime currency
- Changes going on in leadership and the way work gets done is highly, highly distracting. 
- Employee morale is extremely low"
Virtual customer success manager,5.0,"Jun 4, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year","I love working here and the support you get from all levels of management can't be beat. People think sometimes that when you work for a large company like Cisco, you'll somehow get overlooked. But I can tell you that's not the case. You get to work with the smartest people in the industry who truly believe in educating and enabling their employees. Everyday, I feel like I've made an impact, and that my value is being recognized. I advocate everyday for my friends to work here because it is absolutely the best place to be. Customer Success is taking the industry by storm right now, and there is not a better company to be working with.  Cisco has always been a thought leader, and they recognize how critical Customer Success is for our customers. I can't wait to see how this group grows and transforms within the coming months. It's one of the most rewarding careers being able to work so closely with customers to truly understand their business, and how we can help them reach their business outcomes. If you want to learn, grow and be surrounded by passionate, motivated people - this is where you'll find them!","It's a newer team, so naturally there are still some things they are trying to work out in terms of what technology we align to and other little nuances... but it doesn't take away from the value you deliver as a CSM or the overall experience of working there.  It's more of a growing pain than a con! :)"

Program manager,4.0,"Jun 13, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco strongly enables their employees even at the individual contributor level.  If you have good ideas and the drive to enable them, you can do well.

Of course, as with any large company, alot depends on your group and your direct manager.  However, mobility is generally encouraged from group to group and the tools are there for you to take advantage of it.  

Other reasons to work at Cisco are the ability to be involved with cutting edge technology and processes.  Cisco strives to be ahead of the curve both in terms of the products and the way we work.  

There are many great minds at work at Cisco and it energizes you to be around them each day.","The bell curve is enforced for ratings/rankings and it does not always lead to good results for Cisco or the employee.

The ratings and rankings system can be unfair and hold people back who should be promoted.  There is not a lot of consistency from group to group and if you're stuck in a group where there are a lot of high performers, you can be unfairly penalized.  

As the company gets older, there can be a tendency to fall back on tried and true ways rather than innovating.  Management says they want to encourage new ways of working but if it impacts their bottom line or they are afraid setbacks will reflect poorly on them, that can stand in the way of change."
Marketing communications manager,5.0,"Jan 27, 2019","Current employee, less than 1 year","While Cisco is a huge and global company, you have a sense of belonging to something bigger than yourself. There’s ways to get involved to navigate the vastness, for example tuning into our company all hands meeting, also known as the Cisco Beat. This is an opportunity to hear firsthand our leadership’s top of mind and where Cisco is focused as a company. Another way to get involved is by joining an Employee Resource Organization (ERO), such as Early Career Network or Connected Women. These employee organizations are communities that help you grow personally and professionally by connecting you with others who share similar interests and come from similar backgrounds. It is a chance to experience the wonderful diversity that exists within Cisco . Lastly, the flexibility that Cisco has is unmatched. For example, just this past Thanksgiving Holiday I fell ill and not well enough to go into the office. Luckily, with our flexible working policies and my agreement with my manager, I was able to work the entire week from home – no missed meetings!","Aforementioned, Cisco is a large company where success is emphasized by maintaining one’s own personal network and development. You have your roles and responsibilities but an added layer of continuous self-improvement through development courses and scoping careers on Cisco’s career site that might fit with your skillset. In other words, any role at Cisco won’t be an 8am-5pm Monday-Friday set-schedule job – but it will be as good as you make it!"
Cisco tac engineer,4.0,"Jan 24, 2022","Current employee, more than 1 year","Company Culture is amazing, And I really mean it. I planned to join cisco for a year or two max before leaving, out of college. But the Culture has made me love this place. Especially in TAC, which operates at its own level in most things.

So much to learn, the amount of knowledge is insane, the regular Technical Leaders at Cisco has would be equivalent, to Principle Engineers in most Companies. You never stop learning, every one and anyone you can ping, sync up and learn from.","Salary, 
One of the biggest down side, I see is the inflated salaries being offered for roles similar if not, ever more basic then what we do everyday in TAC. 
Being a global company, the company is able to acquire talent and resources at anywhere and bring them up. Which has shrunk the teams in US, by what seems to be by design of Execs. To run barely breathing teams in US.

In my role I was often able to work from home without recrimination, as were most people.  Generally really liked the people, but in a company that large there are bound to be some jerks.","To this day it boggles my mind how poorly managed the company as a whole is.  They have layoffs every year and never seem to figure out that its because they have poor talent management.  All too often highly skilled technical people are promoted into leadership positions , and they have no idea what they are doing and the team suffers.  there is also no consideration for compensation given to employees for their experience.  If you get hired this year at a set salary, it does not have a cost of living increase.  Next year an identical person could be hired who would make more than you, even though they have less experience.  This is one of the major causes of employee attrition.  I can really only speak for IT but Mid-level management (director level) is just plain bad.  By every definition of the term, just poor leadership."

There is a renewed focus on it's greatest asset-- the people, and it really shows in how the company fosters a team atmosphere, continual training/learning opportunities, and dozens of employee-focused activities, benefits, perks, etc etc etc.  I left Cisco for a period of time, and after experiencing several other companies, how they treat employees, the culture differences, I can honestly say that Cisco is by far the best company I have ever worked for. It is fast paced, and if you are not a ""high performer"" it can be a challenge, because the people here are incredibly intelligent and competitive... just dive right in and learn to swim!","The fast paced nature of the business can be overwhelming sometimes, but if you embrace it and work smart, with continual learning built into your career plan, then the sky is the limit. Life is about choices, and because of the collaborative, ""always on"" nature of the network, you must learn to unplug from work to keep your life in balance--- otherwise you start ""living to work"" instead of ""working to live"".  You have to manage YOUR career and calendar, otherwise the aggressive, success-driven nature of Cisco will ""eat you for lunch""."

We also have five days paid time off each year (in addition to our regular vacation time)  to serve our communities through the charity of our choice.  In my experience there is very little micro-management, the people are great to work with, and it is a very diverse work culture.

The good thing is that if you ever get bored with a certain role, you can always switch to a new team. That makes work always challenging, and when it's challenging, it's interesting. The downside is that most of the work going on is on proprietary technologies, (in may area atleast) so it may not be helpful when switching companies.","It's a big company so you may get lost. I'm ambitious, and in such a big company, it's not easy to get to the top. 
It's also, frankly, boring. Not because of the work, but because of the environment. They have ancient drab grey cubicles, which is just off-putting to a lot of millennials in the tech industry who are used to interesting office spaces, creative and challenging environments, and good food.
Lastly, there need to be more promotions and rewards. It's common to see people leaving even though they like their job, simply because if they didn't they wouldn't progress in their career. There are slackers, and there are over-acheivers, and there needs to be a better mechanism to identify them."

Great work experience.","While the culture is improving, it still has many challenges.  Way too many people that are in leadership positions that shouldn't be. They think that bullying their employees is fine as long as they can effectively suck up to senior management.   Lots of implicit bias in the organization, and women definitely suffer from the classic double-bind:  if you are decisive you aren't likable, and it stalls your growth.   Continual churn of executives creates whiplash in employees, as a new executives come in with new plans, throw the baby out with the bath water, and then move on when they figure out there ideas aren't so great after all.

It's important to speak with current or recent employees connected to the hiring department to make sure you fully understand what you're getting into.   And I'm sure Cisco isn't unique in that they don't always provide enough budget to adequately fund certain expansion initiatives. The expected results are made crystal clear, but enough resources to achieve it may not be provided.

Being a part of a small group makes it feel homey and easy to settle into. Being a remote office, and also an integral part of the security effort, we are shielded from the greater movements within Cisco with respect to business reorganizations, workforce reductions, etc.

It's a blank canvas, if you would like to achieve something special here, it is possible. Of course, if you would like to slowly wilt here, that is sadly also possible.

On the corporate side of things, l feel that upper management did the right thing by calling a preemptive layoff in 2013. They saw the writing on the wall and didn't hesitate, although, they could have reorged better; cutting 4000 and then immediately hiring 500 for new disruptive businesses is an incredible waste of talent and acquisition dollars.

We're a buzzword factory!","At a remote site, small-office politics reign. 

Career advancement is almost non-existent. There are no career paths/development plans to speak of.  Cronyism runs rampant during the stagnant periods, which is to say, most of the time. Salaries are less than you would find on the east coast; not at all comparable to the left coast. Bonuses are necessary to make the compensation acceptable, but each year it's a crapshoot whether you will get them or not. Employees will advance faster by leaving the company and returning later."
Service operations manager,4.0,"Jun 9, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","Industry leader for 20+ years, Cisco manages to re-invent itself during market transitions, leaving competitors in the dust. Plenty of challenging work, you're surrounded by strong talent willing to collaborate in cross-functional projects to achieve goals. The complete compensation package & benefits seem better than industry average. Cisco manages finances as I do: Being frugal and debt free. The company has an enormous amount of cash available to survive tough times and take advantage of acquisition opportunities.","More political and more turf wars than it used to be. Still a good place compared to other companies though. No job security, more layoffs than similar companies - that's the price you pay for being a large company that must move fast through market transitions.

The campus is huge and there are lots of jobs available. The transportation shuttle between buildings is a great gas-saver. Liked being able to telecommute and have a flexible work schedule. Enjoyed attending the all hands meetings hosted by John Chambers, he is a good speaker and the sessions were entertaining and informative. Cisco has great giveaways to new employees. Free onsite perks like free drinks and popcorn. Nice cafeteria facilities with good selections and reasonable prices. I liked that I could do my personal banking, stationery, and shipping at Cisco too.","Large employer; can get lost as a little fish in a huge ocean; lots of autonomy and self management expected. Had to find my own chair, computer, desk equipment on my first day - not a great first impression for a new employee. Moved 10 times in 2 years - don't get used to a place or ""home"", you'll be losing it soon. Management expectations not always clearly communicated. Feedback not always timely or direct. The only constant is change. Work not evenly distributed - some working ridiculous hours and some not hardly working at all. Perception is everything, isn't it?"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 13, 2018","Former employee, more than 5 years","Excellent campus, at least at Cessna in Bangalore.

Excellent cab facility, though the charges that contractors have to pay to avail the facility is exorbitant.
Unlimited Work-From-Home options, flexibility to arrive and leave from office any time that suits you. 
Reimbursement of broadband expense, good insurance coverage including parents, spouse and children.
Absolutely no dress-code, you can wear anything you feel like including shorts.","Major re-structuring and consequent layoffs practically every quarter in all locations and all BUs (and an annual big one around Diwali/Oct-Nov time-frame).
Exceptionally top-heavy organization where hardly any work gets done. If you are politically connected well, you will stay otherwise prepare to get fired.
Useless long-timers as managers, who keep firing people based on their likes and dislikes of people.
Dis-proportionately large numbers of Contractors as compared to FTEs (at least in Services/CX) which shows the lack of any long-term vision.
Marked discrimination between FTEs and Contractors in terms of treatment meted out (I was an FTE, so its not a disgruntled Contractor ranting).
Absolutely no touch with HRs, they only interact with you on the day of your on-boarding and thereafter only when you raise a case which will be responded soon enough. Beyond that, no interaction, to the extent that there is no Exit Interview either when you resign.
No onsite, at least none in IT.
No hikes every alternate year. And promotions are next to impossible, and even if you do get promoted do not expect any increment in package.

Product manager,1.0,"Nov 21, 2022","Former employee, more than 5 years","- Cisco has a great reputation as the industry leader in a lot of areas, particularly networking hardware and datacenter equipment, thus working at Cisco obviously is a good addition to your resume. (However the Cisco reputation is not the same as it used to be) - The offices are pretty amazing with state of the art facilities. You do not get much time to use these facilities though. But they're there. We had a mini cinema hall in the Bangalore office. It doesn't get any better than that. - Work from home option, in some teams, is quite flexible. - A well connected pickup and dropoff cab service in the Bangalore office (Not free, but costs about Rs. 2000 per month)","Where to begin - There is zero involvement from HR whatsoever. If your director/manager is exploiting you, which by the way is extremely common, you have no one to help you. Only your teammates, who are probably also being exploited. - You are completely at the mercy of your direct and second level bosses. If your team is toxic (my experience), you will suffer a lot. In the many years I have been in Cisco Bangalore, I have seen so many people in a similar situation as me. Helpless, with the only option to look outside Cisco for work. - There is no work-life balance whatsoever. If you have a geolocated team, you are expected to be available for work/meetings in all timezones. 'Night meetings' are ubiquitous and you are expected to work on weekends too. - Layoffs are so frequent that even before the upcoming layoff occurs, rumors of the next layoff are commonplace. Who is going to be laid off doesn't matter at all on the person's merit or capability, but on the relationship they have with their manager and director. - Promotion cycles get cancelled very frequently. Bonuses are more or less always meagre, with a company factor, usually below 100%, which means you get a lower bonus than your bonus target just because the overall company is always under performing. - The CEO is an ex-sales VP, who's only focussed on profits. Since Cisco is losing market share and yearly revenues are always less than $50bn, Chuck Robbins' method for maintaining profits and consequently dividends is to hire execs with the mission to lay off a huge chunk of their teams in the so called 'streamlining' initiatives. All you hear in Cisco is layoffs. - Cisco's policy of internally promoting managers based on years of service rather than capability has filled Cisco's ranks of managers with incompetant managers (and even directors) who are more suited for tech lead or project management positions. They lack vision and foresight, and are only focussed on the present. Something I feel resonates all the way to the top with Chuck Robbins and his team in many regards. - The pay, in comparison to comparable roles in comparable companies, is always low. There is huge attrition which leads to lots of instability. It's been a tremendous challenge planning projects since teams are always transient. - The hiring process for Cisco is to hire people cheap who will be able to 'do the job' rather than 'invent new products'. Getting hired by Cisco is no longer a big deal. Thus there is a huge upsurge of converting red badge employees, who are from vendor companies, to blue badge full Cisco employees. This ensures the business is run... but not changed. Cisco loses innovation and invention, and consequently its leading edge. This problem is spread across almost all teams. - There are so many layers between you and the customer, that you will probably never get the opportunity to talk to a customer directly. Which basically means you slowly lose knowledge of what the market wants. Thus when you apply outside for a new role, you know what your manager/director wants, but not what the customers want."
Software engineer iii,4.0,"Feb 24, 2015",Current employee,"Cisco is fairly friendly to working from home (I do so at least once a week; we have quite a few full-time remote workers). While changing any large company is like turning a big ship, Cisco seems more nimble than most (I've worked at one other very large IT company, and Cisco is more nimble than that one, and generally a nicer place to work). Cisco really tries to be a great place to work. It doesn't always succeed at that, but is never worse than decent. Work/life balance is pretty good. I hear horror stories from people about the lack of that; I don't hear those at Cisco.","Bad coffee, infrequent raises, middle-of-the-road salary and benefits, and we've had a lot of rounds of layoffs in the last 5 years or so."

Business plans change on a whim, and good people lose jobs. 2-3 years down the line, you will pay the price for the shallow decisions taken today.
Your experience depends on which team you join. Beware if you get an offer from teams with higher percentage of Malayalees, specially women. Most of them are horrible co-workers, even if they are good at their work. They do mean and unprofessional things to bring others down and work hard to build an empire and bring more of their kind in.
Some managers are clueless, weak, promote favouritism and play people against each other. Some of them do not possess much technical knowledge and project themselves as ""people managers"". If you sense that your manager is harming your career prospects and not letting you develop in the areas that interest you, do not let it go. Leave, or try to remedy the situation smartly.
If you are not highly competitive and don't suck up to the right people, you will not survive here. You need to be tough, question everything, and trust no one.
Every few months, you will hear news of an employee committing suicide or dying of a heart attack."
Marketing,3.0,"Feb 2, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","Generally speaking people at Cisco are nice and respectful, especially compared to other high-tech companies where I've worked. They encourage and enable job and even entire career changes within the company, so there are lots of people who have been there 10+ years (which is a pro and a con actually). From my experience elsewhere I find they pay well, especially at the more junior levels, and the bonuses have been pretty healthy. Chuck is one of the most sincere CEO's in the Valley and deeply cares about doing good as a company.","The company is going through lots of change right now with an almost entirely new exec leadership team. They seem to be finding it hard to make decisions so important things seem to be stalled (especially in marketing). Chuck says he wants to move fast and faster yet, but we seem to be moving so sloooooooowly. It's excruciating. They also are pretty open about wanting to get rid of people at the more senior levels to bring in lots of young employees. And they want to reduce hiring in San Jose in favor of less expensive locations. So job security for senior people in San Jose is dicey. And finally, they're trying really hard to be cool and hip to bring in those younger people, but it verges on embarrassing how they go about it. Wearing jeans and doing video profiles called ""meet our millennials"" doesn't do it. It's well intended though!"

For those of you who have never heard of Cisco choice program, let me tell you what it is. When I signed my offer letter, I had to choose one of the five given start dates. When I came on the first day, I saw many other new hires like me who were hired as chooice hires. For the next one month, we were bombarded with information about the company and different Business Units within the company. After a month once we have all that information, all the choice new hires get to choose the BU, the team, the manager they want to work for.  Isn't this awesome???

 Cisco gives you an opportunity to work with so many different technologies, roles and flexibility to move around. The compensation is also good which adds to the reasons to work for Cisco.","The recognition and feedback system could be better. I would like to see some healthy feedback about my job from the upper management and a recoginition for the goals accomplished.

I have also heard ( haven't experienced yet) that there is always some politics involved when it comes to promotions, passing projects and things like that.

There is no customer interaction between the engineer who actually build a product and the customers who use the product. 

Cisco should also try to focus on the overall development of its employees rather than just the area he is currently working on..

Hardware engineering manager,2.0,"May 2, 2008",Current employee,"regular paycheck, industry standard.  Will not go away tomorrow.   The company is the network hardware standard.  When anyone is putting in network infrastructure, anything that will connect to the internet,  it will go through a Cisco Systems product at one point or another.  That means they company will last a few years,   so there will be consistent employment.   If you work hard enough to convince your boss you are worthy,  and you get a mediocre or better review on your yearly talent review?  you will get paid every other week.  This does not mean you are delivering quality work or innovation,  but you are playing the game well.

it is sad.  there is so much opportunity here.","innovation is out the window.  it is becoming process laden, and totally red tape encumbered.  Layoffs every time they need to make numbers.   Management heavy.

You want 100 words or more.  Hmm.  Why?  This is exactly the problem we are having at Cisco.  You set a rigid guideline, which requires people to fill up space, even when it does not have meaning?   We are experiencing the same here.  Why host a 1 hour meeting, when the point could be conveyed in 15 minutes.

Cisco used to be a highly innovative company, delivering cutting edge products.  Now?  we struggle to get 100 words,  instead of focusing on the product."
Technical leader i,2.0,"Sep 20, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","A standard set of benefits that work.  Good health insurance, life insurance and 401k benefits.  Most departments provide the opportunity for highly flexible hours.","Yearly lay-offs are draining morale.  Engineering is viewed as a cost center, so engineering is being marginalized by getting less of the bonus pot of money than some other areas in the corporation.  We're not sure where this will lead Cisco in the future as it has traditionally been based on technology advancement.  It might end up in very dark places for an engineer based in the USA.

The best benefits (restricted stock options, for example) are reserved for only the top 5 or 10% of employees.  This is stratifying the environment, and a culture of severe envy is building.  As an engineer, obtaining the top 5% can be counter intuitive.  Technical excellence helps, but political connections are most important.  This is anathema to a typical engineer.

As an engineer, the advancements of salary and title are now extremely limited.  The upside to this is most of the engineers achieve excellent work-life balance since there is little benefit to working too hard.

All of the above started changing sharply in 2008.  Before that, it was a very different story.  Many engineers are mourning the loss of a once great Cisco."

23 years later I still love to be in this company. changed 3 times organisation from IT, Sales to CX, took several jobs from Project Manager, to Regional IT Leader, Product Sales and Business Development. And hence, this is Cisco, you career depends entirely on your ambitious, you decide where you want to be.

The company changed over the years and yes, we intend to say, where are the great days, although I strongly believe Cisco has a great future in front of it.

But what I like most are the people, I made friends, and yes you can have friends at work, all over the globe. Another great thing of working for a global company. We are really One Cisco.

And hence the perks are great, there is always better somewhere else, although the combination of general benefits together with social responsibility programs like 5 days a year to do volunteering, that makes you want to stay for a company","Ok, not everything is great, like in any other company. Like we intend to be a virtual organization, it's has it's risk for disconnect with your peers. Yes, there video and we meet once or twice a year, you have to work on building your networks, staying connected ""from a human perspective"".

Lots of locations worldwide, wide variety of software and hardware positions. Flexible work hours, telecommuting, easy to stay connected 24 x 7. Highly educated workforce, lots of very smart people to hang out with and learn from. Market leader in many many categories. Free popcorn and drinks. Engineers have access to state of the art computers, labs and networks, and access to some of the biggest customers in the world, you wouldn't have this level acceptance working for a startup or a mid-level company.","It is a large company. 2001 brought some tough downsizing but there are still a lot of people failing to live up to their potential. This is mostly due to incompetent middle management on average, folks who have gotten promoted because they've stuck around for a long time and will put up with the crap that goes on with politics and maneuvering. No more HR department, the first and second level managers are expected to ""do it all"", lead the way, set the example and motivate and train as well as be de facto technical leads and pollinate projects across groups and locations."
Sales,5.0,"Feb 14, 2011",Current employee,"The products are the best.  Sure, there is a lot of competition, but Webex is still the best.

The Boxborough office is top-notch.  There's a cafe, plenty of customer meeting space, recycling, lots of clothing/community fundraising, and a very nice gym (which I should use- they seem to have lots of classes like spin and yoga, etc).  

The coworkers are a good bunch of people- very team-like atmosphere.  There isn't really anyone I don't ""like"" - there are lots of people with different interests, and they're all good people.

The management is strong as well- honest, straightforward, and experienced.  There have been people promoted in the last year or so, and that is good to see.

Sure, sometimes you don't agree with them, but when you find a job where you agree 100% of the time with your boss, I want to know about it.  The OD here is very experienced, and one of the smartest people I've ever worked for or with.

Overall company leadership is top-notch.  HR is extremely fair.  Employees are treated like adults.","It's in Boxborough.  Just kidding- but that's it.  Lots of us drive from New Hampshire or the North Shore, and it's a bit of a hike.  Some people work out of Boston, which is good if you live further south.

- Executive leadership you can respect. 
- Good starting salaries, generous cash bonuses, good ESPP.
- Stability, many employees make a career of working here through retirement; unique in this field.
- By far the most accepting work environment for employees of diverse backgrounds; in my personal experience (comparing to Microsoft, Bank of America, Intel, Government, and some smaller techs.).","- Benefits are weak.  Insurance portion you pay is higher than other are companies. No sick days.
- Unlike most techs, stock awards and options are limited to a select few high-level folks.
- 70's sweatshop work environment: cubicles, no offices.  Bad for engineering; maybe ok for...??
- Infrastructure is clunky.  Patchwork of Oracle/Unix stuff from the '90, inefficient internal tools.
- Cisco IT sucks (sounds mean, but I'm understating.)  Product teams outsource for reliable IT.
- Promotion path is fuzzy, many employees give up in frustration and advance through leaving.
- 4 weeks PTO sounds good, but they force to use one for annual company shut-down, so it's really only 3.  And, you get no sick days, so people tend to work when ill rather than blow the family vacation, which in turn infects more people.  (Contrast with 2 sick weeks, all holidays, plus 5 weeks vacation for senior people at Microsoft and other companies.)"
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Aug 11, 2016",Current employee,"I have had a great experience starting my career at Cisco. The people I work with are friendly and always willing to answer questions, and it's great to learn from a very smart, hard working group of people. 

The compensation and benefits are beyond anything I could have asked for:
The on-site health care and fitness center are exceptional and are much less expensive than any outside vendor. 
Employees have the opportunity to earn up to an additional $800 just for logging healthy lifestyle choices too; which can be used towards any health related expenses. 
401k matching is competitive, and employee stock options are also attractive. 
The most important benefit to me is the flexibility. I work from home most days and people trust me to get my work done. Although some people have meetings early morning/late night, people are allowed to schedule their day in a way to accommodate it (mid-day appointments, taking a long lunch to go to the gym, etc.)

There are also many employee groups to take advantage of such as Connected Women, Early Career Network, and Pride. It's a great way to meet people with your same interests.","Many of the office spaces are outdated...aka cubicles. If I had to go into the office everyday for 8 hours, this would be a complaint.

Software engineer iv,3.0,"May 30, 2011",Current employee,"I have no doubt there are some good groups in Cisco. The key is to get hired into just those where politics is at a minimum and there is more focus on the engineering itself. Now pray you are not involuntarily transferred to some other group due to a reorg.
Working from home is not a problem and they have very flexible work hours as long as one is delivering. The work can be interesting.","When I started in cisco a long time ago, it was a really fun place to work. We used to be busy with actual technical projects and customer driven features that actually made sense. My peers and manager were also good, and more focused on the technical aspects than on just getting ahead in the hierarchy. Re-orgs are an integral part of cisco and I soon found myself in less than ideal company. Ended up working for worse and worse managers. There were many cliques which managers seemed to encourage. if you did the technical work expected of you and did not question the order, you were ok. In the end, visibility, how you managed upward and politicking worked much better than actually doing the engineering work well.  We sometimes buy equipment for the labs just so the budget doesn't go to waste, the equipment  lies in the labs unused.
Talkers are preferred over doers. Peers/leads were more interested in looking good (i.e. not being contradicted) than actually making good technical decisions."

When a group fails at a project the leadership moves to another group and the engineers are laid off.   Way to many VPs Directors and managers.   There are managers with only one or two people under them.   Same with Directors and VPs.   Cisco has lost its focus and the Senior Leadership team is driving the ship into the icebergs.  Pay raises and promotions are only available to the managers and above.   Cisco considers it an insult to give a 2% pay raise to cover cost of living, so they may give you 5% every 5 or 6 years.

Being in sales, Cisco is known for the sales pressure. So you got to be thick skinned. Some may buckle while some rise. That’s the nature. A bit of luck is also important ;)
Work life balance for sales folks isn’t exactly 9-5pm. (While no one questions but there is an unsaid maturity that you need to get the work done).
From compensation standpoint I think some of the FANGs are doing better. Though I won’t complain 
It isn’t the most coolest or the gen-z kinda company. So comparing to a start up or young companies would be wrong, especially in sales. Can’t comment for software engineers

New benefit offerings also speak volumes about how they care for the whole employee - longer paid bonding leaves for parents and grandparents, flexible emergency time off policy that each manager can tailor to meet their employee's needs, Time2Give which provides a full extra week of paid time off per calendar year to volunteer for a non-profit or educational institution of the employee's choice (above and beyond any team volunteering and give back events).","Cisco did not act quickly enough to shift its business model when AWS and other cloud vendors became threats.  Now we are playing catch-up.  Don't get me wrong, we have ALL the resources needed to win the catch-up game: cash on hand,  transformation strategy, excellent CFO explaining it to the street, excellent people...   

But we have some things that could drag us down:  sheer size (lack of agility),  continued success in high-margin core business (hard to decide to cannibalize yourself), high-level leaders who have been around too long, have too internal a view, little outside experience and who have succeeded too long in the old way to be willing to jump quickly to innovative strategies or new business models."

- Work life balance with commendable initiatives like wellness days off, vaccination drives and awareness sessions","- Lack of career growth. No hikes, promotions or Risus for years. Except for the chosen few. No transparency on how to progress in career.
- Constant reorgs and layoffs bringing down employee morale. Management is clueless on what works and what does not. Statements which are designed to garner positive PR does not constitute a strategy at a tech company.
- Discrimination against Indian employees. Gaslighting of Indian employees by saying what they are making now is what they are worth. Being asked to work 12-14 hours with tight deadlines whereas American colleagues go on vacations, get goodies and seem to have relaxed working hours. Lack of RSUs for Indian employees. Different grade standards - Grade 10 job posting requires atleast 12 years experience in India whereas a similar one in US might have 3-5 years as a criteria.
- Tone deaf attitude of management. HR chief laughing during layoff announcement, constantly referring to the delta variant as Indian variant, talking about promotions and business trips for leadership team whereas majority haven't recieved even a inflation correction hike. Instances are too many to list down."

Director of marketing,4.0,"Dec 28, 2008",Current employee,Cisco is a well oiled machine.  It has great support systems and if you like stability you will get on fine.  If you are aggressive you will always have the opportunity to build a good niche and possibly a great team that will give you much satisfaction.   But it won't be handed to you - you need to use your social networking skills to create the opportunity.,"The sheer size makes if inefficient.  If you come from the startup world that will wear on you after a while.  

One should stay at Cisco no more than 4 years in the same job.  If you try and go external (to startups) you will be viewed as inflexible and some significant skepticism.  This isn't always the case, but it is common to see people doing the same thing, getting stale and suddenly (maybe being pushed) to ""see what is out there."""
Project team lead,3.0,"Feb 20, 2014",Former employee,"Cisco is one of those companies that can tell you what is going to happen in 10 years.
The (sometimes tough) directions the company is taking is showing a great sense of decision-making, strategies and insight.

As for the employees they are given the best care, best tools, the best hardware, the best trainings I've seen so far in my career.","Most employees are now hired through acquisitions. That was my case.
It is a good thing in itself, but this is a real problem for the company culture, meant to be open, collaborative and turned towards the future, when former managers looking at surviving the next week come into play.

You end up in a very interesting situation where the middle management is essentially anti-productive:
- very short term thinking
- no decision making, seeking ""consensus"" (which essentially means hiding until you can't hide anymore)
- focused on personal career, not on the team development.
In this environment, blame and backstabbing are very common, and not surprisingly talents get discouraged, or leave.

I personally loved my job and Cisco, and got caught in the middle of a management lack of decision, rendering months of hard work into dust, where a simple professional discussion could have solved the matter."

They have no culture of innovation or risk taking. The development team is just focused on short term gains.  As an engineer I was bored out of my mind porting crappy work from other divisions that were favored even though more than once we have developed a better solution.  Five years later they relented and let us rework that project to produce better reliability.  But it was after the issues that caused them to lose customers.  I worked in a BU that was managed by one culture and unless you went to the same temple and were part of that dynasty you were passed up for promotions and good projects.  They cleaned up some house since 2009 but the same issues take place that I discussed earlier.  I can tell the issues I raised still remain to this day when I interview unhappy Cisco engineers that sound defeated and frustrated and want to work elsewhere.

My sign should have been when we could not attract college grads to join.  I have to say I learned very little as a development engineer in the 10+ years I worked there.  I did learn a lot about networking however."

The answer to any situation in any climate is to cut headcount. We're making money? Layoffs!  We're losing money? Layoffs!  Stagnant?  It doesn't matter!  That might be easier to understand if we didn't constantly buy companies like they're on the candy rack next to the cashier at the supermarket.  (Seriously, we average about one acquisition a month.)

Also, Cisco tends to award bonuses as part of its compensation package instead of pay raises. The amount is roughly equivalent to the amount you might get as a pay raise elsewhere, but pay raises compound over time, where bonuses do not."
Senior hardware engineer,4.0,"Sep 29, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","It's a large company, so there's not a lot of opportunity to change the world in engineering, but there is plenty for changing your career through parallel roles, management positions, and training.  Of course the work is completely flexible with little travel, so the day-to-day can be very predictable.  They really make it ""comfortable"" for every employee, if you want two monitors, a separate chair, late working hours, and a predictable annual review, then it's a not going to be problem.  That's great if you're looking for just this.","Cisco gets all it's innovations through acquisitions (or so upper management believes), so there's not a lot of risk taken within the company to do so.  Therefore, any mature technologies are in sustaining cost-cutting mode.  That means lab budgets are reduced, annual lay offs are common, and the cube space is downsized towards open environments.  If you just work to get your work done, this is okay, but if you want your work to be fun and exciting, this is a serious downer.  That's why there are fewer young people applying."
It engineer,3.0,"Oct 28, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years",A truly flexible work life balance that most leadership and employees emulate and practice in.  This can be a great benefit for those that are more mature in their life and require the flexibility or just need the ability to take care of errands and tasks without being bound to work hours.,"Cisco under pays their IT staff which is predominantly made up of contractors (over half).  It's as if Cisco believes it's still in its early 2000 heydays hiring cheaper contractors to manage their ever-growing supply of products and software services that never achieve a respectable integration.  Any engineer worth their salt would immediately turn away from the lack of respect in their woefully below market pay for IT Engineers while asking for the cream of the crop.  The greed is evident in their low base salary for the position to accommodate for their loose definition of what they constitute as an IT Engineer.  Yet, they will still have the gall to go recruit for quality engineers with the position and continue to be surprised when they lose recruit after recruit to their more informed competitors."

Director,5.0,"Dec 27, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is very much a meritocracy -- where folks are empowered to be innovative and provide leadership, vision, and join in strategic direction of the company.  Folks who succeed here need to be self-starters, and Cisco rewards such performers with many opportunities to work in many different functional areas of the company.   Cisco's culture is one that has no pre-conceived notions of social status, or placing value on where people went to college or received their MBA degrees.   From my experience, the best managers and leaders who get promoted are those who delivered the goods, or stepped up and led others.   

In my long tenure at Cisco, I've been given many different jobs and roles, and it's that on-going commitment from Cisco to aid me in my learning and career development, that makes this such a great place to work.","People who ""ask for the ball"" are given it, and Cisco rewards such performers.

Senior finance manager,5.0,"Feb 23, 2012",Current employee,"Speaking from a finance org. perpsective, those rotational opportunities can be abroad, to completely different functions and even into a completely different org.

Certainly not a place for someone who wants to cruise. There is the everpresent corporate ""shmooze game"" here to move up the ladder but I feel that career advancement opportunities here are still more merit based than in other Fortune 500 companies I've worked at. You can make a huge impact in big dollar impacting processes even if you're a jr. analyst.","Based on HR's ivory tower benchmarking of total compensation, Cisco is competitive in the industry. But I'd say it's far from a leader given the flight we've seen in talent to both competitors and all the hot names in tech right now. Proof is in the pudding. No ""little perks to show we care"" here like free meals and the like. People are still seething over the loss of free sodas and juice from a couple three years back.

Strong mentoring - employees wishing to go the extra mile to help and guide colleagues","Frequent lay-offs - often told things cannot happen due to layoffs, which have happened almost every year since 2009. Creates a negative culture of fear.
Untrustworthy senior management - related to the layoffs
Unclear employee metrics - SEs and related roles are purely at the mercy of their manager when it comes to performance reviews, which in turn directly affects promotion prospects, pay rises and so on.
Questionable hiring choices - lots of new ""SE 1"" roles being hired instead of the more common SE 2-3. This lack of experience causes resourcing and customer perception issues.
Shouters rewarded - those who make themselves visible and 'shout the loudest' are most likely to receive rewards, recognition and promotion"

One that I am proud to have been a part of.","Constant reorganisations and product changes can be quite dizzying. But this is what makes the company so successful.

Career progression can be difficult in such a large organisation that has very low attrition. Especially when stuck in a niche industry or speciality.

The company attitude is very USA-centric. If reporting directly into a USA group, there will be very little understanding or respect for cultural values outside of their domain. This is challenging.

This translates to a mountain of bureaucracy, with hundreds of internal groups, some deeply removed from customers.  The group I worked for went by an acronym, and no one, not even my manager who had been there for 20 years, could recount what the acronym meant or how they came to get it exactly.

Cisco seems to have an existing informal agreement with employees: we will hire you as a contractor, and one day, many years from now, you will become permanent.  May be 2 years, may be 5.  That's a long time for commitment in the tech sector, so it attracts folks who are willing to slog it out and are looking for long-term, safe employment.

A newer model was developing as I was leaving, which is diametrically opposed to this, was outsourcing.  So after toughing it out for years and doubling-down on Cisco, you might discover that one day a foreign employee on a visa, or many, many foreign employees with visas suddenly appear.  It's your job to train them in how to do your job.  Sound scary?  It sure was to the 55 year olds I worked with."
Marketing executive,3.0,"Aug 1, 2016","Former employee, more than 5 years","Cisco the company is solid. Generally nice working conditions, perks, compensation, programs. 

The company, though, is growing very very slowly (5% would be a strong year), and not always in the hottest fastest-growth areas (cloud, security). So, it grows primarily through acquisition of other companies to bolster lackluster organic expansion. 

It's a bit like working at a utility company. Nothing too exciting. Shallow dips and small peaks; nothing to write home about. Nothing earth-shattering or particularly innovative on its own, so it acquires growth. In order to maintain steady headcount, layoffs are frequent and predictable.","As with most larger companies, there are departments and programs that are run well, and some to avoid.  

The Marketing & Communications team is an unmitigated disaster. Since a new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) was appointed in mid-2015, there have been at least six layoffs of varying sizes in Marketing alone, with more always on the horizon. Marketing leadership has been decimated in a purge to remove anyone who might not be loyal to the latest CMO and her hatchet-man.  VPs, Directors, Managers, and Individual Contributors are all whacked -- and as usual, the best people have left.

Steer clear of Cisco Marketing, but otherwise the company is pretty good although slow-moving and middle of the road."

Frugality is crazy for one of the biggest and most profitable companies in the world - e.g. soda and fruit removed from staff.  No free gym for example which other large companies provide for free.  Raises few and far between and too few promotions, especially for technical staff.  Lost its way on Routing and switching but thank goodness this has been recognized and resources refocused.  Training for such an innovative company amounts to little more than ""read about it on the intranet or internal webexs that are always business focused.  Training is what others do, not Cisco employees...  You could work 24x7 and no-one would know, or care.  ""Visibility"" is the key word at Cisco.  If what you do is not visible to others you'll get no-where.  Bring people in from outside on much higher salary and do not promote from within, even those who have developed significantly.  Lost the focus of a start-up and too much emphasis on the CIO conversation.
All these things are correctable but they need to make rapid progress since able technical staff are drifting away from Cisco."
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Apr 2, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years",Stable company with decent benefits.,"I've been with Cisco well over 10 years and have seen the environment get worse and worse.  Many of the comments here are flat out WRONG if you are in development (at least in my group).  

Cisco is rolling out Agile, but in a non-sensical manner.  Worst of all, they have manipulated / misrepresented this Agile adoption to the rest of the company.  As a result, this dysfunctional version of Agile is being adopted in other groups as well.

- Work/life balance is paid lip service, but is NOT a priority.  The Agile construct gives them an excuse to try and get people to work extra hours on a consistent basis.

- Work from home is not encouraged in my group, nor even allowed for most people.  This seems strange coming from Cisco that creates infrastructure encouraging such an environment.  Note again, this is a by-product of the dysfunctional Agile, and does not apply to all groups.

- Compensation is mediocre at best, though as mentioned, at least you don't worry about your paycheck bouncing.

- Cisco has mandatory PTO over the holidays every year.  So while on paper, you get 4 weeks PTO, in reality you lose nearly a full week to the mandatory shutdown.  This is one of the cheesiest moves I've seen a company make.


In a nutshell, if you are applying for a position at Cisco, and they tell you they are Agile... Just walk away."

Network engineer,2.0,"Jun 14, 2010",Current employee,Pay is enough to make a living if needed (although barely). It's fun working with new and exciting protects and technology.,"Cisco used to be the place to work. It was a company once plagued with brilliant and talented engineers. Even so, the company and management would go out of the way to make sure one was compensated for hard work, brilliant ideas, game-changing strategies, and good 'ole focused and hard work.

Now? Don't hold your breathe.

Moving up in the company (not necessarily into management positions, but rather getting promoted and raises) is impossible. I had a conversation recently with an HR rep only to have her admit during the course of our discussion that the only way to get a decent raise at Cisco is to leave the company and then come back later.

I'm looking forward to leaving Cisco and finding a company that has more growth potential -- a place that values its employees and cares about their livelihoods. Cisco used to be a fun, energetic and exciting company to work for (a lot like Google). Now it's just another bureaucratic jungle with little room for employee satisfaction."
Technical leader,2.0,"Jan 19, 2012",Former employee,"Co-workers were great. Very little in the way of office politics among non-managerial co-workers. Work environment was excellent, and I generally had all the equipment I needed. Salary was the on the high end. If you're fortunate to land in a group doing new development and be assigned that work, then the work can be very exciting.","In the video group I was in, the low level management was in constant flux, so there was no loyalty to direct reports. Sometimes as many as 3 managers telling a team of 2 engineers what to do. While there was a high level of technical skill and work ethic among managers, their managerial people skills were terrible. Software engineers treated more as cogs than people. Large influx of contractors added to this feeling. John Chambers preaches the ""Cisco is family"" ethic... I saw no evidence of it here. While I had occasional times of good work, most of work was boring... fixing or triaging bugs mainly. I know a co-worker still working there, one of the sharpest engineers I know, have his project cancelled. He's now talking of leaving in a couple of years. When I was there, the video group was constantly being reorganized. There is some opportunity to move around, but you're just as likely to get stuck in a dead-end job. I was very happy to leave this company."
Account manager,5.0,"Aug 7, 2018","Current employee, more than 3 years","Cisco is a very good company to work for. 

There are countless smart people around that are willing to help. It’s an innovative company in either acquisition or development which means you’ll never be bored, plus we have excellent portals and content for learning.

You need to acknowledge the days dedicated to “giving back” i.e 5 days for you to spend doing your chosen charity work. There is great flexible working and amazing tools that help make that easy.

It’s a company lots of people feel proud to work for and many people spend a number of years at. Plus I’ve seen a lot of people leave and then come back because Cisco really is one of the best companies to work for.","There are typical examples of inwardly focused management and intolerably lazy people but they can be avoided. My main wish is that it was easier to move around the world, you often hear that it’s very difficult to move countries which is disappointing given the company is so global."

If you expect that just doing good work and working hard will matter you will be disappointed. Making Excel spreadsheets and copying nearly everyone on an email is a far more useful skill.
-There's always a negativity from managers and false stress sent down from them. I had four different managers and even the best ones always seemed to be negative about something. I didn't realize this until I changed companies and realized just how much better the environment could be.  This must come from higher management because even the good managers were like this. My new job just doesn't have this nonsense.

Director,5.0,"Oct 7, 2018","Current employee, more than 10 years","I have worked at Cisco for over 20 years in development and services organization and it has been a fun ride. What I love about Cisco is that at its heart it is truly customer focused company. If what you are doing is right for our customers you don't need to be a ""somebody"" to make it happen.

As a woman there are two things that I really like about Cisco:
#1 - If you get results, you will be rewarded. I have had good career progression by working hard on important things.
#2 - Workplace flexibility, we have all the tools we need to work wherever and whenever we need to. This lets me work hard and balance being available to my family.

The other thing which I love, love, love about Cisco is its commitment to giving back. This is part of the DNA of the company from the beginning. I call it ""entrepreneurial CSR"" because the company just encourages us to ""go for it"" and follow our passions in giving back to our communities. We get 5 days volunteering per year which the Cisco foundation matches with a cash donation for every hour we volunteer.","Change - if you don't like change, this is not the right place for you.

Solutions consultant,3.0,"Feb 20, 2020","Current employee, more than 5 years","Telecommute, worked with global team colleagues, my team always had each other's back ALWAYS.","~45% of Cisco workers are ""contingent"" (contract); the majority should be full-time employees. Too many managers are way too political and are here for their own self gains even by stepping on employees who work for them, my level of trust with most managers was low; I will say I had 2 managers I would follow to the end of world (one was a Sr Director and one was a Sr Manager - fabulous, this was 6 years ago and they are now gone, they had 20 years at Cisco).  Some managers I questioned (to myself no one else) why they had their role and it was clear they had connections and were ""covered"". I've been in IT for over 25 years and Cisco is the worse I've ever seen. I have this love/hate relationship: 1) I need to telecommute (EXCELLENT) due to family; 2) Cisco treats employees as replaceable cogs (BAD) in a machine, raises may take 3-5 years to get one. Yeah, it's a right to work environment, this isn't Cuba. If I'm expected to be loyal and jump when they say jump, I expect management to do a better job of supporting their charges. Like I said, not all are bad, but too many, IMHO, are. I've been a manager and leader, and have always respected and supported my charges."

There are very many talented people working together to innovate and bring amazing products and services to the market.,"The tail wags the dog. Thousands of hours and millions of dollars are wasted every quarter as a result of cumbersome and antiquated code and a compensation system that actually rewards poorly performing sales teams for flipping deals and stealing commissions. On the one hand, we tell our partners to invest with us and trust us that we know where the market is headed. On the other hand, when the do exactly as directed, we do nothing to protect them when they place deals into our ordering system in good faith, only to find that it suited some sales guy to turn around and fulfill it some other way in order to make his quota."
Account manager - global service provider,5.0,"Aug 30, 2019","Current employee, more than 5 years","- The company culture is incredible (I can count on 1 hand the people I've met in 5 years that I haven't liked or thought weren't a good fit). 
- There are plenty of opportunities for movement within the company and most people are willing to help
- Amazing opportunities for early in career (I went through the CSAP ASR sales program and it has been a fast track into major account management)
-Company values the opinions and work of early in career (have had meetings w/ VP's who treat you as an equal)
- 401K, ESPP, travel (if desired), unlimited trainings (on both technology/career growth), team building/volunteer events,  intramural, etc.
- For a 70K person company, they do an amazing job keeping a family like feel
- Compensation for sales reps are above industry standards and AM's are typically goaled within reason.
- Work from home, own your own schedule, no micromanagement.","I have not had a bad experience in my 5 years at Cisco. This company has fast tracked my career and has given me the  flexibility to travel back home frequently to visit my family after a tragedy. 

Like any company or role, your manager controls your happiness and quality of day to day life and the bad managers at this company in sales are few and far between.

There are a small list of companies I'd ever consider leaving Cisco for and it would take quite the offer."

Integrated marketing communications manager,5.0,"Apr 25, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco offers tremendous career and growth opportunities and a very collaborative environment. John Chamber's strong leadership fosters innovation and is also reflected by Sr. Management. It is exciting to work for a company that has been financially stable and has been extremely successful and growing for the past decade. Cisco also employs some of the smartest people and working here offers the opportunity to meet them and widen one's own horizon. There are an unlimited number of ways to engage yourself in initiatives and programs either within or even outside the work environment such as Green Initiatives, Volunteer activities and other community services. In summary, I think Cisco is the very best place to work for in today's high-tech industry due to its technology and market leadership, innovation and strong brand.","Due to its collaborative environment, there are generally too many meetings one has to attend during the day which makes it challenging to find enough time to get the actual work done and being productive. In addition, Cisco is a workplace that requires constant availability through being always connected to email, IM, smartphones etc. which leads to an extremely high level of disruption. Decision making processes can take quite a while because so many people across all different organizations and theatres need to be involved. Another challenge is prioritization of projects as there are often too many for one person to handle."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"For what I do, I have reasonable deadlines and usually clearly defined goals. I'm rarely bored at my job.","When budgets are cut then you read what VPs make, it makes you wonder where all the money is going. I have to bust my butt for a few shares of stock while VPs routinely exercise HUNDREDS of thousands of shares of stock. The company says they're Web 2.0 savvy but they're really not. Hiring young talent is an issue. When all the execs wear 3-piece suits and drive fancy cars and expect you to dress like them when meeting with them, it's going to be a challenge to hire a bright young person who wants to wear shorts to work. Many of the executives don't blog or use new web technologies to do their jobs or live their lives. I think some of them have their heads too high up in the clouds. The buildings are atrocious; they're all tan and beige inside and out."
Account manager,4.0,"Feb 23, 2009",Current employee,"Stable market leader that is never satisfied with the status quo.  Their products are second to none, and they truly understand the value of products that compliment each other.  They use all their own products internally and that certainly lends credibilty in the sales process.  They have a very good benefits package and provide 4 weeks of vacation per year to new employees.","Work / Life balance is something that is talked about all the time, however it is very hard to achieve, especially at the end of each quarter.  Sales is a tough game with any company, however at Cisco your territory and your quota don't always align.  A brand new rep right out of their training program can achieve 115% of quota (with no true sales experience), while a seasoned individual can be ""worked out"" of the company depending upon the geographical piece of dirt each is given.    At the end of each fiscal year, accounts are shuffled and territories are re-aligned, which means unless you are a global account manager, you aren't going to be calling on the same customer more than 12 months.  Very hard to become a trusted advisor to a customer in this scenario."
Senior engineer,2.0,"Apr 16, 2009",Current employee,"Cisco offers the ability to gain exposure to many different technologies while working for a single company.  Pay and benefits are very good and while the workload is high, it is not ""startup"" hours for the most part.  Cisco can be many different companies depending on which group you are in or whether your programs are in favor or not.  High visibility programs, senior exec. sponsored initiatives can be good experiences, while other extremely important core business can feel very unappreciated.","Cisco continues to move jobs overseas despite being incredibly/ off the charts profitable.  Cisco has a globalization strategy to develop products for low cost geographies in those geographies and have access to global talent.  This strategy makes sense, but the way budgets are handled, the individual business units are simply shedding higher cost US jobs.  The way the businesses are rewarded and budgeted, it is all about headcount expense these days.  I really wish Cisco would show more integrity here and show a little loyalty to its workforce."
Consulting systems architect,4.0,"Nov 16, 2011",Current employee,"Great engineers and perhaps the best place to work if you are a network guy or IP guy. Information sharing within company is excellent and there will be dozens of people coming forward to share with you when you shout for help.
The single best aspect of benefits/work is flexible timings. No one asks you what time you are coming or going as long you deliver the results.
Training is wonderful and opportunities to learn are tremendous. Connecting & networking aspects are great if you are in the consulting or sales roles.","Single biggest problem is bureaucracy. you'd be surprised to see the amount of documentation required for ""internal processes"" and most of the times you spend time internally rather than externally. i.e. with Customer.
Top management is OK but the problem lies @ middle layer. most of the times they've their own agendas and its frustrating to manage the different agendas.
Work-life balance is quite bad as most of the time you're lost in the tons of emails, documents and ever lasting meetings/webex calls. If you happen to be in the technical sales then literally you work almost every day including weekends & public holidays due to the ""urgent requests"" from customers and AM's.
Heavy focus on USA makes things difficult for people working in rest of the regions too.."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Feb 6, 2018",Current employee,"- Opportunity to explore and learn a wide spectrum of technologies 
- You get to interact with several great engineers
- Excellent WPR services, be it Gym, Transport, Cafeteria, etc.
- Very responsive support system (IT, HR, etc)","- A lot of visionary top leaders have left the organization in last few years. The current top management is unable to connect with engineers. They lack vision, charisma and motivational skills and just know how to use whip and do some program management. Have absolutely no interest in building team dynamics or developing the career of engineers, and seem to be mainly focused on their own job security and progress.
- For an individual contributor, career becomes stagnant after around 10 years, unless you are in the ""good books"" of someone in the top. But this may not be specific to this organization but a common Indian thing. There are a lot of stringent criteria that will be used deny a promotion for an IC. However, in the management ladder, you could see mediocre folks getting promoted quickly and growing in the path just because they have some X number of people under them and are able to squeeze more work on less number of people, etc.
- Work life balance is not great, with several managers indirectly promoting working close to 24x7.  I am sure this sort of work culture would have considered as a strong violation of labor laws if it were in some European country. Again, this is not a Cisco specific thing, but a normal scenario in Indian IT industry."

When mistakes were made, they were acknowledged and treated as learning opportunities and individuals who genuinely work hard get recognized.  We have a great Inclusion & Diversity team and there are diverse leaders that help individual contributors gear up to bringing their whole selves to work. If it were not for the Employee Resource Organizations (EROs) / Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), working at Cisco would not feel impactful. I am grateful that we have an Inclusion & Diversity team and leaders that support the EROs so that leaders of the EROs can work to change the culture positively throughout Cisco.",Not all organizations / teams in Cisco are open to all diversities and do not promote inclusion & diversity. It is not easy to be an LGBT employee in certain groups at Cisco and bring your whole self to work for fear of being treated differently.  Cisco tends to be a follower in inclusion and diversity trends rather than a leader in trends when it comes LGBT employee needs.

Senior software engineer,3.0,"Oct 28, 2008",Current employee,"Cisco is an Industry Leader in so many categories. It  has a great brand name. There are immense learning opportunities. It may be a very good employer especially when starting out fresh in your career. The executive management does a very good job communicating to all employees the direction and strategy of the company.
There is a awesome benefits package with gymns and other health benefits. There are incentive programs to promote innovation and out of the box thinking. The company also supports employee development by reimbursing tuition fees. They also have a dedicated facility to train employees in various skills.","It appears to be an overcrowded place. It appears that the pie is too small and too many people are trying to get a piece of it. This creates lot of bad blood among employees. Employees are competing with each other and often conspiring against each other instead of working together as a team to stay ahead of competition from industry peers. The engineering management would get better results if they spent some time in people management.  While the company support career development initiatives, the opportunities are too few and rare even though you may have the skills needed for the job.  Engineering promotions below a certain level are not announced, but silently updated in the directory - doesn't help transparency."
Technical marketing engineer,1.0,"Apr 8, 2009",Current employee,"The best reason to work at Cisco is purely to get Cisco on your resume.  The company still garners respect from the name recognition.  It is also a great place to learn how big business works, with lots of management that does very little and if you are the little guy you will get to see what it is like to get dumped on all the time, which will let you develop techniques to deal with stress and overwork.  Any job at Cisco will teach you office politics and give you insight into how playing politics can help you get ahead in a big company.  These skill are invaluable if you are planning on working at large companies for most of your career.","You will not be compensated very well, you will not receive very good benefits, you will be forced to dealing with lots of change without any input into the decisions or how they will be implemented.  You are forced to deal with LOTS of management, including VPs that don't even have anyone that report to them.  Generally you will be at the mercy of the upper management and whatever benefits you have now will be slowly taken away, without you getting a say into how, why or when they will go away."
Program manager,3.0,"Jun 1, 2012","Former employee, more than 10 years","Freedom to think outside the box and bring creative solutions to problem resolutions. You will have the opportunity to expand your skil levels and work outside your defined job role as desired.  Due to the size, opportunity to change groups to broaden experience.  Definitely a great work experience, but do not stay in the same role, gain experience and then move on to enrich your resume. Do not stay too long if you have career goals.","Political beast - promotion is difficult unless you are adept at working the system.  Projects tend to be grossly underfunded and understaffed in some organizations, with unrealistic expectations.  Other organizations are well funded with budget, resources and adequate timelines. 

Management will push initiatives which will increase their political position and opportunity for the next promotion - not what is the best move for the company.  Leaders have lost vision - initiatives are created reactively, not proactively and tossed over the wall for implementation with little or no planning."
Engineering director,4.0,"Feb 13, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","Despite Cisco's revenue, product, and market challenges, it's still one of the best places to work.  Compensation, benefits, and rewards and recognition are top of the line compared to other companies of similar size, maturity, and industry.  Senior leadership is very communicative about strategy, company strengths and weaknesses, decisions, and goals.  Also, Cisco has been very effective in moving leadership around and slimming down the executive band to allow lower levels to grow and ensure the company doesn't get ""stuck"" in it's ways as some companies do by keeping senior leadership locked into roles (examples include changes in HR, IT, Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Engineering leadership over the last 5 years.","Cisco continues to be unclear and ineffective in expanding it's product and industry space.  High-end video, consumer products (Linksys and Scientific Atlanta acquisitions), Education and Health industry, etc. have been major investments that haven't moved Cisco's advancement in the industry successfully.  Data Center and Security products have been good moves, but more creative new industries haven't worked yet.  It's been hard to move Cisco from just the best routers and switches company in the world to a more futuristic service and product provider.
Also, it's been hard to attract and keep young talent (millenials) so new blood and true innovation is a bit difficult despite that Cisco has some of the most amazing technology, sales, and business development employees in the world."

- Great company to have on your resume.
- They offer fantastic work-life balance and flexible work options. I worked from home almost the entire time I was there and loved it. They provide the tools you need to work from anywhere.
- Excellent benefits; employee health insurance premiums are really low.
- They employ some incredibly smart people, and I believe that the new CEO is going to do great things.
- It's a fantastic company for engineers; they are the star employees.","- They have a difficult history of annual layoffs, and the dust is still settling with the new CEO in place and the changes he's making to the organization.
- Cisco is not generous with merit increases and promotions are difficult to come by.
- Cisco is a behemoth of a company. As such, processes for getting anything done are complex and slow.
- Don't expect a lot of handholding as you start your job. Cisco prides itself on being a ""self service"" company. That means you have to figure out how to get things done."
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Oct 16, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","There are a lot of business units in Cisco with a lot of projects, it's possible to move around to find team and project that suits one the best. Recently there is a lot of talk about AI and some teams are using it, others are exploring options. Benefits are good, four weeks of vacation, accrued PTO, not ""unlimited"" like in many companies, 4.5 % match on 401K contributions, bonus, better health insurance than many companies, ESPP - you can save up to 10% of salary to buy stock with at least 15% discount. Cisco gives the lowest price for last 2 years (on ESPP buy dates) minus 15%, nice. In most teams work/life balance is good. It's possible to work on really big projects and products that most of startups can't handle.","It's a huge company, so there is more ""paperwork"" than in startups, reporting hours spent, creating and closing user stories and tickets... Also, there are slackers, and for long time those people can go by with doing almost nothing just because they are friends with their manager. Cisco has quarterly layoffs, usually small, once a year, in September to November a big one. Regardless of how much you contribute you may be let go just because the business unit is not as profitable as some others."
Customer success specialist,4.0,"Sep 6, 2020","Current employee, less than 1 year","Cisco is a great company,with lots of flexibility , they appreciate your dedication and hard work , it empowers and give employees the freedom to deliver to their full potential. 
It is a company that is constantly looking for excellence. 
It is a great diverse place. 
Great work life balance.
We work on the newest technologies, with modern processes that help Cisco (and us as employees) to stay ahead of the curve!
Great environment and atmosphere to work.
They appreciate the change and willing to listen to any ideas.
Dealing with customers is always facilitated.
Working for customer adoption is one of the unique and amazing experience.
Cisco is always looking forward to deliver the best experience and technologies for its customers.
Cisco is always coping with the new management and new organizational architectures.","Most of the teams are dispersed over large geographical regions and you feel some how that you have weak connections even within your team.
There is no clear instructions to follow for your onboarding ,also there is no clear path for self or technical development.
It is very hard to fully comprehend all the teams and specializations as it is so many with lots of functions.
Technical labs is some how hard to find and setup and different labs is found for different teams.
Lots of information scattered all over the internal pages , community , spaces with no single source of truth and no a standard way to organize these materials and data.
No clear goals nor appraisal criteria.
Layoffs Due to economy are difficult."
Engineering technical leader,4.0,"Mar 4, 2021","Current employee, more than 10 years","I think we need to evaluate a company based on many fronts.

1. Continuous learning: Cisco invests a lot in employees' learning. There are a lot of training offerings (paid-free, instructor-led - virtual), which anyone can enroll and learn a new skill. We can apply these new skills in any POC project and showcase them in wider forums, and get them productized.

2. Multiple companies: Cisco can be treated as multiple companies under one roof. Employees have the option of testing different waters and settle in their choice. We plan our own future.

3. Tons of great ancillary options: Be it Gym, medical support, reasonable WFH, no-strict 9-5 regime, healthy food menu in the canteen, Cisco has it all.","Turning to the other side of the coin, Cisco has its own share of improvements to focus on. To start with:

1. Agility: Cisco is heavily banking on the brand and vast customer base. It has to move out of its comfort zone and play a vital role in the 'Innovation' area and be agile.

2. Pay: End of the day, paycheck matters too, nothing can compensate for that. It's widely known that Cisco is not a great paymaster. Time and again it was brought to management notice, but negligible improvements so far. The HR team has to innovate themselves on how to retain people, improve employee happiness index, and shed the legacy model of hikes and promotions."

Essentially you're up against everyone else within your pay grade for a promo. That can potentially be a lot of people you have to our maneuver for extra dosh.
- Cultural shift in recent years towards loud and brash ""sell, sell, sell"" model, away from raw engineering and capability, that arguably made Cisco what it is today. 
- Almost too large now for engineers to be taken seriously unless they are architects / systems engineers or very senior and even then that's probably giving those folk too much credit. 
- Can be political but so can every work place"
Systems engineering manager,5.0,"Aug 31, 2019","Current employee, more than 10 years","I started my career in the CSAP program, coming directly from University. From the beginning I had tremendous support and felt the positive vibe in the company. You are always encouraged and empowered to find own solutions. I have always felt an incredible amount of trust - which let you simply grow. But if you ask for help - there will always someone available to help.
The culture is very supportive - not only on the professional, but also on the private life. Being a mother myself it helps to have a home office and flexible working hours to balance family and Cisco. 
Cisco deeply cares about giving back - every employee gets additional 5 days annually for local giving back activities. It is so inspirational to get this opportunity.","This culture works probably not for everybody. You have to have a sense of purpose for yourself and drive your own projects. If you prefer to have a detailed description and predefined steps what you have to do - Cisco is probably not the right company for you. In order to be successful you have to be self motivated, creative and the courage to succeed. And since you are so empowered - it can also be difficult to limit yourself to healthy work hours. You will be encouraged to care for yourself naturally - nevertheless there is no ""clocking in / clocking out"", hence there is always something to do - and you need to be able to set yourself healthy limits."
Senior business architect,4.0,"Feb 25, 2021","Former employee, more than 10 years","Cisco is a forward-looking company, but execution does sometimes get wrapped around the axle of politics. Cisco manages to stay where it is through the occasional big technology breakthrough, like Encrypted Traffic Analytics and thanks to brand, heft, and the fact that no one ever got fired for buying Cisco. The company is making good progress now in their transformation from a products company to a software/subscriptions company. This is an amazing accomplishment that should be credited to Chuck Robbins and his management team. While John Chambers grew a behemoth from a strong up-and-comer, and was a wizard at integration of acquisitions (for the most part), but he could not make this transformation, though he'd tried for years. It's a company with a bright future in cloud and security.","Too many decisions are made because of the HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion), whether or not it's the right thing to do.

If you keep your head down, don't rock the boat, and don't think outside the box, you'll do fine.","Rewards & recognition are hard to come by - you have to work the political game well to get management recognition for your work.
Upward mobility is also very hard to achieve with entrenched employees and very little movement, other than horizontal.
You are judged not on how well you do your work, but on who you know and your political clout.
A very passive-aggressive workforce who will smile in your face and agree with you, then undermine you and not help - only unless it serves them in their political gain.
Employee Monsters are easily recognizable, but are allowed to wreak havoc because management avoids all possible conflict (see: passive-aggressive)

Virtual customer success manager,4.0,"Jan 3, 2018","Current employee, more than 1 year","- Great work-life balance, and very open culture between colleagues and various teams
- Everyone in the team is very supportive of each other, and always keen to share best practices and their own experiences
- Customer Success is a new team in Cisco, but we are seeing large support from the CEO and Sales Leaders as Cisco makes the shift to selling more recurring revenue solutions. This is definitely the fastest growing team; and possibly where there is good career growth!","A lot of KPIs that the management is pushing for in a bid to prove the value of the Customer Success team.  Cisco is a sales organization, so there is large pressure for creation of expand opportunities. Even though there is so much push to get those KPIs fulfilled, people on the ground are limited due to the strange way in which the expand opportunities are measured.  This is especially difficult in APJ region due to resistance from internal stakeholders. 

Everyone in the team came in very excited and motivated about Customer Success, but I am seeing some level of disillusionment and exhaustion to keep up with ever-changing performance measures, tools, new offers with little to no time to adjust, and high pressure from the managers.

Also experiencing ""growing pains"" with large number of new members in the team."

Consulting systems engineer,5.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"They trust you to get you job done with little supervision.  I can usually set the times I travel and develop my own pace of what I want to work on.  Usually I can set my schedule up to a month out and I will know what I'm working on.  Managers work with you to ensure that you are helping you and the bottom line of Cisco.

I also like the flexible hours and the allowance of working from my home.  Many times I will not get inspired until late at night and I will work in to the early morning.  As long as I meet my commitments for the next day, Cisco supports me working when I need to.","Little guidance on what it takes to get promoted to the next level.  Many companies have this problem where they have fuzzy guidance as to what it really takes to move up to the next level.  I think this is a problem for those that are task oriented (as that is one of the skills Cisco Hires).  If there were a specific matrix that helped guide people to where they want to be in 3-5 years and even 10 years out, then Cisco would have a world class system of retaining people as one would always know where one's career is going."
Software engineer iii,3.0,"Jun 16, 2008",Current employee,Cisco is a huge company and you can spend a career jumping from group to group every few years and never work on the same thing over again. Despite what a lot of the reviews here claim Cisco does pay what they should be paying. Some of the business units within Cisco treat their employees better than others and it would be wise to interview with more than one if you're considering a switch to Cisco.,Cisco is a huge company and you can spend a year drowning in bureaucracy and fighting for change within groups that refuse to do things any better than they ever have before. Some engineers at Cisco are incredibly smart whereas other engineers are incredibly dense. Cisco prefers quantity over quality not only in their employees but also in their products. Shipping a half-baked product on a silly schedule to meet some arbitrary marketing deadlines just seems wrong. No one at Cisco seems to care that their products have a terrible reputation and without the brand recognition no one would buy them. Cisco India (Bangalore) is definitely focused on keeping seats warm rather than building a quality engineering force.
Software engineer iv,4.0,"Aug 29, 2008",Current employee,"Good benefit, completive scalars, flexible working schedules.","Has all the problems that a big company has. The company tried to change this by introducing a CDO college new hire program, and hoping the fresh blood can give more momentum to Cisco. But the result is just the opposite as what it was designed for originally. At first the screening process of the CDO program is too easy. Lots of new hire coming through this program are very high paid without a matching quality. And once they are choosen by the CDO program, they are offered to free pick any group to work for within Cisco. A lots of managers love to get them, just because the first year budge if coming from the company, not the BU. And the following years, if you got more people, you got more budgets. But very often the team can not swallow this much new college grades and sometimes the group doesn’t even have much work for them to do at all. So many of them end up sitting around, and picking up the bad culture of Cisco quickly, This further ruins the culture at Cisco, as an indirect result of it many senior and well experienced people are leaving Cisco."
Systems engineer,5.0,"Aug 25, 2015","Current employee, more than 3 years","I have been with Cisco for 3 years and I believe overall that this is an outstanding company to work for. This is the first company I have worked for that actually recognizes, values and *compensates* you for hard work. And if you prove to management your value and contributions to the overall company, they will absolutely take care of you when it comes to things such as relocation, education, and schedule flexibility. Since collaboration technologies are a huge part of the business model, there are a lot of remote work options (i.e. work from home, road, etc.) - but this depends on your exact role in the company.","The dreaded ""work/life"" balance is probably the number one complaint across Cisco employees but it is what you make of it. I know plenty of people that work at Cisco and maintain a pretty close 8-5 work schedule and are highly productive; I know others that work seemingly all hours of the day and night. It's up to you, setting the level of expectation and how efficient you are. But it is extremely easy to get very wrapped up with work and leave little time for anything else."

Optical engineer,4.0,"Aug 5, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","- CISCO work culture is Open and inclusive.
Open: There are no barriers or inherent hierarchy that limits an employee from reaching out to peers or seniors. The culture encourages collaboration, learning and gives the employee a place to broaden their horizons in terms of theirs skills and knowledge.
Inclusive: CISCO believes in inclusive environment where everyone gets equal opportunity to grow and develop. It is not only inclusive in terms of people but also in terms of growth in recreational activities like sports and arts. It is quite difficult to find such a culture in other companies in India.
- Awesome benefits: The benefits provided by CISCO is by far the best that I have known. The benefits include Health coverage for Family (yourself, spouse, children and parents or in-laws). This is quite rare compared to other companies health benefits. Free GYM, periodic health checkups for yourself, family and parents. Extremely well maintained sports facilities for shuttle, cricket, volley ball and basketball and various others. It supports tuition fee refund for any education/course you take.
- Good Personal and Professional life balance: The work culture is flexible and allows the employee to maintain a balanced personal and professional life. Managers are very understanding and in general the management encourages the employee to ensure a good balance in work and personal life.",The hike and promotion cycle is fixed.

 - Clear limits are put in place to make sure that customers are fully supported when new products are introduced. I can't overstate how refreshing this was.","- Sales teams seem to be split into warring factions.

Everyone that wants to be a manager can become one. It doesn't matter if you'll be a good manager or not, if you want you just work your way out to it. And that's how you become a bad manager and end-up ruining a whole team :)

The problem is that we have lazy and poor managers, managing senior and high performing engineers.

By micro managing, tons of bureaucratic processes and lack of transparency makes the life of engineers frustrating and pretty damn boring.

But it's a matter of luck, I had one good manager, a so-so manager, and now a terrible manager, so good luck with that.

This lack of transparency and bureaucracy is making cisco lose the best talent to other top companies and competitors, but the guys in the top probably don't see that.

Well I like the company, I like the colleagues, but don't trust the management and specially my manager, that's why I'm looking to move out :)"

Was great until about 2003-4, but has slid downhill since.","Boxborough is full of dead wood. Most of the talented people have left or are itching to.
Zero balance between work and home life. It's 24/7 stress due to an oversized workload, undersized staff, and too many people who are mediocre at their jobs.
Fair or not, there's a perception from other locations that San Jose is full of people who get paid for doing very little. It's all who you know. For sure the company is dominated by the IOS group, none of whom seem to understand software developement.
Brain-dead stress on metrics is driving the company and leading to ridiculous behaviors...example: rating managers weekly on their bug counts, while concurrently outsourcing QA to a third party in India where workers performance is based on how many bugs they find: you can guess what happened.
Morale at Boxborough extremely low. Then corporate came up with the PULSE employee satisfaction survey and tied it back-door to managers' compensation. So now the managers are mad at the rank and file for being unhappy. I know one manager that actually made his people take the survey twice with an unsubtle threat that they'd better score ""happier"" next time."
Engineering manager,2.0,"Jan 6, 2015","Former employee, more than 8 years","Great benefits, very competitive salaries, wide range of directions available in a big company.  As a well established high-tech company Cisco attracts top talent with a great benefits package.  On the whole Cisco looks after its employees and provides good facilities.","Limited opportunity to innovate, corporate politics, demoralizing business model.  Being head-quartered in the USA, Cisco has a very American approach, and it is difficult to influence company direction or progress through the corporate ladder without spending time working in San Jose.  Working in the UK often means calls and conferences well into the evening, long hours, and a heavy impact on your personal-life.  The company acquires businesses with large market-shares and then implements cost savings, this results in missed opportunities to grow markets and innovate and a feeling of not being engaged with the market or end-customer."
Financial analyst - lift,5.0,"Oct 28, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","-The rotational aspect of the program is great in that you can experience 4 very different roles over the course of 2 years, which is great for trying to understand a company as large as Cisco. The variety of roles is clearly a plus as you are able to preference which areas interest you as you move throughout your time in the program.
-Generally, the expectations from your teams are within reason but provide a challenge at least in my experience. Learning is encouraged and mistakes are seen as an opportunity to grow rather than a reason for criticism.
-The program itself feels like a family of sorts that you can relate with people in the same boat as yourself early in career. This makes for a great support system and provides an automatic resource for general questions.","-Sometimes timing of role responsibilities and additional program expectations can overlap which can create a challenge; however, these are chances to exercise time management.
-Transitions can be a little tricky to manage due to turnover of roles (some new ones can be added and others) so some processes aren't as clearly defined. Generally business partners are understanding though and there's always help to get you up to speed."

Product manager,3.0,"Aug 14, 2008",Current employee,"WebEx is a SaaS leader - and has market leadership in web conferencing space. Lots of potential as SaaS model truly takes off. WebEx encourages rapid pace of innovation - and is somewhat gratifying to see things shape up without much of red tape. Most people are very talented. Ever since Cisco has bought WebEx, there is a marked increase in the quality of upper management - in terms of their ability to aim big and execute. Best thing about WebEx - you do not have to pay for Web meetings - and online meetings are so effective to bring together geographically distributed teams.","Lack of respect for people and their personal life, and lack of professionalism (Especially within the product organization). 
WebEx culture can be described as somewhat chaotic. Disagreements / criticisms are discouraged - and the culture encourages people to rally around the Kool-aid of their bosses. Work-life balance is way tilted towards work, and the management takes it for granted. As an organization, WebEx tries to achieve more at the cost of quality of the product, and the quality of the life of the people who build the product. There are still remnants of fiefdoms from pre-Cisco time.

Internally it can now be a very political environment where promotions and increases were awarded  to those who bought into empire building within business units and not people doing the real work essential to the success of the company. The focus on process and metrics is only effctive when everyone either agrees or is aware of the metric targets, without that it seems like evaluations are subjective and unfair. Anyone who had been managed out due to restructure is more likely to have been targeted for being more of a thinker than the management wants."

I had the pleasure of working in lots of new areas - emerging markets, emerging solutions - and the conversations we had with customers were very interesting. Solving unique problems for smart cities, connected health, education, workplace, etc. For the right role, I would consider working there again. Internal competitiveness at one time created a healthy let's get it done environment. Great collaboration tools that enable you to have really effective virtual meetings. ""Be the customer"" mentality - always having employees adopt new productivity enhancing tools. Telepresence rules!","Really political. Terrible gossip system. There used to be a mentor-y ""we're in it together' feeling. It changed to more of a make yourself look good at the expense of other people culture.  Lost sight of what matters for awhile. Too many company priorities (at one point, there were 50 top priorities!)  Victim of tech jargon. Lots of big words to sound grandiose, but it didn't make sense in the end.

Technical writer,2.0,"Jul 30, 2016",Former employee,"Good cafeterias -- with both healthy choices and not-so-much.
Some nice buildings, although the nicer buildings have smaller cubicles.","Cisco is an engineer-centric society, much to its own detriment.

Cisco had an HR department website instead of new-employee orientation.  Despite the steady stream of complaints from employees about the user hostility of the internal HR website, Cisco persisted in forcing its employees to rely on a highly unreliable internal HR website, much to the frustration of everyone involved.

Cisco management seemed hell-bent on working its employees days, nights, and weekends -- all the while chanting the Work-Life Balance buzzwords as hypocritical propaganda.

Other companies work hard to instill and encourage and maintain mutual respect so that each and every employee, from board room to mail room engage with kindness and respect.  Not Cisco.

Horrendous coffee."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Sep 29, 2016","Former employee, more than 10 years","It's Cisco. Great in terms of employee benefits, professionalism, and fair policies. Very good in terms of social presence (progressive, diverse), community engagement, social welfare, etc...  Large company with options to move around, grow, and gain experience. Salary/compensation tends to fall on the upper side of range. Large product/solution footprint that covers a lot of technology. 800lb gorilla with worldwide presence. Good reputation, Hallmark technology company, lots of things to build with and sell.","Big company with the classic downsides. Internal culture and drivers have been impacted over the last decade by rapid development and shareholder/profit pressures. Most innovation is now acquired and assimilated. Not so much a knock, but where the company is in its evolutional cycle. The result is constant fluctuation in strategy, priorities, organization, and management. Unfortunately, career advancement/survival these days too often is knowing what bandwagon to jump on, when to jump off, and when to blame someone else. Lot of hardworking talented people get flushed in the process with the regular LRs. Too many managers ""manage up"" and not down."
Solutions architect,2.0,"Oct 31, 2016",Current employee,"Flexible/home working, benefits. Work life balance.","Depending on what part of the company you work for then your working experiences are different. This is highly sales focussed company, Services are a poor relation and often driven with cost reductions. TAC are well funded thanks to lucrative support renewals. Cisco is far too US focussed, almost ALL the new VP's and SVP's are American, with American strategies which only work in the US. Cost reduction appears to be high on the agenda and this impacts all aspects for a number of years now. Morale is poor and the People Deal they published is farcical considering the number of layoffs they constantly keep making. Promotions have not been communicated or transparent for a long, long time. No clear or defined career ladder either, this depends on what accounts and projects you get attached to tbh. Cisco appears to be trying to regenerate into a more youthful company to reduce costs but have lost a tremendous amount of industry experience and skills in doing so. Innovation is primarily hardware focussed. Very poor long term strategy or investment in Services, where the financials take precedence over quality, efficiency and innovation. Remote workers are VERY remote, hardly getting to see colleagues at all for years. I never saw my Manager face to face for three years! Get used to days and days siting on Webex calls."

Allow you to work remotely,"I joined with a good salary 5 years ago as a new grad out of college, and I have seen only ONE increment of 5% in the last 5 years. It was not like I was not doing good. They kept doing re-orgs and rotated me under different managers. Each manager said I needed to establish myself with him. And each one promised me a promotion next year which didnt happen. I saw other people in other groups getting promoted or salary hiked much faster and here I am slogging under one manager after another, sometimes doing junk work that the technical leads themselves do not want to take. I stayed on because they gave me flexibility to work from home which I needed as I was facing some family issues. I looked outside and landed up with an offer that directly gave me a 45% hike. Happy to get out of here finally! I would not advise young people to join Cisco unless they know they are getting the right pay, the right recognition and growth in their careers. Each group is different, not every group need to be like mine. But move out as soon as you find out you are stagnating or you are not being just-fully rewarded/promoted, within 6 months."

Cisco is HORRIBLE at rewarding employees (even if you are constantly told you are a top performer) which is causing many talented people to leave.  Focal cycles once a year at best that are funded to a level where they can only give you a 4% raise at most.  New hires today make more than people who have been here 5+ years.  The company is doing better than ever but this only translates to executive promotions and raises.  To get a raise you have to leave for a year and then you can get rehired at 2x your prior salary.
