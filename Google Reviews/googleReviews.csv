Program manager,4.0,"Jun 21, 2013","Former employee, more than 8 years","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
Software engineer iii,5.0,"May 10, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Feb 8, 2015",Current employee,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."
Program manager,4.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, intelligent and down to earth people (for the most part), and despite there being a lot disgruntled employees about the continued layoffs and mixed feelings about Sundar, Google still really is an exciting place to work with a lot of potential opportunity given the AI movement.","The truth is you could get laid off at any point... and this is coming from someone who was given the highest performance rating possible in 2024. Even if you're hired in August of this year, by Feb of next year there's a real chance leadership has made some top down decision to slash roles in your org or to prioritize a different location for your org. The environment at Google has been increasingly tense and stressful the last 3 years. Managers and those around you are more and more panicked, so it's only naturally that you'll feel the consequences of this in your day to day (bottom line, it's becoming a more stressful place to work and expectations are increasing each month),"
Software development engineer (sde),4.0,"Jul 28, 2025",Former employee,"Google is also known for offering generous benefits, a flexible work environment, and a focus on personal development and learning. The diversity of projects and the impact their work can have globally is another big draw for those who work there. Would you like to know more about specific aspects of Google's work culture","While many employees enjoy working at Google, some challenges have been reported by others. These can include:
1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.

2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences."
Account manager,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Benefits, Colleagues, Pay, Dog friendly and free food.
Overall its a great environment with plenty of perks, amazing people and opportunities to move and learn.","Everything here depends on your direct manager. You will either get a genuine leader who invests in your growth and success or a someone who pretends but is only there to make themselves look good and will actively make your life hell to push you out.

Holier than thou attitudes of middle managers make it very a very toxic and two-faced environment. If you don't follow blindly you will be pushed out of the company under the facade of ""support"". 

Expectations seem to be different for people in the same role depending on if a manager likes you or not.

Untrustworthy people in influential positions who play the politics game instead of actually serving customers. 

HR dont take reports of bullying and discrimination seriously enough.

They don't actually care about customers and doing things the right way, its a fake customer first mindset while you're forced to shove products down businesses throats even though it could ruin their business.

Overall - be very cautious of the people around you, because behind the smiles, fake ""we're a team and support each other"" talk and ""Googliness"", there are some who want you to fail."

The bar for performance is very high, and there’s pressure to constantly prove your impact.

Internal Competition

Promotions and top projects can be competitive. Visibility matters, and self-promotion is sometimes necessary.

Less Autonomy (in some roles)

In well-established teams, PMs may not have the autonomy to define the full product vision or roadmap.

Geographical Constraints

Some of the most exciting projects are tied to specific locations like Mountain View, which can limit flexibility."

Senior program manager,3.0,"Jul 20, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","Strong legacy and brand – Still carries a powerful global reputation that can boost your resume.
Smart, talented coworkers – Historically attracted some of the best minds in the industry.
Great compensation and benefits – Pay, stock options, and perks (like food and healthcare) are still competitive.","Loss of innovation culture – The once nimble and visionary culture has given way to risk aversion and red tape.
Management bloat and politics – Leadership changes, reorgs, and layers of bureaucracy have slowed execution.
Low morale and instability – Frequent layoffs, reorgs, and unclear direction have affected employee trust and motivation.
Career growth is uneven – Promotions can feel political or opaque; fewer meaningful opportunities to grow.
Declining work-life balance – Depending on the team, pressure and expectations have increased without added support."
Administrative,2.0,"Jun 19, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","The pay is highly competitive, and the perks are hard to beat—definitely one of the few places where the benefits package still feels generous. You’ll work with some incredibly smart, talented, and down-to-earth people who make the day-to-day bearable. Some tools and internal systems are well-developed and efficient, which helps get things done faster (when politics aren’t in the way).","Extremely bureaucratic and heavily political environment where who you know often matters more than what you do. There’s a constant cloud of looming layoffs, creating anxiety and instability across teams. Leadership is uninspiring at best, incompetent at worst—nepotism runs rampant, and accountability is nonexistent for people who play the “nice” card, regardless of performance.

The “golden handcuffs” are real. What once felt exciting and promising now just feels like a high-paying trap. The culture has taken a sharp nosedive, and morale is visibly deteriorating."

High-performing team environment

Clear growth opportunities

Meaningful, challenging work",Demanding pace and performance expectations (but rewarding for the right person
Engineer,5.0,"Jul 31, 2025",Current employee,"Advantages
High - salary and good benefits: Google offers generous compensation, enabling employees to earn substantial income. Additionally, the company provides outstanding welfare facilities, such as on - site swimming pools, world - class gyms, various sports classes, weekly massages, delicious and healthy meals, and on - site medical care, which contribute to employees' high - quality lifestyle.
Strong technical strength and learning opportunities: As a world - leading technology company, Google possesses cutting - edge technologies. Employees have the chance to access and learn these advanced technologies, enhancing their technical skills and professional competence. They can also gain valuable experience in dealing with complex engineering problems and world - class crisis management and debugging.
Good work - life balance: Google emphasizes a healthy work - life balance, allowing employees to maintain a relatively reasonable working hours and workload, which is conducive to their physical and mental health and the balance between work and life.
Positive corporate culture and excellent colleagues: The company has a positive corporate culture that encourages creativity and innovation. Employees can collaborate with talented professionals from diverse backgrounds, which not only promotes teamwork but also broadens their horizons.
Abundant career development opportunities: Google is committed to the personal and professional development of employees, providing various training programs and workshops. Employees have the opportunity to be promoted and can also explore different job roles and projects within the company, which is helpful for their career growth.","Disadvantages
High - pressure work and high cognitive load: Some positions at Google, such as site reliability engineering, may involve long - term on - call work, which can cause stress to employees and disrupt their sleep. Moreover, Google's technical systems are extremely complex, and employees need to remember numerous systems and technologies, facing a high cognitive load.
Unclear career progression: Career progression at Google can be challenging and depends a lot on the specific projects an employee is involved in. Some employees may find themselves stuck at a certain level, such as level 5, with limited opportunities for further promotion.
Serious internal politics: As the company grows, internal politics may become more prominent. In some aspects, such as performance management and recruitment, managers may need to engage in a lot of negotiation and manipulation, which can affect employees' work enthusiasm and morale.
Cultural differences and marginalization of non - US employees: Google has a strong US - centered culture. Employees who do not work in the US and do not have much influence in their locations may feel isolated or marginalized, and may also be troubled by late - night meetings due to time zone differences.
High - intensity competition: Google hires a large number of outstanding talents, resulting in fierce competition among employees. Everyone is highly qualified, and employees need to work hard to stand out, which may bring a lot of pressure."
Administrative,3.0,"May 28, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years",They offer a good wage package and the opportunity to do really amazing work if you have a decent team and leader. The campuses are beautiful.,"Promotion is all political and nearly impossible; it also eats up any managers  time FAR more than it needs to. Remote workers do not get any benefits like onsite workers do (ie free food, gym access, massage time, etc) - not even a gym stipend. Additionally management cannot make up their mind what is important when and change priorities constantly, which then spurs a big argument over either whose fault it is or who REALLY got the work done, but only by the executives, not the team. The culture you think you will find is no longer present, and it's quite heartbreaking. If you enjoy having an assigned desk, good luck. If you need extra peripherals at the hot desk you get assigned, or even working ones? Yeah, about that. It's now just another MS/AWS etc clone."

Low performers get away with doing nothing and still get decent performance ratings while high performers are only rewarded with more work for the same pay and often get low ratings. Managers have no idea what any of their direct reports actually do on a daily basis. They also play favorites and micromanage the people they don’t like. Long history of friends/significant others reporting to and being directly managed by each other - huge conflict of interest there but no one says anything. Promotion process is ambiguous and unclear, requires self-nomination, and there is a set quota for how many people can receive each rating. Used to be a cool, fun place to work but more and more amenities and privileges are taken away every year. Many long-term employees have rage quit mid shift, never to return again. They are laying off and firing hundreds of long-tenured employees while actively interviewing and hiring their replacements and the caliber of people they’ve been hiring lately is…questionable at best. An absolute shitshow. 0 stars, do not recommend.

Culture (Team Specific): Many teams foster a collaborative and open environment, encouraging idea sharing and teamwork. Being part of the vibrant tech community in Taipei is also a positive.","Work-Life Balance (Can Vary): While the company talks about work-life balance, the demanding nature of the work and fast pace can sometimes lead to long hours or difficulty fully disconnecting, depending heavily on the specific team and role.
Bureaucracy & Scale: As a massive global organization, navigating internal processes, getting approvals, or initiating changes can sometimes be slow or feel bureaucratic.
Integration Challenges: Working with global teams across different time zones can sometimes present communication or scheduling challenges.
Role Specificity: Your experience can vary significantly based on your specific team, manager, and project area. Not all teams operate identically."

Not specific to Google, and the worst is behind us, true, but they continue, just quieter. The standard is high, and when it comes time for management to make a tough decision, employees are stack ranked.

Technical infrastructure: Top-tier internal tools and platforms. Developer experience is miles ahead of other companies I’ve worked at.

Work-life balance: Generally very good, especially compared to startups. Managers tend to be respectful of personal time.

Career mobility: Easy to switch teams. I’ve changed projects twice with minimal friction and lots of support.

Perks: Free meals, shuttles, massage credits, generous parental leave. Still feels like a luxury job in many ways.","Promotion pacing: Promotions can feel slow and bureaucratic, especially at senior levels. You often need to demonstrate the next level for over a year before you’re even considered.

Decision-making overhead: Lots of alignment and consensus culture. It’s not always fast-moving.

Big-company inertia: Some teams have legacy code and slow processes that are hard to change.

Performance calibration: Peer comparisons and stack ranking can be stressful around review season. You need to actively advocate for yourself."

Cutting-edge Projects & Technology
Engineers often get to work on innovative and high-impact products like Search, Android, Chrome, and AI tools — with access to massive datasets, infrastructure, and advanced research.

Strong Learning Culture

Whether you're working on Search, Android, AI, or Cloud, the reach and responsibility are immense.
Top-Tier Colleagues: Google attracts some of the brightest minds in the industry. Collaboration here is a joy—engineers, designers, PMs, and researchers constantly push each other to improve and innovate.
Strong Engineering Culture: The technical infrastructure is world-class, and there’s a genuine commitment to code quality, performance, and long-term maintainability. Internal tools are powerful and well-supported.
Learning and Growth: There’s no shortage of opportunities to grow. You’re constantly exposed to cutting-edge research, internal tech talks, and mentorship from industry veterans.
Flexibility and Benefits: Generous compensation, excellent healthcare, parental leave, and work-from-home flexibility make it one of the best places in terms of work-life balance, especially post-COVID.","Large Company Trade-offs: Decision-making can be slow, especially when multiple layers of review or cross-org alignment are required. It’s easy to feel like a small cog in a massive machine if you're not on a flagship product.
Promotion Process: While the bar is high for advancement (which ensures quality), the calibration process can feel opaque or political at times."

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 28, 2025",Current employee,"The process we've gone through to analyze and manage the Docker images, particularly in addressing the large storage usage in the /var/lib/docker directory, has proven to be highly productive and efficient. By systematically identifying the root causes of the excessive disk usage—such as the accumulation of  tagged images, unused containers, and redundant image layers—we were able to devise a clear and actionable plan to reclaim significant disk space. The step-by-step approach, starting with checking the container references using docker ps -a, followed by removing unused containers with docker container prune, and then targeting the dangling images with commands like","docker image prune -f or the more direct docker images | grep '' | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u | xargs -r docker rmi -f, ensured that we addressed the issue comprehensively. This methodical cleanup not only reduced the storage footprint from 342GiB by approximately 70GiB by removing the  images but also set a foundation for better Docker resource management moving forward. Additionally, the process highlighted the importance of understanding Docker's image and container lifecycle, which can prevent similar issues in the future, making the overall workflow more streamlined and productive for maintaining system efficiency."

Contect writer,5.0,"Feb 28, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year","""Pros"" refers to the advantages or benefits of something. It's the opposite of ""cons."" When you're weighing the pros and cons of a decision, the ""pros"" are the positive factors to consider.
Here's a breakdown:
 * Definition:
   * Pros are the positive aspects, advantages, or benefits of a particular choice, action, or situation.
 * Usage:
   * It's commonly used in phrases like ""pros and cons,"" where you evaluate both the positive and negative aspects of something.
   * It can also be used independently to highlight the advantages of something.
   * Example: ""One of the pros of working from home is the flexibility it offers.""","The word ""cons"" can have a couple of different meanings, most commonly relating to:
 * Disadvantages:
   * This is the most frequent use, referring to the negative aspects or drawbacks of something. When discussing ""pros and cons,"" ""cons"" represent the reasons against a particular choice or action.
   * Example: ""We weighed the pros and cons of buying a new car.""
 * Confidence tricks:
   * ""Con"" can also refer to a dishonest scheme or swindle, intended to deceive someone. A ""con artist"" is someone who performs such tricks.
   * Example: ""He was a victim of a sophisticated con.""
Therefore, depending on the context, ""cons"" will either refer to negative aspects of something, or to a trick or scam."

Strategy & operations manager,2.0,"Jun 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",The microkitchens were great. Cafés were always good. The pay is top-tier.,"Google used to be a great place to work. There was a clear vision, great products, and a sense of fun in the workplace. Unfortunately, the ex-consulting management class as completely destroyed any semblance of what made this a great place to work. I watched it all happen during my 6 years at the company, from 2019-2025. Here are just a few examples:

Return-to-Office
Rather than embrace this once in a generation opportunity to reimagine work, leadership chose to double-down on meaningless office attendance tracking. Googlers are expected to commute to an office and fight for meeting room space to take video calls with colleagues across the world.

Location strategy:
Googlers in many functions are being pushes to move to lower cost locations (think Texas and Georgia) for the privilege of being paid less.

Career Growth:
Opportunities for promotion have all but evaporated. if you do want a promotion, or even a new role, expect to be asked to move to a lower cost location (see above).

Leadership
Management doesn't care about you or the product. Only about the stock price. They will tell you platitudes about coming together, about listening to feedback on surveys, about needing to do better, and then will continue to make decisions that make life worse and worse for you. Performance ratings are a moving target and everything the company does makes it seem like they're trying to make it easier to fire you or pay you less.

Product
Other than shouting ""AI!"" at every opportunity, there is no creativity left. Our products have been degraded by years of shortsighted, tight-fisted, avaricious decisions. It's a shame. We used to have the best products.

Bureaucracy
Despite all the layoffs (a topic for another day) the company is still as bureaucratic and frustrating as ever. There are teams upon teams that exist to justify their own existence, and getting things done is a struggle.

Overall there's a general sense of cowardice among the leaders of this company. There are no visionaries. Nobody wants to do anything. It's all performative leadership where directors talk about doing big things, and then nothing ever is accomplished because nobody will stick their neck out.

Google is resting on its laurels, and landing a job there isn't what it used to be."

However, during a medical leave in 2024, I was unexpectedly accused of policy violations - using corp to send personal messages. During this time, I was hospitalized abroad and barely opened my laptop.

Resources & perks: The company provides excellent resources for designers, including top-of-the-line software, research teams, and usability labs. Plus, the perks (benefits, work environment, learning opportunities) are world-class.
User-centric approach: Google takes UX seriously, and user research is embedded in the design process. If you're passionate about data-driven design, this is an ideal place to grow.
Impactful projects: The scale at which Google operates means your work can reach millions (or billions) of users worldwide.","Slow decision-making: Despite being a fast-moving tech giant, the sheer size of Google can make getting approvals and launching new features a slow process.
Hierarchy & bureaucracy: While the culture encourages open discussion, senior leadership ultimately has a lot of control over decisions, which can sometimes make innovation feel constrained.
Work-life balance depends on the team: Some teams have a healthy work-life balance, while others expect long hours. It largely depends on your manager and project deadlines.
High expectations & competition: The bar is set high, and performance expectations are demanding. It can be a high-pressure environment, especially for those looking to advance."

- The sales team is in structural decline, so always having to do 'more with less' and stemming declines in client investment is not very exciting or motivating
- Culture: Google is not 'Google' anymore, at least not the one famed for it's best in class benefits/work environment/employees. It's becoming more and more like McKinsey, with too many paper-pushers and not enough inspirational leaders or creative ideators (very evident in the product output lately!).

- Leaders don't care about individuals (especially if you dare to have children), you are just a number on a spreadsheet, and if you speak up about how things could be improved you are shut down with ""be glad you have a job here"""

While the scale of the projects is exciting, it can also mean lots of bureaucracy and slower decision-making. Navigating a large organization sometimes feels like moving through layers of process and alignment meetings. It’s easy to feel like a small cog in a massive machine, especially if you're not on one of the higher-visibility teams.

Continue to streamline processes to reduce bureaucracy and enhance agility. Providing clearer pathways for internal mobility can further motivate and retain talent."

Welcome to Google’s Steve Ballmer era.

 Your experience will vary vastly from department to department, team to team and manager to manager. I’ve had amazing experiences pre-Covid, and unusutainable situations post. With internal mobility limited having a bad manager becomes much more problematic than in the past with no real solution. A good number of sales is completely burnt out and certain sectors more difficult to work in than others due to sector customer growth trajectory. Also - being front line sales to staunch a bleeding search business is inherently not fun. Corp just launched a dashboard stack ranking all AE’s against their peers, and they are testing mandatory requirements to turn on AI call listening during customer calls (this will be used in future to assess how strong the salespeople are, and downstream eventually replace the salespeople). The department I was in (large customer sales) is over managed and given far too many metrics to hit. 

Stack ranking will become a clear and present danger in the next few years due to pressure cooker environment and very aggressive goals. My sector in LCS was a rotating firing squad for the manager who didn’t hit their numbers (for reference- this is usually a % of a brands overall revenue that goes to marketing…. And with less revenue in a recession, there are already headwinds before you factor in the decline of search advertising).

No meritocracy + highly political due to stack ranking and layoff fears - showing up for customers takes a back seat to bringing in short term revenue and hitting internal metrics.  1 person does work and 9 different teams take credit.  So you have to be comfortable being that 1 in 10 that does work, or the other 9 that take credit. Pick your poison. 

Certain levels (L6) are not long for this world in GBO, and the highest difficulty level for mobility right now is L5 due to L6s taking demotions to stay at the company, and L4 wanting growth. 

I was on a front line sales specialist team and organizationally it was chaos. In last 4 years had 4 restructures, 3 different roles under 3 different managers. If you happen to be part of a toxic org don’t take it personally if you feel on a constant spin cycle. In my department you would hit a metric in Q4, then 2 months later the calculation updates and you can go from 95% feature attainment to 20% with absolutely no change from your customer. So with a poor manager you could easily be quietly let go due to performance which the numbers would support, because on paper you’re not performing (due to the constant change). This makes your manager now make or  break. 

When I left I needed to schedule and run 3 hours of internal meetings per day in order to do my job and hit my feature adoption numbers as a front line seller. Spent 5% of time speaking with customers because the products were constantly changing and breaking.  Absolute nonsense

Top leadership talent in Ads left or leaving in the last year to go outside the company. 

If a friend had an offer I’d tell them to join unless they had another MAG7 offer, but be incredibly vigilant - check in with themselves once a quarter, and be ready to leave externally at a moments notice should conditions change.","internal mobility very difficult
- turning into IBM
- bureaucracy & largely uninteresting work
- Hours can be bad (50+) depending on team
- Burnout inevitable in new paradigm
- Dispersed teams leading to an isolated work environment

- dog eat dog / “what have you done today” culture
- limited learning / stalled career trajectory outside comp
- High stress hitting unrealistic metrics with limited support and control

Software engineer,2.0,"May 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","- The pay is very good. Very high year-on-year raises and bonuses, very lucrative stock shares.
- Depending on your team/product, it's possible to work on very high-visibility projects that look great on a resume.
- Lots of experience ""working at scale"" as per Google's favorite talking point
- It's true that most people you work with are really very smart, motivated, and proactive","- The company is moving in a direction that gives individual employees less and less freedom and judgement to do their jobs. The Google logic is: if we want people to start/stop doing something, we invest money into enforcing it. This applies to everything from minor coding style, to attendance and parking. Infringements of all kinds can result in a pay cut. The attendance policy uses your IP address to detect whether you're working from home or somewhere further away. Meeting rooms track faces, and will send you an email if not in your assigned meeting room 15 minutes into the meeting. Managers have a dashboard to see daily badge-ins.
- Very strong emphasis on hierarchy and individual ownership. Little emphasis on teams. Engineers are incentivized to ""own"" things and supervise others rather than to collaborate and help each other.
- Google is very old-fashioned in the way they do things. They live on not only a ""tech island"" but also a ""process island"". They are very invested in ""waterfall"" development style which favors writing a formal document before making any small code change, and then throwing it over the wall to a junior engineer to implement. Engineers aren't really encouraged to (or given time to) read and learn from sources outside of Google, so most engineers aren't aware of alternatives to or reasoning behind ""the google way"".
- Extremely conservative leveling and promotions. Promotions are highly political and depend heavily on your manager's motivation and presentation skills, which does not always feel very fair. You're typically pushed to operate at ""L+1"" for a year or more before you would be granted a promotion due to arbitrary requirements.
- Little support for junior developers. At lower levels, it can be really difficult to get assigned ""L+1"" projects which will allow you to be promoted. In my experience with multiple teams, it's very common for junior engineers to be isolated from the rest of the team, only getting passdowns from the engineer ""supervising"" their work and little exposure to the rest of the team. People tend to take contributions from lower-level engineers less seriously, solely based on their level, which means more friction to get your job done.
- As much as Google touts their ""fun"" spaces, and their anti-micromanagement philosophy, in practice, you get assigned way too much work to be able to make use of this. There is no time to learn and grow on your own. In all the years that I've worked for Google, I can count the number of conversations I've had with co-workers on two hands (and I'm a pretty social person). It's really not a people-centric company at all anymore."

Goog personal career","High Expectations and Pressure: Google is known for its rigorous hiring process and high-performance culture. Employees may face significant pressure to meet ambitious goals and maintain high productivity levels.
Work-Life Balance: The demanding nature of projects and the culture of innovation can lead to long hours and difficulties in maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Google can have bureaucratic processes that may slow down decision-making and lead to frustration among employees who prefer a more agile work environment.
Limited Role Flexibility: While there are opportunities for movement within the company, some employees may find that their roles can become very specialized, limiting their ability to explore other areas of interest.
Competition Among Peers: The competitive atmosphere can sometimes create tension among colleagues, which may affect collaboration and workplace relationships.
Privacy Concerns: Working for a tech giant like Google can raise ethical concerns about data privacy and surveillance, potentially leading to discomfort for some employees."

Brilliant Colleagues: My team includes some of the sharpest engineers I’ve met, with expertise in everything from machine learning to backend infrastructure. Code reviews and tech talks are learning goldmines.  

World-Class Resources: Access to Google’s internal tools, massive code base, and training programs (like ML bootcamps) accelerates skill growth. The ability to experiment with new tech is unmatched.  

Compensation and Perks: Competitive salary, generous RSUs, and benefits like free gourmet meals, shuttles, and wellness stipends make life comfortable in the Bay Area.  

Flexible Work: Hybrid work policies allow a balance of in-office collaboration and remote productivity, with great office spaces in Mountain View.","Bureaucracy Creep: Google’s size means layers of approvals for major changes, slowing down project timelines. Navigating cross-team dependencies can feel like a puzzle.  

Workload Spikes: High-profile launches (e.g., new Cloud features) can lead to intense periods, with some weeks pushing 50 hours. Not every team has this issue, but it happens.  

Promotion Complexity: Advancing to senior levels is tough, requiring visible impact and advocacy. The process feels opaque, and some talented engineers get stuck.  

Tooling Overload: While internal tools are powerful, their complexity and occasional legacy quirks can frustrate new hires or slow onboarding.  

Diluted Impact: On massive projects, individual contributions can feel like a drop in the bucket, especially compared to smaller companies where impact is more direct."

Limited Scope on Some Teams: Depending on the team, some employees might find their work focused on specific components rather than end-to-end features, potentially limiting the learning curve and overall impact on a single project.
Career Progression Challenges: Work done in a previous team might not always be fully considered for promotions after switching teams, potentially leading to slower career advancement for some individuals.
High Competition: Getting a job at Google is highly competitive, and the internal environment can also be competitive among talented individuals.
Potential for Bureaucracy: As a large company, Google can sometimes have bureaucratic processes that might slow things down or feel cumbersome.
Privacy Concerns: Some critics and employees have raised concerns about Google's data handling practices and their potential impact on user privacy.
Return-to-Office Mandates: Recent shifts towards hybrid work models and return-to-office mandates have been met with some resistance from employees who enjoyed the flexibility of fully remote work.
Layoffs and Restructuring: Like other tech companies, Google has experienced layoffs and restructuring, which can create uncertainty and impact employee morale.
""Big Company"" Feel: For some, the sheer size of Google can make it feel less like a start up and more like a large corporation, with potentially less individual impact on the overall direction of the company."

Product manager,3.0,"Apr 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Google is very flexible and respectful of your time and work/life priorities. People choose to lean in or lean back from their work depending on what works best for them. Medical leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, personal leave, and carers leave and all sorts of other benefits mean that this is really a job you can make work around anything else going on in your life.

With the new work on LLMs, Google search is also more exciting to work on again. We were already so optimized before, it was difficult to create anything fun and new. Now with new technology, there are more cool projects that feel innovative.","People do sometimes phone it in, and that can be frustrating if you are trying to accomplish something. That isn't my main concern, however. Within search, the director and above leadership seems incompetent. Comparing notes with colleagues, our guesses are: 1) They don't know how to build anything, 2) They have strange incentives are are playing their own games, 3) They are sociopaths 4) They are focused on their families and collecting 7-figure paychecks on the couch. My guess is #2-4. There are a few gems in leadership, but it's not enough.

Some managers are great, but most managers make you scratch your head. Given how promotions work at Google, becoming a manager as an engineer or as a PM has very little to do with skill, and much more to do with luck, time at the company, and how good your own manager was. There are many people I work with who are amazing, and there are also many Google lifers I do not believe would pass the hiring bar for managers if they started interviewing outside the company."

What an amazing place.,"Be in love with where you begin, and expect no power! People are rewarded to be very fake (very self oriented) as there is very little upwards movement.

Inside sales acount manager,3.0,"Mar 29, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","The food is good, but dinner is served late, feels like a tactic to keep you in the office longer.","If you’re looking for career development outside your immediate role, forget it. The company operates like a closed club, especially for the German market from Dublin, where networking and internal connections matter more than skills or performance. There’s little to no chance of moving beyond your current position unless you’re part of the inner circle.

The work environment is heavily driven by KPIs, with constant pressure to perform and outdo colleagues. Instead of fostering collaboration, the culture encourages internal competition, making long term motivation difficult. The focus on short term numbers and performance metrics creates a stressful atmosphere, with little regard for employee well being or professional growth.

The German market, whether managed from Dublin or Germany itself, is purely a marketing and sales organization. There is no real career development outside of these areas, making it impossible to grow beyond your initial role. Internal mobility is nearly non existent unless you have the right connections, and roles outside of sales and marketing are extremely limited.

At its core, the company operates like a call center, especially for sales roles. The focus is on making many calls and closing as many deals as possible, with little strategic thinking or real customer engagement. Employees are expected to follow rigid scripts, hit aggressive targets, and move on to the next lead. Creativity, problem solving, and long term customer relationships take a back seat to short term revenue generation.

In recent years, the company has increasingly felt the pressure from competitors, which has only made the work environment more stressful. Instead of adapting with innovation or long term strategies, leadership has responded by tightening KPIs and increasing micromanagement. The result is an even more high pressure, unsustainable culture where employees are pushed harder without any real investment in their growth or success.

On the positive side, if you’re okay with a rigid structure and thrive under continuous performance measurement, this might be a place for you. But for those seeking a supportive and forward thinking company with real career opportunities, it’s best to look elsewhere. Leaving feels more like a relief than a loss."

Career Growth: Google offers excellent learning and development opportunities, including mentorship, technical training, and career advancement.

Great Compensation and Benefits: Competitive salary packages, including stock options, bonuses, and comprehensive healthcare benefits, are a big plus.

Work-Life Balance: Despite high expectations, many Googlers report a reasonable work-life balance, with flexible working hours and remote work options.

Collaborative Culture: Google's flat organizational structure encourages open communication and collaboration across teams.

Perks: Free meals, transportation, gyms, and on-campus wellness services make life easier.

Impact: Working on products used by billions of people globally gives employees a sense of purpose and impact.","High Competition: Google is full of high-performing individuals, which can sometimes make it feel competitive or hard to stand out.

Bureaucracy: As Google has grown, it has developed layers of bureaucracy, which can slow decision-making or create red tape.

Limited Mobility: While career growth is encouraged, some employees find it challenging to move between teams or departments due to internal competition.

Pressure to Perform: The high-performance culture can lead to stress, especially when working on high-visibility projects with tight deadlines.

Large Company Feel: Some people may feel lost in such a large organization, where it's easy to become a small cog in a giant machine.

Frequent Re-orgs: Google's internal teams often go through re-organizations, which can disrupt workflows and cause uncertainty.

Remote vs. Onsite Tensions: Despite remote options, there is still some tension between fully remote employees and those based in large offices, especially in terms of collaboration and visibility."

Focus on New Tech: TechHive actively supports using the latest Flutter updates and packages, which keeps the work exciting and relevant. The company encourages innovation and even supports developers in attending relevant workshops and conferences.
Growth Opportunities: There are clear growth paths, and regular one-on-one meetings with managers help keep career goals on track. I had the chance to lead small projects, which helped me build my leadership skills.","Occasional Tight Deadlines: Project deadlines can sometimes be a bit tight, leading to some long hours. While the company does try to acknowledge the extra effort, a bit more time for quality assurance would be beneficial.
Communication Hiccups Across Departments: Occasionally, there were miscommunications between departments that delayed projects. A more streamlined approach to interdepartmental collaboration would make projects smoother.
Limited Documentation for Legacy Code: Some of the legacy code wasn’t well-documented, which added time to projects. They’re working on improving this, but it can be a challenge for newcomers."

In Taiwan, this is likely to be very attractive, combined with a comprehensive benefits package that often includes health insurance, retirement plans, and various employee perks.

Innovative and Impactful Work: Google is a global leader in technology, and working there offers the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects that impact millions of users worldwide. This can be very motivating and provide significant career growth.

Positive Work Culture: Google is famous for its employee-centric culture. This often translates to a comfortable and stimulating work environment with a focus on collaboration, creativity, and work-life balance. Google Taiwan likely embodies many of these cultural aspects.

Career Development Opportunities: Google provides ample opportunities for professional development, including training programs, internal mobility, and the chance to work with talented colleagues from diverse backgrounds.

Location and Quality of Life: Taiwan offers a high quality of life with a relatively low cost of living compared to many other tech hubs. It's known for its friendly people, delicious food, vibrant culture, and beautiful scenery. Working at Google in Taiwan allows you to enjoy these benefits.","Potential for Bureaucracy: As a large multinational corporation, Google may have bureaucratic processes that can sometimes slow down decision-making and project execution.

Competition: Google attracts top talent, so there can be a highly competitive environment. This could create pressure to constantly perform at a high level.

Work-Life Balance Challenges: While Google aims for good work-life balance, the demands of working for a global tech giant can sometimes lead to long hours or the need to be available outside of typical work hours.

Salary Differences: While compensation is generally good, salaries in Google Taiwan may be lower compared to those in the United States for similar roles.

Limited Scope: Depending on the specific role and team in Taiwan, there might be fewer opportunities to work on certain cutting-edge projects compared to Google's headquarters."

OKRs, goal setting, fact checking - exists in theory but not in practice. It's all slideware and moving numbers around to make it look like people are working on impactful projects while very little actually gets done.

I watched a team struggle for the better part of a year to build a simple dashboard so that executives could know where key inventory was located and how much of it was available. They seem to struggle with processes that any non-tech supply chain or retail organization does extremely well.

Folks in Cloud are gaming the hiring committee to bring in nepotism hires that seem incapable of bringing about measurable business impact. They are contributing to the lack of transparency and covering for each other's misconduct.

Org structures are set up to fail. Managers communicate almost exclusively through TPMs to avoid accountability for their decisions, Bad actors create information bottlenecks where all status reports or leadership direction flow up and down only through them. I have observed individuals spread disinformation under the guise of executive direction. These same people misrepresent project information upward in a way that is convenient for their own careers, usually at the expensive of another employee.

Additionally, the chance to network within a globally recognized company not only bolsters resumes but also opens doors for future career opportunities. Overall, a Google internship is a transformative experience that can significantly shape one's professional journey.","While interning at Google offers many benefits, there are also some potential downsides. The highly competitive environment can be overwhelming for some interns, leading to stress and pressure to perform at a high level. Additionally, the sheer size of the company may result in interns feeling like just another number, with limited direct interaction with top executives or decision-makers. Interns might also encounter a steep learning curve, especially if they lack experience with the specific tools or technologies used within their teams. Furthermore, the focus on performance metrics can create a challenging atmosphere where interns feel the need to constantly prove their value. Lastly, the cost of living in areas where Google offices are located, such as Silicon Valley, can be prohibitively high, making it difficult for some interns to manage their finances effectively."

Gone are the days where Google values people first. Now, everyone is just a number and a means to an end in getting anything done. And the ""do more with less"" mantra is highly used. Many folks are taking mental health leave for stress, burnout, and complete dissatisfaction with their jobs. The culture is now dog-eat-dog. Your opinions are not valued. They want you to do what you're told, keep your head done, and stay silent. You aren't valued for your brain here anymore. In fact, expressing an opinion or an opposing view to any senior execs will have you fired. There is no psych safety and everyone clings on to just having a job and a large paycheck.

Software developer,5.0,"Feb 25, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year","One of my favorite perks of working at Google India was sleeping in the office cabs on my way to home after a hectic day at work. Also, the cab service is only offered in India. In US, Google provides a shuttle service but the cab service doesn’t exist in any other country (to the best of my knowledge).
Talking about wallets, the security is pretty great. You can leave your wallet, watch, laptop etc. anywhere in the office and can expect to find it back in the same place the next day or with security. In my 2 years at Google, I never heard of anyone’s stuff getting stolen.
Most roles allow for some overseas travel opportunities. I went on a business trip to Europe. I followed all the guidelines for daily allowances (which is pretty generous) and wasn't asked a single question about it. I had drinks when I wanted to and had all kinds of exotic food on the company's card. Some Companies are cost driven where as Google is Value driven. (The cost of asking for business justification for each & every bill is more expensive than letting the employee do some productive work in that time. See point no. 4 under culture)","Google India offers very limited scope for career growth. You obviously can’t become the CEO/SVP/VP working from India when more than 80% of your workforce is based out of Mountain View. The roles in India are very limited too since only a handful organisations are based out of India.

Sooner than later, anyone, who has some iota of ambition and are not constrained by family, move to Mountain View. (The internal mobility is pretty great by the way minus the tons of competition for good roles. See point no. 1)
Google runs a lot of programs to train its management and provides a lot of support to its employees to keep them stress free and remove all politics from the workplace. However, Google is a system run by people and at the end of the day people are flawed. Some politics does creep into the picture. It might be comparatively less than many other places but it does exist."

Accountant,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Health & Dental Benefits + Equity.,"5.8% of the company made up of African & African Americans.
The promise of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives often falls short, as funding meant to support HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and programs for Black professionals in tech can sometimes serve as a superficial effort, rather than creating real change within companies. Many Black employees struggle to advance into leadership positions, facing a lack of genuine support and mentorship. In contrast, White and Asian employees often receive more direct support, as these groups are more prominently represented in leadership roles.

Google’s ""Stay & Thrive"" program, for instance, aims to assist employees who identify as Black, Hispanic, or Native American when they encounter challenges with their managers. This program helps them find new roles within the company without their current manager’s knowledge. However, while a few Black employees may receive support through such initiatives, it’s a small percentage—around 1%.

Given this reality, it's crucial for Black professionals to cultivate their own businesses and alternative income streams outside of major tech companies like Google. While these companies are often celebrated, the reality can be different for underrepresented groups, and the intellectual capabilities of Black professionals are sometimes met with discomfort or resistance within these spaces."

- Good pay overall for a software engineer, but pay last few years starting to stagnate compared to other Big Tech. I would not say Google pays very top of market anymore, despite what they would claim.
- Internal software development stack is generally pretty good, with some exceptions.
- Lot's of innovative and interesting projects still going on, despite the size if the company. You just need to find the right group to work with and it can be great, find the wrong one and it can be boring and have dysfunctional culture dynamics going on.","- The culture from up top as changed dramatically, Google's leadership has dropped the ball in terms of company culture for many years now and they simply don't care about fixing it. It certainly could be much worse, there are plenty of places to work with more dysfunctional and terrible cultures, but the magical awesome culture Google was known for from top to bottom is dead and has been dead for a long time. And it's clear leadership considers this a feature, not a bug.
- Promotions outside of Senior have gotten much harder as Google as focused on belt-tightening. It's becoming much harder to be recognized and pay raises are not as good as they use to be. Not bad, but they are no longer paying very top of market, unless of course you have some special skills with AI (PhD, worked at an well-known AI start-up, etc.).
- Lot's of legacy systems and code to deal with, of wide varying quality. Pretty standard stuff considering the age of the company, but you need to be comfortable learning about really old systems that have gotten crufty over time. And expect a hard time getting the time & resources to make the improvements that really are necessary."

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Sep 26, 2024","Current employee, more than 10 years","The engineering tools are truly amazing! You don't know scale until you know Google scale. IMO, AI and the internal development tools have greatly improved the experience of coding at Google. There are still some truly smart people there, and you can have a technical or whimsical conversation with almost anyone.

Even though the perks have disappeared, most of the perks and opportunities are still good. There is definitely name recognition.","It feels like more of a conventional company than when I started. There is constant fear of layoffs, and while most people are great, there are some toxic engineers. There is a fair amount of pressure, but the bureaucracy is pretty intense to keep you from moving fast.

It is strongly hierarchical and current leaders lack vision and cater to the shareholders.

The competition against similar companies is very stiff so there is a lot of pressure - feels like the engineers are fighting for their jobs and Google is fighting for its life."

Technical solutions consultant,4.0,"May 12, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","Google has among the best w/l balance in tech. No one in my org works very hard. I imagine the average person in my org spends 20-30 hours per week working. 

Google still pays top of market for this role and many others. Very few other tech companies pay their Solutions Consultants similar amounts of money.

Google still has a good reputation in the industry overall, so it will be helpful to have their name on your resume if looking elsewhere.","Politics. A lot of effort needs to be put into impressing managers with the ""great work"" you have done. However the work we do in my org is not groundbreaking. A lot of it is low impact and borderline meaningless. Regardless you have to put on a whole show for managers and your peers so you can get a decent performance review.

Despite the stock being at an all-time high, the org is very unstable right now and we have been waiting for layoffs for over half a year at this point. Most of us assume one is coming, so we're just waiting. It's difficult to focus on work and be happy at work when a layoff is in the back of your mind.

Internal mobility is very restricted at the moment. Few teams are hiring, so you are kind of stuck where you are at.

Leadership are mostly drones or yes men/women. It's like no one has a mind of their own and they just repeat whatever their own leadership tells them."

Plenty of alternative options for commuters, buses, shuttles, on-campus rideshare, and hybrid/remote work depending on your role and work. Also even for hourly there seemed to be some flexibility with hours, to a fault even; some team members made ample use of the unlimited sick days.

Software engineer,1.0,"Apr 8, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years",Good to have on your CV.,"It's just too intense. There is constant pressure to deliver ""perfect"" and scaleable solutions. Performance review is overly bureaucratic. Promotions are unfair: it mostly depends on how good your manager is and how well people know you. As a result, everyone constantly wastes time in pointless meetings and talking about their work just to gain visibility, as oppose to actually working. Risk-taking is not rewarded; you should not bother spending time on projects that are not guaranteed to succeed. It is better to land a mediocre incomplete product that will live long enough to get you promoted before getting killed off. The team I was on saw many of the most senior VPs and directors abandoning the project when they saw that it wasn't profitable, which is unfair because those at are bottom of hierarchy do not have access to these profit margins, but they end up paying the cost of the failure. Quantity is highly favoured and quality is silently punished. For example, I interviewed many candidates and spend a lot of time and effort to ensure that my interview reports were well-written and detailed, but I noticed that my colleagues hardly cared about this and wrote short and appallingly written reports. Guess which interviewer was shamed on? Me, because apparently I was ""slower"" than my peers. I want to say that the layoffs made things worse, but I'm starting to thinking that's not true. If anything, what the layoffs did is really just shred light on everything that's wrong with the company."

Google's dedication to employee growth, with ongoing training and development opportunities, has not only enhanced my skills but also provided a clear path for career progression.

Google's emphasis on work-life balance, reflected in flexible arrangements and comprehensive wellness programs, has contributed to a positive and thriving work atmosphere. Transparent communication from leadership fosters a sense of trust and unity, making Google not just a workplace but a community. In summary, Google stands out as an outstanding place to work, offering a supportive culture, ample growth opportunities, and a healthy work-life balance. I highly recommend Google to those seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career.","While Google is undoubtedly a remarkable company to work for, like any workplace, it's essential to consider potential challenges. Here are some cons to be aware of:

Intense Work Environment: Google is known for its fast-paced and dynamic work environment. For some individuals, the pressure and pace may be challenging to manage, leading to potential stress or burnout.

Large Organization Challenges: Being a massive multinational corporation, Google's sheer size can sometimes result in bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes. Navigating through the organizational hierarchy may require patience and persistence.

High Expectations: Google sets high expectations for its employees, aiming for innovation and excellence. While this can be motivating, it may also create a demanding atmosphere where meeting and exceeding expectations becomes the norm."

Line level leaders and individual contributors are not trusted or empowered. You are expected to prove your value regardless of the performance criteria you are demonstrating.

Stack ranking is adhered to in a militant way, even if it means downgrading high performing individuals. 

Strategy and understanding up critical work-streams have strong gaps in leaders competency, this results in undervaluing central dependancies and team members that keep the lights on and deliver value year over year with little recognition.

From day one, I was encouraged to think outside the box, experiment with new technologies, and challenge the status quo. The emphasis on innovation is palpable in every project and team meeting, creating an environment where groundbreaking ideas flourish.

Moreover, the level of talent and expertise among my colleagues is unparalleled. Working alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry has not only accelerated my professional development but has also inspired me to strive for excellence in everything I do. The collaborative spirit at Google is truly remarkable, with teams coming together seamlessly to tackle complex problems and deliver world-class solutions.

In addition to the stimulating work environment, Google places a strong emphasis on employee well-being and work-life balance. The company offers a plethora of perks and benefits, including competitive compensation, comprehensive healthcare coverage, and ample opportunities for career advancement. Furthermore, the flexibility to work remotely has been invaluable, allowing me to maintain a healthy balance between my professional and personal life.","However, it's worth noting that Google's fast-paced environment may not be suitable for everyone.

Data sienctist,5.0,"Nov 18, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Cutting-Edge Technology:
Google provides access to some of the best tools, platforms, and data infrastructure in the industry. Working with massive datasets and state-of-the-art machine learning models has been a highlight of my role. I’ve had the chance to use and even contribute to tools like TensorFlow and BigQuery, which has significantly enhanced my technical skill set.

Impactful Work:
The projects I’ve been involved in have a tangible impact, not just on Google’s products but also on billions of users worldwide. Whether it’s improving search algorithms, optimizing ad performance, or working on user personalization, there’s always a sense of purpose and responsibility tied to the work.

Collaboration and Learning:
The collaborative culture at Google is unparalleled. I’ve worked alongside incredibly smart and motivated colleagues from diverse backgrounds. The open culture encourages brainstorming and sharing ideas, which has been invaluable for learning and professional growth.

Work-Life Balance:
Google supports a healthy work-life balance with flexible hours and remote work options (depending on the team). The on-site perks, like world-class cafeterias, fitness facilities, and tech support, also make it easy to manage day-to-day life.

Career Growth Opportunities:
There are ample opportunities to grow, whether it’s through lateral moves, promotions, or access to internal learning resources. Google encourages upskilling, and they provide support for attending conferences or taking relevant courses.","High Expectations:
While the work is exciting, the expectations are equally high. Deadlines can be tight, and there’s always pressure to deliver innovative solutions. For someone new, the pace might feel overwhelming initially.

Complexity in Decision-Making:
Being part of such a large organization means that processes and approvals can sometimes be slower due to multiple layers of stakeholders.

Competition for Projects:
With so many brilliant minds at Google, standing out can be a challenge. There’s always a need to prove your value and take initiative, especially if you’re aiming for high-visibility projects."

From the moment I joined the company, I was struck by the collaborative and innovative work culture that Google fosters. The emphasis on creativity and problem-solving is evident in every project and meeting, making it an inspiring environment to work in.

Work Environment:
Google's Bangalore office is vibrant and filled with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. The open-office layout encourages collaboration, and the availability of various resources, such as breakout rooms and quiet spaces, enhances productivity. The company also prioritizes employee well-being, offering numerous amenities, including free meals, fitness centers, and wellness programs.

Projects and Technologies:
The projects I’ve been involved in have been challenging and intellectually stimulating. Google encourages engineers to take ownership of their work, allowing for a sense of pride in contributions to impactful products. I’ve had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, including machine learning, cloud computing, and scalable systems design. The freedom to experiment and innovate is a significant aspect of the role.

Learning and Growth Opportunities:
Google places a strong emphasis on professional development. There are numerous training programs, workshops, and access to online courses that help employees enhance their skills. The culture of mentorship is prevalent, with many senior engineers willing to share their knowledge and provide guidance. Regular performance reviews and feedback sessions help in setting clear goals and career paths.

Work-Life Balance:
While the work can be demanding, Google understands the importance of maintaining a work-life balance. The flexible work hours and the option to work remotely when needed have greatly contributed to my overall job satisfaction. The emphasis on mental health and well-being is evident, with resources available to support employees.","High Expectations: Google has very high standards, and the pressure to meet performance metrics can sometimes feel overwhelming. This can lead to stress, particularly for new employees adjusting to the pace and expectations.

Complex Organizational Structure: The size and complexity of Google can make it challenging to navigate. At times, communication between teams can be cumbersome, leading to delays in decision-making and project execution.

Rapid Changes: The fast-paced environment means that projects and priorities can change quickly. While this can be exciting, it can also be frustrating for those who prefer a more stable work environment.

Workload Variability: Depending on the team and project, workloads can vary significantly. Some teams may experience intense periods of work, while others may have less demanding schedules, leading to an inconsistent work-life balance"

Accelerated growth consultant,1.0,"Nov 21, 2024","Former employee, more than 1 year","The office is nice, decent salary, nice benefits such as free good, gym and more. Nice team mates.","Starting a new job should be an exciting chapter, filled with hope, ambition, and the eagerness to grow. That’s exactly how I felt when I began my role as an Accelerated Growth Consultant. But what unfolded over time shattered me in ways I never thought possible.

The excitement I brought to this job was quickly replaced by dread, anxiety, and a constant feeling of inadequacy. My manager silently targeted me, and it became clear over time that he had simply decided one day that I wasn’t someone he wanted on the team. It wasn’t overt bullying, but the kind that slowly eats away at your confidence and sanity. He excluded me from important conversations, sabotaged my work behind closed doors, and painted me as incompetent during graduate reviews with fabricated claims.

I wasn’t alone in this experience. Other teammates were subjected to the same treatment, often deciding to leave the company because they simply couldn’t cope. Some of them confided in me about how this manager made them feel so worthless that they contemplated suicide. It’s horrifying to think how one person could cause so much pain and distress in others.

When I reported these issues to HR, I was met with gaslighting. My concerns were minimized, twisted, or ignored entirely. HR seemed more interested in protecting the company than addressing the harm caused by this manager. Despite multiple complaints from different people, he faced no accountability. Instead, he was rewarded with promotions and opportunities in other departments and even international roles.

The Accelerated Growth Consultant role itself was stressful and chaotic. There was no clear structure or straightforward path to success. It wasn’t like a traditional sales role where you could track your progress and adjust accordingly. Instead, everything depended on whether the clients decided to spend—and if they didn’t, you were the one held accountable. It was a constant cycle of confusion, stress, and fear of missing targets.

By the time I left the company, I felt utterly drained and destroyed. A piece of my soul had been taken. I came in full of energy and positivity, only to be worn down by a system that allowed toxicity to thrive unchecked.

This experience taught me how deeply workplace bullying and poor leadership can impact mental health. No one should ever feel like their job is tearing them apart from the inside, and no one should suffer in silence because their concerns are dismissed. It’s time for companies to take reports of bullying seriously and hold managers accountable for the harm they cause. Anything less is unacceptable."

Software engineer,4.0,"Sep 15, 2023","Current employee, more than 3 years","- Pay is very high, especially if you have strong performance reviews year-on-year - Coworkers are highly intelligent and proactive - Very good and well-supported internal tooling (if sometimes overly complex) - Fairly easy to transfer within the company - Relatively relaxed attitude around work schedules and in-person attendance in the office, depending on the team","- Very hierarchical in both structure and style. Decisions from minor code style choices to team processes to larger policies are usually made by some group at a high level and uniformly applied to all, and enforced. - Constant reorgs mean swapping managers every 6 months or so - Incentivizes competition between engineers, which blunts collaboration - Very established ways of doing things that are in many ways frozen in time because of all the heavyweight internal tooling that would be too expensive to change ""at google scale"", as people love to say. Most teams use waterfall methodology. Long-winded, formal detailed design documents are typically prepared by one person and then handed off to the implementers. - Tends to favor overly complex code and documentation - The monorepo makes developing for/with open source libraries a nightmare - Takes a long time to get comfortable/efficient with the Google engineering ecosystem and its ways of doing things. - Cumbersome promotion process that makes getting promoted quickly after joining very difficult - Teams tend to be very meeting-adverse, which makes it difficult to feel connected with distributed teams - Diversity, Equity & Inclusion efforts are talked up all the time, but in reality, this is probably the least inclusive company I have ever worked for. - Shady ethics around the company's ""mission"" that everyone seems to turn a blind eye to"

Talented Peers: One of the most enriching aspects of working at Google is the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. The level of talent and expertise among colleagues is exceptional, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.

Engineering manager,2.0,"Mar 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 8 years","Brilliant technical staff, and excellent coworkers.","The culture has changed significantly. Good leaders empower brilliance and excellence, they don't discourage or inhibit them. It seems like all the good, empowering leaders have left Google, and were replaced by people who are actively preventing people from being their best. 

For example, the old self-assessment / peer-assessment / leadership-assessment ""Perf"" system was brilliant and was a model that other companies followed. It was turned down and replaced by an atrocious ""expectations / anonymous adhoc feedback / check-in"" system that makes everyone feel like they're on a PIP. 

The highest performers are discouraged from setting ambitious goals, and ""doing the right thing for the company"", and are instead encouraged to define modest goals that strictly match the role profile description of their role. The highest priority is ""meeting the expectations"". It feels like whoever is leading People Operations is actively trying to sabotage morale, burn people out, and cause the highest performers to look for the door."

Software engineer,4.0,"Feb 12, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Google has a rich history of engineering excellence and brilliance. Even many years removed from the height of the company's innovation, some of this is still evident through a strongly ingrained engineering culture where things are mostly done in an engineering first mindset. Engineering excellence is obvious across the organization and the products/infrastructure built at Google are a testament to this.

Work life balance is, for the most part, extremely good and good work life balance is ingrained in the culture. I have never experienced pressure from managers to work more than 40 hours a week, and the vacation + holidays are decent (though maybe not the absolute best).","There is a clear lack of vision from top management as many of Google's recent ""big"" initiatives seem to be reactive to other tech companies (instead of proactive). When compared to top executives at similar large companies, the current management falls quite short.

A complicated performance/promotion process exists at Google in an effort to measure employees fairly across the large company, however this comes at the cost of wasted cycles and the gamification of the system. This, along with the large variation in teams results in non-uniform opportunities for promotion/career advancement."

Today, the company has grown so fast and so large that now the majority of people seem to be typical tech industry employees. That means most of the management has now come from outside the company, so that has killed the culture. Psychological safety is gone, especially after the way the layoffs were handled. I miss Laszlo Bock; he knew how to treat the workforce. I miss Larry, Sergey, and Eric. The general quality of my peers has gone down. Not as people, they're all lovely, but as practitioners. Most of them do what we'd have considered low-quality work 5 years ago. It's shockingly bad, really, by comparison. They've all been hired so fast and in such an environment where they weren't properly trained or didn't have the proper background to begin with or haven't been given the time and mentorship required to become great (investing in people)."

2. Scope for promotions is very less due to high competition
3. I was shocked to learn that performance review for every individual in this organization is relative. Completing your yearly OKRs and performing excellent on your engagement gives you below average rating at best. You also need to participate in extra curicular activities to ""improve"" your visibility even though its an optional OKR. In every other modern tech company performance reviews are compared against a candidate's own previous reviews. But not here LOL.
4. Most of the Managers leading these organizations have polluted Google's work culture by bringing their own. Despite undergoing training for the same.

Work-Life Balance: Google generally offers a good work-life balance, with flexible working hours, remote work options, and a variety of wellness programs. The company also provides generous vacation and parental leave policies.

Compensation and Benefits: Google is known for offering competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package, including health insurance, retirement plans, and other perks like free meals, on-site gyms, and transportation.

Prestige and Network: Working at Google is prestigious and can be a significant boost to your career. It opens doors to a vast professional network and opportunities both within and outside the company.","High Expectations and Pressure: Google has high standards, and the pressure to perform can be intense. The fast-paced environment may require you to continually push your limits, which can be stressful over time.

Large Organization Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Google has multiple layers of management and processes. This can sometimes lead to bureaucracy, slow decision-making, and limited autonomy in certain roles.

Competition for Advancement: Given the high caliber of talent at Google, competition for promotions and high-impact projects can be fierce. This can make career progression challenging, especially in more crowded or mature areas.

Scope of Role: At a company as large as Google, your role might be very specialized, which can limit your exposure to the full spectrum of data science tasks. This could be a drawback if you prefer more generalist roles or want to work on end-to-end projects."

If you do large projects and keep your managers in the loop (like one should as L3 and L4), they say you need hand-holding. If you try to do things independently, they say you are being insubordinate. There's no one way that you can go. Managers outright lie in performance reviews. Add info or projects that were never delegated to you, and even if you escalate it, no one takes note of it, and you become the bad guy. They also like being boot-licked, and such people are showered with spot and peer bonuses for their regular tasks, tasks they were hired for. I will run out of examples, the fact is Google is a sham, and it's worse because they sell ""Googlyness"". It's laughable. No career growth and projects just don't launch. If there's more work and you end up working on a holiday, your manager will put that as your incompetence.

• Lots of internal resources to grow one's career, leadership, and skill set","Google used to have an amazing company culture and flat structural leadership. It's what made Google unique and stand out from the rest. Google has since lost it's overall 'unique company culture' by squeezing out innovation unless its perfecting AI to beat out its competitors. Company moral has tanked, employee input no longer feels authentically heard, valued, and actionable, budget constraints have caused a slim chance in promotion - even when consistently demonstrating next level performance. It's also become difficult to transfer btwn different teams to grow one's Google career. Headcount and resources have been restricted, resulting in stiff competition when applying to new roles.
Google has become another heavy, top-down corporate enterprise using tall organizational structure for more leadership control.

Employees have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects and technologies, which can be incredibly stimulating and rewarding.

Perks and Benefits: Google offers a wide range of perks such as free meals, fitness centers, laundry services, and more. Additionally, their employee benefits package is often considered one of the best, including health care, retirement plans, and generous parental leave policies.

Learning and Development Opportunities: Employees at Google have access to various learning resources and professional development programs. This environment encourages continuous learning and growth, enabling employees to enhance their skills and advance in their careers.","Work-Life Balance Challenges: Due to the demanding nature of the work and a culture that often celebrates 'going the extra mile', some employees find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Competitive Environment: While being surrounded by highly talented individuals can be inspiring, it can also create a highly competitive atmosphere. This can sometimes lead to stress and pressure to perform at very high levels constantly.

Large Company Bureaucracy: As a large corporation, Google has its share of bureaucracy. This can mean slower decision-making processes, less autonomy in certain roles, and the potential for getting lost in the corporate structure, making it harder for some individuals to make a significant impact."

This habit of checking boxes/KPIs goes all the way to the regional president level on the GBO side, which is a bit crazy. That is, at the regional president level, they will feel constrained on strategy / execution in order to hit KPI targets for things like feature adoption at the client level.

Very toxic management, therefore a very toxic work culture overall. Every quarter is a rat race. You have to prove yourself again and again. This means everyone is in survival mode (high burnout alert) - if for some reason you don't hit the numbers, you have to keep justifying your performance. So many people are put on PiP due to unrealistic targets set to show high growth, especially in times of uncertainty. Simply put, a very toxic and demotivating leadership style that shows how replaceable every hard-working employee is.

- Horrible PERF - Google like data, so if you don't have the data and numbers to prove what you did, don't bother adding it in your PERF or whatever it is called now.
- Poor Managers: I had a manager who only cared about what the stakeholders thought, put me down in team meetings, and never really figured how much pressure they were putting on me until I decided to leave. Too little too late?
- When i interviewed for this role, I was made to meet a Senior Leader who intimated me, and basically told me I would fail in the role. What happened to candidate experience."

Google emphasizes professional development with training programs and career advancement opportunities, creating a rewarding and dynamic work environment.","Working at Google, like any big tech company, has its challenges. One major downside is the demanding work culture associated with the tech industry. Google sets high expectations, tight deadlines, and operates in a fast-paced environment, causing stress and pressure. The competitive atmosphere can be overwhelming for employees, and the constant push for innovation means keeping up with rapidly changing technologies. This demands continuous skill updates, impacting work-life balance. The company's size may lead to a bureaucratic structure, making it tough for individuals to make a meaningful impact in certain situations."

High Expectations: Google sets very high standards for its employees, which can lead to stress and the need to consistently perform at a high level. Long Hours: Some employees may find themselves working long hours to meet project deadlines or handle the demands of their roles. Hierarchical Structure: Google is a large organization, and navigating its hierarchy can sometimes be challenging for employees who prefer a flatter organizational structure."

Software engineer,5.0,"May 28, 2024",Current employee,"Working at Google comes with numerous advantages that make it a desirable workplace for many professionals. One of the key benefits is the innovative and dynamic work environment that encourages creativity and personal growth. Google's culture of constant learning and development provides employees with opportunities to explore new ideas and technologies, which can lead to exciting career advancements.

Additionally, Google offers attractive perks and benefits, such as competitive salaries, generous leave policies, and extensive health and wellness programs. The company also places a strong emphasis on work-life balance, with initiatives like flexible work hours and remote work options, allowing employees to better manage their personal and professional responsibilities.

Furthermore, working at Google means being part of a diverse and inclusive community that values collaboration and teamwork. Employees have the chance to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry, fostering a culture of innovation and a sense of belonging within the organization.

Overall, the advantages of working at Google extend beyond the typical benefits package, offering a unique and fulfilling experience that can help employees to thrive both personally and professionally.","Working at Google is often viewed as a prestigious and desirable job opportunity. With its innovative technology, top-notch benefits, and collaborative work environment, it's no wonder many individuals aspire to be a part of the Google team. However, like any job, there are also downsides to working at Google.

One of the main drawbacks of working at Google is the high level of competition and pressure that employees face. The company is known for its fast-paced and demanding work culture, which can be overwhelming for some individuals. Additionally, the high expectations and constant need to innovate and perform can lead to burnout and stress among employees.

Another downside of working at Google is the lack of work-life balance. Due to the demanding nature of the job and the company's strong focus on productivity, employees often find themselves working long hours and sacrificing personal time. This can have negative effects on their overall well-being and relationships outside of work.

Furthermore, despite Google's reputation for being a diverse and inclusive workplace, there have been instances of discrimination and bias within the company. Issues such as gender pay gaps and lack of representation among certain groups have been raised, highlighting the challenges that employees may face in terms of inclusivity and equal opportunities.

In conclusion, while there are many benefits to working at Google, such as the cutting-edge technology and competitive salary, there are also downsides that should be considered. It is important for individuals to weigh these factors and consider whether the potential drawbacks of working at Google align with their personal values and priorities."

Software engineer,5.0,"Jul 19, 2018","Former employee, more than 3 years","Google is a world of its own. At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world.

There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away.

At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways.

Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all  employees.

A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world.

I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in.

Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics.

Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution.

The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own.

Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.)

To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at.

An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than  working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.)

For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting.

Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing.","If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.

Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.

Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war.""

A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.

There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.

Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.

There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro.

Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.

If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.

You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning."

Administrative business partner,5.0,"Apr 18, 2024","Former employee, more than 5 years","Pros for Google as a company:
- PERKS! Absolutely incredible perks. Just to name a few, free meals and snacks, $2000 technology reimbursement when covid hit, commuter cards for metropolitan cities, medical plan with $1000 added by google each year so your deductible is really only $200 annually and then the rest you only need to pay 10% of medical bills, and finally working from home flexibility (I was fully remote since 2020)

Pros as an Administrative Business Partner:
- working directly with and having an extremely close relationship with VPs, Directors, and Senior Managers at the company
- being able to be the go-to-person for hundreds of engineers (the folks that make up your assigned Directors teams)
- Traveling to different countries or offices for your directors summits
- Independent job that doesn't rely on anyone else, for the most part
- The pay: I made $130k annually (after 4 years of being an admin). To me, this is far above the industry standard","Cons for Google as a company:
- as most people have seen in the last few years, even at Google you're just a number. In 3 rounds of layoffs, folks weren't given any notice, they just woke up one morning to find that their access had been shut off. I don't blame google for doing this when they needed to layoff thousands of people, but just keep in mind that even at Google (in my opinion one of the best places to work) you're still just a number.

Cons about being an Administrative Business Partner:

- ""Girls Club"" energy: this is a female dominated role, thus there are a few cons specifically related to this. unfortunately the Admin teams i've worked with have always been chatty, gossipy, and not very tech savvy. These are what they call ""career admins."" Ex: women who started being an EA in the 80s or 90s before technology, and stayed in the role until their 40s and 50s. Not very good at their jobs, but unaware. 

- Ageist: being under 30 in this role means you'll never hear the end of the ""career admins"" unwarranted advice, or talking down towards you, despite the under 30 admins almost always being far better at their jobs than the admins over 40

- Promotions: getting promoted is specifically about who you know. the promotion committee is made up of senior admins, thus if you're not best friends with the admins on the committee, it will be much harder for you to get promoted. 

- despite this being an independent job that doesn't rely on the other Admins in your org, you're forced to attend unnecessary meetings with your fellow admins, which often times are full of gossip and ""back in the day"" chat."

Google Review: Cutting-Edge Work, Competitive Culture
Pros

Innovation at its Finest: Working on projects that push the boundaries of technology and directly impact millions of users is incredibly rewarding. Google fosters a culture of experimentation and encourages taking calculated risks.
Benefits Package Extravaganza: From on-site cafes with gourmet food to generous parental leave policies and healthcare benefits, Google takes care of its employees. The perks and wellness programs are truly top-notch.
Brilliant Minds, Collaborative Spirit: The caliber of talent at Google is inspiring. You'll be surrounded by intelligent, passionate colleagues who are always willing to help and share their expertise. Collaboration is highly valued, and there are many opportunities to learn from the best.
Cons

Fast-Paced and Demanding: Be prepared to work hard and adapt quickly. The environment is fast-paced, deadlines can be tight, and there's a constant push to achieve ambitious goals. This can be exhilarating, but it can also lead to burnout if not managed well.
Internal Politics Can Be Sticky: With such a large organization, navigating internal politics can be challenging. Getting projects approved or resources allocated can sometimes involve complex maneuvering.
Work-Life Balance: While Google offers generous time off, the demanding nature of the work can often lead to long hours and nights. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be a struggle, especially for those in high-pressure roles."

L4 software engineer,4.0,"Apr 25, 2024",Current employee,"- Prestige and Reputation: Being part of Google's workforce in any location carries a significant amount of prestige. Google is renowned for its innovative culture, cutting-edge projects, and attractive employee benefits. Working for Google in Edmonton can still provide you with access to these benefits while allowing you to live in a vibrant Canadian city.

- Work-Life Balance: Google is known for its emphasis on work-life balance and employee well-being. In a city like Edmonton, with its relatively slower pace of life compared to larger urban centers, you might find it easier to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Edmonton offers plenty of outdoor recreational activities, cultural events, and a strong sense of community, which can contribute to a well-rounded lifestyle.

- Opportunities for Growth: Despite being in a smaller location like Edmonton, Google likely offers ample opportunities for professional growth and career advancement. You may have the chance to work on exciting projects, collaborate with talented colleagues, and access training and development programs. Additionally, being in a smaller office might mean more visibility and opportunities to make a significant impact within the organization.","- Limited Networking Opportunities: Compared to larger tech hubs like Silicon Valley or even Google's main offices in cities like Toronto or Vancouver, Edmonton may offer fewer networking opportunities within the tech industry. This could potentially limit your exposure to new ideas, collaborations, and career advancement opportunities that often come from being in a more densely populated tech ecosystem.

- Smaller Talent Pool: Edmonton, while a thriving city, may have a smaller pool of tech talent compared to larger cities. This could impact team dynamics, project scalability, and the overall competitiveness of the office. Additionally, attracting top talent to relocate to Edmonton might be more challenging compared to more prominent tech hubs, which could affect the diversity and skill level of the workforce.

- Potential Isolation from Corporate Headquarters: Being located in Edmonton might mean a degree of isolation from Google's corporate headquarters and the core decision-making processes. This could lead to a sense of detachment or feeling out of the loop regarding company-wide initiatives, strategic direction, and access to resources that are more readily available at the main offices."

As a result, hiring process takes minimum 3 months (usually closer to 4/5 months) for a req to close and the recruiter really can't control this timing much. This makes it hard to keep candidates happy and difficult to meet quarterly goals since making each hire often takes longer than a quarter. - Some hiring managers can be tough to work or exhibit an elitist attitude; hard to convince some to follow inclusive hiring steps since they will have such a clear idea of the ""type"" of candidate they want. In general: - You really are just a number while working at Google. It's possible to build strong relationships and not feel this during the day to day, but leadership makes it clear. Examples: Lay off method was cold and not based on employee impact or performance. Leadership will remove benefits without warning, such as being able to work remotely. - Upward and internal mobility is extremely difficult. Promos take years and applying for internal roles is very competitive, so make sure you're prepared to stay in the role you're hired into for 3-4 years before even being looked at for mobility."

It's been over a year of not even be able to get a monitor or a laptop. You know it's bad when they stop hardware refreshes and force everyone to use a Chromebook because they choose not to afford a $2000 Windows or Mac machine while paying their people allegedly the top ""10%"" of the industry.

Half of the time we are struggling about which one is the ""source of truth"" and chasing after our own tails and the other half of the time spent in meetings (no agenda, just people talking as if they know everything), and the actual work (if you do want to do so) eats into your life. Middle management has no clue about what the real work is, and pays no interests in understanding it. Just busy working upwards themselves and change strategy without any base, or consistency from before. HQ pays no/little attention outside of California, the rest of the world doesn't exist for them. No perks, must show your name in any of the all hands meetings if you want to ask questions, no ownership, no processes, no procedures, just a lot of talks...

You're working on big & important projects for your clients. High pressure all the time. Since Google attracts the best of the best, it's easy to get impostor syndrome and feel like you don't belong.

Software development engineer (sde),5.0,"Feb 17, 2024",Former employee,"Search Engine: Google's search engine is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, in the world. It provides users with fast, relevant, and accurate search results, helping people find information quickly and efficiently.

Gmail: Gmail is a popular email service offered by Google. It provides users with ample storage space, powerful search capabilities, and integration with other Google services, making it a preferred choice for many individuals and businesses.

Google Maps: Google Maps is a comprehensive mapping service that offers detailed maps, satellite imagery, real-time traffic information, and turn-by-turn navigation. It helps users navigate unfamiliar places, find local businesses, and plan routes efficiently.

YouTube: As the world's largest video-sharing platform, YouTube allows users to upload, share, and view a wide variety of videos. It has become an essential source of entertainment, education, and information for millions of people around the world.

Google Drive: Google Drive is a cloud storage and file synchronization service that allows users to store, access, and share files and documents from any device with an internet connection. It offers generous storage space and seamless integration with other Google services.

Android: Google's mobile operating system, Android, powers the majority of smartphones and tablets worldwide. It offers a customizable and user-friendly experience, a vast ecosystem of apps, and regular updates and security patches.

Innovation: Google is known for its commitment to innovation and pushing the boundaries of technology. From self-driving cars to artificial intelligence research, Google has invested in a wide range of projects and initiatives that have the potential to positively impact society.

Free Services: Many of Google's services, such as Search, Gmail, Maps, and Drive, are offered to users for free. This accessibility has democratized access to information and communication tools, benefiting people around the world, especially those in underserved communities.

Developer Tools: Google provides developers with a wide range of tools and platforms, such as Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, and TensorFlow, to build and deploy applications, websites, and machine learning models.

Corporate Culture: Google is known for its unique corporate culture, which emphasizes innovation, employee empowerment, and a fun working environment. It offers numerous perks and benefits to its employees, fostering creativity and collaboration.","While Google offers numerous benefits and services, there are also some criticisms and concerns associated with the company. Here are some potential cons of Google:

Privacy concerns: Google collects vast amounts of user data through its various services, including search, Gmail, YouTube, and more. This data collection raises privacy concerns, as users may feel uncomfortable with the amount of personal information being collected and analyzed by the company.

Data security risks: With so much personal data stored by Google, there is always the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. While Google invests heavily in security measures, no system is completely immune to attacks.

Monopoly power: Google's dominance in various markets, such as search engines, online advertising, and mobile operating systems, has raised concerns about its monopoly power. Critics argue that this dominance stifles competition and innovation, potentially harming consumers and smaller competitors.

Algorithm bias: Google's search and recommendation algorithms have faced criticism for potentially promoting biased or misleading information or favoring certain websites or viewpoints over others. This can have implications for public discourse and democracy.

Lack of transparency: Google's algorithms and decision-making processes are often opaque, leading to concerns about accountability and transparency. Users may not fully understand how their data is being used or how search results are generated.

Tax avoidance: Like many multinational corporations, Google has been criticized for its tax practices, including using various legal loopholes and offshore tax havens to minimize its tax obligations in certain jurisdictions.

Environmental impact: Google's data centers and other operations consume significant amounts of energy, contributing to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. While Google has taken steps to improve its environmental sustainability, concerns remain about its overall impact on the planet.

Censorship and government cooperation: Google has faced criticism for cooperating with authoritarian governments to censor information and suppress dissent, particularly in countries like China. This raises ethical concerns about the company's role in facilitating censorship and human rights abuses."

I never felt challenged during my entire time there. My org's management was absurd. They tried to grow our team by 10x in two years and got the integration problems you'd expect. They kept trying to add more senior engineers, even when they didn't have enough work for the ones they had. Engineers would fight to steal projects from each other. Internal reviews all say to avoid working in Google Cloud though; it's not as friendly as the rest of Google. Layoffs are a sign the company is bad hands. They're saying they don't expect to need 12,000 people for at least 2 years.

There's a large degree of tiptoeing around under-performers. While there's a lot of investment in upskilling, there's often not a lot of skin in the game. Why would I want this?

On the one hand, the benefits are as great as you would expect from a tech giant like Google. In addition, the overall work environment is positive, as colleagues are generally friendly, supportive, motivated, and intelligent.","The job itself can be a strange one. A lot of time is spent creating work for yourself, as opposed to actually doing the work necessary to grow clients. Google, especially GBO, is very overstaffed, which leads to a lot of weird gamesmanship to try to get promoted. This includes making up weird groups, pointless sales initiatives, taking credit for things that just happen as opposed to being the result of actual effort on the part of the sales staff. As a result, people are rewarded not necessarily for their ability to sell, but for how well they can play the corporate game at Google. In other words, how well they are able to present themselves to management as the ideal Google employee, as opposed to actually being effective at selling."

Collaborative Culture: Google fosters a culture of collaboration, where team members are encouraged to share ideas and contribute to projects. This created a positive atmosphere where diverse perspectives were valued, leading to creative and effective marketing strategies.

Learning Opportunities: The role offered numerous opportunities for professional growth and skill development. Google invests in its employees through training programs, workshops, and access to a wealth of resources, ensuring continuous learning and adaptation to the ever-evolving marketing landscape.","Fast-Paced Environment: While the fast-paced environment is invigorating, it may not be suitable for everyone. The high expectations and quick turnarounds can be challenging for those who prefer a more relaxed work pace.

Work-Life Balance: Achieving a healthy work-life balance can be challenging due to the nature of the industry and the company's commitment to excellence. It's crucial for employees to proactively manage their time and set boundaries to avoid burnout.

Communication Challenges: Given the size and complexity of the organization, communication can sometimes be a challenge. Improved communication channels and tools could enhance cross-team collaboration and project efficiency."

Some of the teams I was in were plain awesome, and I made great friends for life. The offices are good, the pay is good, the perks are good.. I guess those are the reasons why I stayed that long.","It will heavily depend on the team you're in.. It can feel huge and disorganized, and I often felt like my role was not needed and/or I had to justify to management or leadership why my role or team existed in the first place. Process can range from non-existent to ridiculously complex. As they say, Google is the place where hard things are possible and simple things (like getting your new hire their badge) can seem impossible sometimes..

Besides, it has a good reputation (AFAIK) but it doesn't always live up to it (e.g. don't be surprised to find a fair share of awful colleagues, or about the fact that diversity and inclusion are not so great...) and that was often disappointing for me."

They also let people give honest feedback, but it's very rare that they care about it, hold anyone accountable, or change. The company responds better to outside criticism and competition.","The arrogance, but it is really team specific, but horrible in the new DMA (data, management, analytics) org which supports sales advertising. The company is not full of geniuses, which is the propaganda. Some people do get through because they are allowed to fail up, just like with any other company, hired to not be a threat to their manager, or just because they can convince some people that the nonsense they share makes sense if they say it fast and with confidence. This arrogance is not coming from top university graduates, which is the assumption, but those whose talents are limited to working at Google, so they love to brag about their tenure without even reading the room to see if there is anyone listening who cares or would just rather focus on working.

The company has recently done more internal surveys on sentiment and many results fell in the 70 percentage range and senior leaders spun this as positive because it's technically the majority -- sure it's limited by the response rate, but many people eerily believe that the company is a utopia, so I would think the people who would give higher ratings would make sure to respond as well.

DMA lies about the analytical lead role, so if you are a data scientist or work in analytics, you don't want to do this role if that's what you think you'll do more of. You spend more time managing internal egos and explaining to people internally that you have different jobs (the job titles are different, but many people still don't understand). And there is much less movement across teams now as they are still trying to make the company lean and manage/bully people out.

The company gives major cult vibes, which makes sense since it was founded in a top cult producing state. (I know it's not ""really"" a cult.)"

There are challengenging and interesting projects in Google in principle.","Depending on the team, the employee experience can vary drastically from excellent to extremelly bad. Late meeting, pings, etc are unfortunately quite common. Internal mobility opportunities were always very limited in Dublin office - basically your only options in engineering are to transfer between different SRE Teams, not comparable to USA. However, after more recent events, it became next to impossible. A lot of teams are not open to working remotely or even working from a different office on permanent basis. Getting things done is next to impossible without a meeting. Working via emails, tickets, docs is basically not an option, which is another reason why working remotely in Google is quite difficult. Meetings tend to be quite inefficient as well."

Management expects deadline to be met even with frequent last minute changes.
Even if you achieve target and expectations, growth and increment are negligible, better to stay in proper hardware company where learning and growth are consistent.

Accelerated growth consultant,1.0,"Feb 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Beautiful office, great food and snacks, equity, healthcare, gym, pool, often flexible, good products","Our supervisor consistently engages in bullying behavior toward me and my colleagues on a daily basis. These instances primarily occur in private settings, away from the observation of others. The effects of this behavior have been detrimental to several team members, with some opting to take extended leaves due to the resulting exhaustion and negative impact on their mental well-being and job performance.
The supervisor's actions convey a disregard for the feelings of others, often dismissing legitimate concerns and even insinuating that individuals are irrational or unstable. Additionally, he exhibits favoritism, unfairly criticizing certain individuals for minor issues while deliberately overlooking similar behavior in others. His conduct extends to performance evaluations, where he unjustly assigns poor ratings and misrepresents the feedback of team members.
The supervisor targets individuals he holds personal grudges against, burdening them with unmanageable workloads and creating situations designed for failure, only to shift blame onto the affected individuals. His relationship with the Director appears to be built on favoritism and ingratiating behavior rather than merit.
Proving these actions is challenging due to their clandestine nature and the supervisor's adeptness at manipulating information. Numerous employees have either resigned or attempted to leave the team due to his behavior.
Potential new recruits should exercise caution, as they may either become favored by the supervisor or endure daily suffering in silence. For HR personnel, intervention is imperative to prevent further attrition. To those experiencing similar mistreatment, I encourage you to bravely report such behavior to HR. Google removes bad reviews like this one to protect themselves on the outside but in the inside its unfortunately like this.
Its hard to get promoted or move in the org as you would have to be close friends with the managers or the right people."

Try and fail fast mentality leads to many issues as the company's scale can no longer support such an attitude - Entreprenuerial to an extent that there is very little support as you are new to the firm. This organization is a monster of its own to navigate - unlike any in the industry. Without the nature of guidance that initial googlers could access because of smaller scale, many nooglers struggle - Touts as being OKR driven but at a closer look you can see that there is intense data manipulation and storyline projection to show that they met OKRs. OKRs are often shifted - sometimes at the end of the review cycle - contrary to public image, they prefer only aggressive type As and it is sometimes upsetting to see the level of politics that exists - There is no diversity w.r.t personality types. If you are in with the cool crowd - you are in. Else you will struggle."

The working environment is cozy and welcoming on-site, to start with. With lots of natural light and pleasant working areas, the workplace is well-designed and cozy. In addition, cafeterias and micro kitchens serve delicious meals! It's wonderful to have access to wholesome and delectable meals all day long. The ability to work from home a couple of days a week is another major benefit. This is fantastic for days when I need to concentrate on specific tasks or simply want a change of environment. In terms of work-life balance, the employer is also generally supportive, which is a significant positive.","There are many meetings, which is one drawback of working here. I sometimes feel like I work on my tasks less and spend more time in meetings. There may also be a ton of work to complete, which can occasionally be overwhelming. Even with the support of the team, it may be difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance as a result. In conclusion, I would suggest Google to anyone looking to work as a data analyst. Although there are undoubtedly certain things that could be done better, I believe that the good outweighs the bad."

From virtual workshops to e-learning, the easy-access education is all at your fingertips. The great thing about this training is that you can be in control.","Customer Service RepresentativeAt a large company, there are usually more opportunities to grow.

Talented Peers: One of the highlights of working at Google is the opportunity to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the tech industry. The level of talent among peers is exceptional and inspiring.","Workplace Culture Concerns: My experience has highlighted significant issues in Google's workplace culture. Instances of bullying and unprofessional behavior, particularly from certain management personnel, drastically impact employee morale and mental well-being.

Lack of Transparency in HR Processes: There is a notable lack of transparency in human resources practices. Issues like deceit and misrepresentation in internal communications and employment termination processes raise serious concerns about ethical practices within the company.

Inadequate Conflict Resolution: Google's approach to handling internal conflicts and employee grievances seems lacking. The escalation of issues could be better managed, and there appears to be a need for more effective resolution strategies.

Questionable Hiring and Project Disclosure Practices: There seems to be a gap in how project details and role expectations are communicated during the hiring process. This lack of clarity can mislead potential new hires about the nature of their work and the tools they will use.

While Google remains a bastion of technological innovation and offers a platform to work with highly talented individuals, there are pressing issues within its workplace culture and HR practices that need to be addressed. Fostering a more ethical, transparent, and respectful work environment would greatly enhance the overall employee experience."

Staff program manager,1.0,"Mar 4, 2023","Former employee, more than 5 years","Benefits and comp are great, people are typically intelligent and dynamic","Google likes to think it's still a fast moving tech company, but in reality it is political and bloated. The net effect of that is that it has all of the worst of both worlds: working at a start up (custom tools, lack of process, lack of testing) and working at a huge company (bureaucracy). The worst part of Google, though, is the way that it ""motivates"" employees. The Perf system encourages individual contributions to the point that its hard to be efficient and collaborate. Everyone is doing things just to put it on their Perf. Work life balance is also a joke, no matter how many wellness bonuses they give us. Even though you technically don't need to kill yourself, they use promo to push you to work ridiculous hours. If you're not looking to get promoted (anytime soon), leadership doesn't know how to motivate you otherwise. People who push back on only working 100% of the time are seen as ""not a team player"". Don't be fooled - free lunches, remote work setups, and massages are just ways to keep you overworking."

Account manager,2.0,"Nov 25, 2023","Former employee, more than 3 years",Great colleagues. Upward movement with the right connections.,"Regarding Google's interview and sourcing process, there have been allegations of racial bias and a biased treatment of diverse applicants. Disturbingly, reports indicate that sourcers may have been instructed to exclude or disadvantage African American candidates intentionally. This behavior is deeply troubling and completely unacceptable.

An alarming instance of this bias was witnessed when a friend submitted her profile for a role. Initially rejected when her race was marked as ""black,"" she later changed her race to ""white"" and was immediately contacted (using the exact same resume). This is an appalling example of racial discrimination within the hiring process.

It is imperative that Google takes swift and decisive action to address and rectify these racist practices. They must commit to creating an inclusive, fair, and unbiased interview and sourcing process that allows all candidates, regardless of their race or ethnicity, to be evaluated fairly based on their qualifications and abilities.

As a globally recognized and influential company, Google has the responsibility to set an example of equality and inclusivity in the workplace. Failure to address these concerns adequately tarnishes their reputation and undermines the principles of diversity and fairness that should be upheld."

Leaders: we do not have real leaders, we have people who in the earliest and least experienced parts of their career were lucky enough to land at Google and never left. Our CEO is not a business leader by training. Our CMO has had her job for over 20 years (red flag). Our CPO is MIA because we operate in such silos. Career: Join Google if you want to be severely under-leveled, have your experience minimized, be patronizingly led by people less qualified and less experienced than you, and have near zero prospects for upward mobility. Future: This company has no strategy. All you have to do is follow the news to see Google as a company woefully out of touch with the rest of the world. We have no clue how to do marketing, which is obvious from Bard to the graveyard of things we've killed off.

Google has departments working on formulas meant to pay you as little as possible. Huge fight to get to the top - everyone is in a race. A culture of overachievers, which means you have to sacrifice personal and social life to move up the ranks. I've seen amazing rates of burnout among marketing. Too much. Also, middle management can be incompetent or too busy racing to the top to care about you. Everything is in formulas, and just doing a great job is not enough. You need to shop yourself and shout about your achievements as loud as you can in order to get promoted. Also, the commute from the city sucks. Oh, and the company's product strategy is a laughing stock. Google jumps on every shiny object. It's one thing to reinvent an industry, but to launch clones is just low. Google+ is shoved down everyone's throat. Google Offers was a Groupon clone. And nobody cares about the user, the company is totally evil. Decisions are made based on $$$, and not the user in mind.

During this period, a huge middle management layer emerged with Directors, VPs or SVP hired externally. Apart of the typical problems of having 8-10 managers, those new hires shifted the culture of the company. Rather than being data driven and caring, a more top-down, your regular big-corp mindset began to emerge. Not saying that those people with their experience (in e.g. cloud) are not necessary for economic success, but the legendary google culture and philosophy died around 2019 / 2020.

With just the profits from last quarter, they could've paid these employees for 10 years. In a heartless, gutless move, google laid off without warning and seemingly at random people who had been at the company for possibly decades by sending them an email. They didn't even let those employees communicate with their former teammates to say goodbye. Simultaneously, they left thousands of non-US employees around the world uncertain about their futures, in many cases facing the possibility of deportation due to their visas being tied to their employment. They destroyed employee morale and trust in them. And to top it off, they attempted to gaslight us in an embarrassing town hall with leadership, giving non-answers to legitimate questions and pretending that the layoffs were a necessity. This is demonstrably a lie. Do not make important life choices based on this company. Do not move internationally and assume that if you do a good job in a core team that you will maintain your job.

There's this manager who joined us from Meta, and since their arrival, things have taken a rather frustrating turn. The whole vibe has shifted towards this silent but noticeable micromanagement style. Sadly, this has driven some of our team members to decide to leave the company. It's a bit like a lottery here – you might end up in a team with a fantastic manager, but in the case of the Accelerated Growth team, well, let's just say we've hit a rough patch. You see, the leader of our team happens to be an old colleague of the team director from Meta. This dynamic seems to grant them a bit too much leeway, enabling some rather manipulative behaviors to go unchecked. Imagine having one-on-one meetings where you're made to feel like everything you do is wrong and your worth is questioned. Meeting targets? That's hardly the concern, it seems. You're kind of made to feel like the lone ranger, and it's disheartening. This sort of subtle bullying has driven some great folks to leave what they once considered their dream job. Interestingly, it's not just a one-off thing. A bunch of us have noticed this disturbing pattern and tried to raise the flag with HR. But, well, it's like our voices are falling on deaf ears – they don't seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation. The manager, by the way, seems to have a Jekyll-and-Hyde thing going on. One persona when others are around, and then this totally different one in those one-on-one meetings behind closed doors. There's been some pretty personal bullying too, which is just disheartening. Now, about the whole job itself – it's a bit of a strange deal. We're supposed to be these ""product specialists,"" but honestly, there's a complete lack of training when you join the team. Day in, day out, it feels like we're in this mad dash to chase customers and hope they'll throw more money our way. Yet, we're expected to pretend like we're experts on the products, even though we've been left in the dark. It's starting to feel like we've become this sort of fancy call center, and the stress is just off the charts. Sadly, that distinct ""Googlyness"" that used to define us seems to have faded away here. Oh, and let's not even get started on the compensation. It's definitely not keeping up with the times. My journey here at Google, which started with so much excitement, has now turned into something really draining. So, if you're considering joining this particular team for a Nordic language, I'm here waving a bright red warning flag – steer clear. Seriously, consider yourself warned! By the way, your typical day here involves a whole lot of customer chasing, with fingers crossed that they'll open up their wallets a bit more. You kind of have to put on a show like you're the product guru, even though there's been zero training on that front. In essence, it's like an overhyped call center scenario."

At some degree, you have some flexibility in regards of working hours.","Many times, projects shift course and suffer changes in prioritisation. Usually there is a constant pressure of delivering over your ability or bandwidth as a team. Many employees complain and have been complaining that they have experienced multiple examples of poor management and leadership. Employees have little possibility of being promoted to the next level - you have to perform top-notch on your current level, while getting involved in additional activities that are not part of your responsibilities and/or perform part of the next level responsibilities at the same time (for long periods of time). All of that only to be at least supported by your manager for a nomination and to be considered by the evaluating committee for eligibility for the next level. There are multiple cases in which employees complained about selective treatment - employees not being offered any pay raises for multiple years, discrepancies between the time that some employees come to the office, and the time that they leave in relation to others, etc. The work tends to become a simple routine, doing the same thing everyday. Cross-team communication is extremely broken - there have been multiple times in which information from stakeholders or other teams working on the same project has not been received by our team, or it has been provided in the last couple of sprints although we were already pressed by the release schedule. Also, there was usually a lack of organising important data - PRDs were not available, you would need to build features based on a slideshow or tickets with minimal technical requirements, etc."

If you said something wrong in the eyes of todays cancel culture, you would be ostracized. If you didn’t fit the mold, you’d be ostracized. Overall the development of talent was non existent. The training structures were outdated, and the middle management had too many team members to give any help to upskilling new hires. To the point that most would just slip through the cracks.

Remember, your experience at Google will depend on your specific role and team, so it's essential to consider how these points align with your goals.","While there are numerous benefits to working at Google, like any job, there are also some potential downsides. Here are some cons to consider: 1. **Intense Competition:** Google is highly competitive, which can lead to a fast-paced and demanding work environment. 2. **High Expectations:** The company's reputation for innovation can lead to high expectations and pressure to consistently deliver outstanding results. 3. **Bureaucracy:** As a large company, Google can have layers of bureaucracy that might slow down decision-making processes. 4. **Workload:** Due to the company's ambitious projects, employees might face heavy workloads and tight deadlines. 5. **Constant Change:** Google frequently updates products and strategies, which can lead to shifting priorities and uncertainty in some roles. 6. **Privacy Concerns:** Google's business model relies on data collection, which has led to privacy concerns and ethical considerations. 7. **Limited Work-Life Balance:** Despite efforts, some roles at Google may still demand long hours and potentially impact work-life balance. 8. **High Standards:** The company sets high performance standards, and those who don't meet them might feel pressure or scrutiny. 9. **Geographical Relocation:** Some roles might require relocation to specific offices, which could be challenging for individuals with family or personal commitments. 10. **Lack of Autonomy:** In certain roles, employees might have less autonomy due to the company's structure and decision-making processes. It's important to remember that experiences can vary widely depending on the specific role, team, and personal preferences. Conduct thorough research and weigh the pros and cons against your own career goals and priorities before making a decision."

Employees have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects, explore new technologies, and contribute to products that shape the future of technology. Learning Opportunities: The company encourages continuous learning. Google offers various training programs, workshops, and resources that allow employees to enhance their skills and stay updated with industry trends. Prestige and Brand: Being associated with Google adds a significant boost to your professional profile. The company's reputation and brand recognition can open doors to future career opportunities. Compensation and Benefits: Google is known for offering competitive salaries, bonuses, and comprehensive benefits packages. These may include health insurance, retirement plans, stock options, and more. Work-Life Balance: While tech jobs are often associated with long hours, Google places a strong emphasis on work-life balance. The company provides flexible working hours and, in many cases, the option to work remotely. Diverse and Inclusive Culture: Google strives to create an inclusive work environment. The company values diversity and promotes an open and accepting culture that can make employees feel welcome and respected.","Intense Competition: Working at Google means being surrounded by exceptionally talented individuals. This can lead to a high-pressure environment and a sense of constant competition. Bureaucracy: Like any large organization, Google has its share of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes might be slower, and navigating through the hierarchy can sometimes be challenging. Workload and Expectations: While work-life balance is emphasized, the workload can still be demanding, particularly during critical project phases. The expectation to deliver top-notch results consistently might lead to stress. High Standards: Google sets high standards for its products and services. While this drive for excellence can be motivating, it can also lead to perfectionism and frustration if projects don't meet these standards. Constant Change: The tech industry evolves rapidly, and Google is no exception. Employees need to adapt to frequent changes in projects, strategies, and technologies, which might not suit everyone's preferences.

They'll pay you great while you're here. But if you're not a L5+ person in Recruiting, then you're about as expendable as they come.","It's a huge company and there is a LOT of bureaucracy. You have to do more work than is necessary to get people hired. There are about 10 steps it takes and around 2 - 3 months to get anyone hired. They say this is to 'mitigate bias' but at the end of the day, the hiring committee just ends up making a biased hiring decision anyway.

This may decrease over time, now that the company is becoming more conventional. - Relatively easy to switch teams when you get bored of what you're doing. This is surprisingly rare. - Most teams really do believe in work/life balance, and that you do your best work when you actually enjoy the work. - Bottoms-up nature means that individual teams and team members have a lot of freedom and influence. - Senior leadership still shows signs of brilliance--the company managed the worst of Covid with compassion and thoughtfulness. - Still less evil than many other tech companies. Thankfully no longer in social networks. Tends more to open standards than Apple. - Basically, even though Google isn't nearly as good as it used to be, the other big tech companies seem really unappealing.","- More conventional and profit-driven every year, causing leadership to abandon early principles. - It smells like the CFO is calling the shots rather than the CEO. - Increasing distrust between senior leadership and the workers. Partly this is because the company grew too large, and then felt it had to do layoffs. - Lack of inspiring vision from senior leadership. ""AI, AI, AI."" AI is a technology, not a vision. Pichai would be a great COO, but not the right CEO. - Bottoms-up nature means there's a lot of duplication, wasted effort, and just plain old bad ideas.

Here are some examples: Restaurant review: I had a great meal at this restaurant! The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was inviting. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience. Hotel review: I stayed at this hotel for a business trip, and I was very impressed. The room was spacious and comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect. I would definitely stay here again. Store review: I went to this store to buy a new pair of shoes, and I was very happy with my purchase. The shoes were well-made and comfortable, and the staff was helpful and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone looking for new shoes. Service review: I had my car serviced at this shop, and I was very pleased with the service. The mechanics were friendly and knowledgeable, and they did a great job on my car. I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone looking for car service. Product review: I bought this product online, and I'm very happy with it. It's exactly what I was looking for, and it's working great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a similar product. These are just a few examples of Google reviews. When writing a Google review, it's important to be clear, concise, and informative. You should also be honest and unbiased in your assessment of the business or product. By following these tips, you can write a Google review that is helpful to other users. Here are some additional tips for writing Google reviews: Start by describing your experience. What did you do at the business or with the product? What did you like or dislike? Be specific. Don't just say that the food was good or the service was bad. Give specific examples of what you liked or didn't like. Be fair. If you had a bad experience, don't be afraid to say so. But be fair and balanced in your assessment. Be helpful. Your goal should be to help other users make informed decisions. So, be sure to include all the relevant information in your review. Proofread your review before submitting it. Typos and grammatical errors will make your review look unprofessional. I hope these tips help you write Google reviews that are helpful and informative.","Sure, here are some cons of writing Google reviews: Your review may not be seen by many people. Google reviews are only displayed if a user searches for a specific business or product. So, if you're writing a review for a small business or a new product, it may not be seen by many people. Your review may be biased. It's important to be honest and unbiased in your assessment of a business or product. But, it's also human nature to be biased towards or against something. So, it's possible that your review will be biased, even if you don't mean for it to be. Your review may be deleted. Google has a policy of deleting reviews that are spam, abusive, or irrelevant. So, if you write a review that violates this policy, it may be deleted. Overall, the pros of writing Google reviews outweigh the cons. But, it's important to be aware of the cons so that you can write a review that is helpful and informative. Here are some additional cons of writing Google reviews: Your review may be used by businesses to promote themselves. Some businesses will use positive reviews to promote themselves, even if the reviews are not genuine. This can make it difficult to trust the reviews that you see. You may be harassed or threatened by businesses or customers. If you write a negative review, you may be harassed or threatened by the business or its customers. This can be a very unpleasant experience. It's important to be aware of these risks before you write a Google review. But, if you're willing to take the risk, you can help other users by writing honest and informative reviews .informative."

Partner engineer,3.0,"Jul 22, 2023","Former employee, more than 5 years","Google was my dream job for a long time and many people I've talked to in the industry will say the exact same thing to you. Google is such a household name it has become the verb to search for something on the internet. If you're reading this, you likely have some conception of what it means to work for Google and what an amazing experience it is. Google is a fantastic place to work and was, at the peak of my tenure there, hands-down the best job I ever had. To list some of the pros: - Work with genuinely brilliant people, most of whom are genuinely kind, hard-working, and most importantly a joy to work with. - Work on really cool products, offer really cool services, and learn a great deal while supporting them. I genuinely learned more from my experience working at Google than doing anything else in my life I could think of. - Potential to travel and experience amazing new things around the world. These are world-class experiences and you will have a genuinely fun time traveling for work - Free food and unlimited snacks and drinks that are delicious and one of the nicest perks - Each office is beautifully designed and unique making it fun to travel and go to as many as you can - Tons of opportunities to learn and grow your career at Google. Advancement truly seemed limitless and was mostly merit-based (self-advocacy was necessary but it wasn't time-gated to get promoted) - Accepting and open culture in my experience with a good deal of diversity though this varies a great deal by team I'm sure - Pay and benefits are good but not the best in the industry anymore though you get more out of the perks than just your base salary to compensate - Lots of awesome employee-run programs to participate in and socialize with people. These range from support groups for pretty much any demographic to fun stuff like video games and things","The problem with Google is that despite all of these perks, they come at a price. You slowly but surely (and sometimes not very slowly) have your life consumed by Google. You will love it until you absolutely hate it. There's no work-life balance. Every year at Google, I would hear about ways to improve work-life balance. Things will improve and get worse again. You find yourself starting to look at your email and messages the second you wake up, feeling like you're already behind, and then you work until you sleep feeling like you're way behind. The thing is you're not but there's always more work to do and the company makes sure to hire overachievers whose self-worth is entirely tied to their productivity so you'll feel guilty if you're not constantly producing what feels like the best work you've ever created. Getting into Google is a huge challenge and succeeding at Google is the same way with their performance review cycles. Performance reviews are very necessary to help calibrate and motivate people who are high performers and identify ways to help or resolve issues with under-performers. The problem is that these are all effectively peer-based and this can either help or hurt you depending on your relationship with your peers. You wind up working to improve your ratings rather than improve your work and the process is something that wears down on people more than other places I've seen. Google has tons and tons of internal tools, inside jokes, and other things that are really fun to be a part of but won't benefit you anywhere else outside of Google. If you leave Google, you'll find that you'll need to reteach yourself how to work anywhere else. It's a bit of a tech silo and so you'll find that you advance yourself a great deal in some ways but in others significantly less than you'd expect overall. Everything is org-dependent and team-dependent. If you have a good team at Google, it makes a huge difference. I've heard stories from other Googlers first-hand that are completely different in terms of experience that I've had and, to be honest, every story I've heard adds a new con I never experienced. Management and leadership cares less about you the further up in the chain they are to the point where your job will get erased over an email regardless of productivity or performance. None of them will take accountability despite their claims to the contrary. Google is effectively the same as any other company in terms of how they will treat you if it becomes disadvantageous for them. The company tomorrow and going forward is not what it was in the past and its golden years feel long gone now."

Lots of learning opportunities and great people there.,"I was impacted by the 12,000-employee layoff. I'm not upset about the decision. In fact, I think Google finally made the right decision after it made a series of bad decisions. The bad decisions came from management who decided to expand the workforce vigorously during the COVID bubble and those who had an unclear vision of what products to build. Unfortunately, most people who paid the price for these bad decisions aren't the ones who made them. If you were like me who believed that Google is a great company that takes care of its employees, think again. If Google can choose only one between shareholders and employees, now you know the answer. Nevertheless, I still think it's a nice company and would recommend it to anyone."

Your manager would tell you to do ABC, and their manager- your program manager - asks you why you made changes to a deliverable and to revert it to XYZ.

Senior program manager,2.0,"Jun 20, 2023","Current employee, more than 3 years","Google has been a great personal experience specially for someone who came from SaaS business where you often forget your basic courtesies and manners. Instead of getting straight to business Monday mornings where there are no pleasantries exchanged, Google rekindled the human touch in me. It truly invoked the spirit of checking on people and being more empathetic specially when someone failed to meet a deliverable. It also doubled my confidence to kick off anything I chose to do professionally, oddly by subjecting me to impostor syndrome- not once but twice in 3 years and mind you I do not suffer with lack of confidence. :)","I spent a good chunk of my career working for another tech company ranked top 10 in the world and smaller chunk at a smaller company in my 20 yr career. At both places the common feedback I labeled as a high performer often challenging my leaders to keep me engaged/productive so they didn't run risk of losing me. However Google has consistently missed to meet my expectations and every few months I am asked to be a ""facilitator"" and not a ""leader"" given my program management function. Its absolutely disheartening! Google is a very inclusive culture but this comes at a price of decision making also making people often feel they are in a hierarchical structure even if they are not. People often are very nice on your face but don't shy from giving a load of feedback to your boss versus directly working to challenge you. Weird! Managers on the other hand become middlemen between stakeholders and employees and often this becomes a full time job. So bottom line, if you are a high performer and action oriented your energy is probably more respected elsewhere. Please note, my experience is limited to Google Ads and perhaps its better in other orgs."

The company acted under the at-will law but the trade off of bumping up shareholder value at the expense of vulnerable people is something I now consider the purest corporate evil I’ve ever seen. Cutting off the corporate access in the middle of the night was demoralizing, degrading and demeaning like all 12K people were criminals. I understand the risk mitigation to avoid possible actions of disgruntled employees but come on, there were so many options they could implement and yet they preferred the evil way."

Be very selective about your first team because it greatly impacts how long you'll stay at Google. With the new GRAD ratings, it's effectively impossible to change teams, as you only get one rating for an entire year, based on which team you were on the longest. If you change teams, or even try to change teams, your manager can give you a poor rating for not completing goals that were scheduled for the end of the period. This can in turn lead to you losing your annual bonus or even the new team retracting their offer altogether. If your manager is bad, you won't last at Google, but sadly, they will."

Software engineer,4.0,"Jun 13, 2023",Current employee,"Prestige and reputation: Google is one of the world's most recognizable and admired companies. Being associated with Google can enhance your professional profile and open doors to future opportunities. Competitive compensation: Google is known for offering competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits packages to its employees. The company often provides perks such as stock options, bonuses, and healthcare benefits.

You can work on exciting projects that push the boundaries of technology. Learning and growth opportunities: Google encourages a culture of learning and personal growth. You can attend training programs, workshops, and conferences to enhance your skills and knowledge. The company also promotes internal mobility, allowing you to explore different roles and teams.

These include flexible working hours, on-site amenities like gyms and cafeterias, and paid time off.","InterviewIntense competition: Given Google's popularity, the competition for job positions can be fierce. The recruitment process is highly selective, and you may face stiff competition from highly skilled candidates. High expectations and pressure: Google is known for its high expectations and fast-paced work environment. The company sets ambitious goals, and employees are often expected to deliver exceptional results under tight deadlines. Workload and long hours: Some Google employees report long working hours, especially during critical project phases. The demanding workload can sometimes lead to high levels of stress and burnout. Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Google has bureaucratic processes and hierarchical structures that may slow down decision-making and hinder agility. This can sometimes make it challenging to implement changes or pursue innovative ideas. Lack of work-life balance in certain roles: While Google promotes work-life balance, some roles, particularly in highly demanding or time-sensitive projects, may require employees to work long hours or be on call during weekends or holidays. Limited job security: Like in any rapidly evolving industry, job security can be a concern. Restructuring, strategic shifts, or changing market conditions may lead to layoffs or reassignment of job responsibilities."

The company also provides many opportunities for career growth and development, with a focus on learning and skill-building.","However, some employees have mentioned that the company can be very competitive and fast-paced, which may not suit everyone's working style.

Overall, Google is a great place to work for those who thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and are looking for opportunities for growth and development."
Senior security analyst,4.0,"Jun 12, 2023","Current employee, less than 1 year","Joined Google via acquisition of Mandiant in Nov. 2022, which was shortly before the layoffs began in early 2023. Most (but not all!) Mandiant staff were retained despite the drastic cuts in headcount globally. As a result, our existing Mandiant stock packages continue to vest and pay out at $23/share, which was the acquisition share price, so that's why the stock figure here is inflated. My Google GSU's for 2023 are valued at roughly $40-50k (there will be slight fluctuations in share price throughout the year), while Mandiant RSU payouts will be about 40k. Benefits at Google are world-class in terms of 401k match, medical/dental/vision, student loan payment matching, legal perks (they have an attorney network similar to a medical network, and will help you find an attorney & cover costs of things like estate planning, closing costs on buying a house, prenups, personal contract disputes, traffic tickets, etc.).","Mandiant was very people-centric, so when you needed something, it was a matter of who you needed to talk to, and it wasn't hard to find the right person. At Google, it's impossible to operate the same way, given we are now part of an enterprise with about 100x our Mandiant's headcount. The beauracracy of corporate functions (legal, HR, payroll, recruiting, etc) is suffocating. We used to be nimble and quick at sorting out a lot of operational matters; things that took days now take 6-12 months. On the other side of the coin, Google's productivity expectations don't always suit the cybersecurity services industry very well. There is a huge push to bring new services to market, and to scale them faster and more aggressively than we ever would have done as an independent company. While the growth plan is admirable, in the security business rushing out a product or service that is incomplete or faulty can have severe ramifications. Bugs or process failings can lead to enterprise-scale clients having major security incidents, instead of just inconveniences for users of consumer products. It doesn't always seem like Google executives understand the gravity of this, or that their processes are not necessarily well-suited to sustaining or strengthening Mandiant's position as the world's leading cybersecurity firm. As a result, morale among the Mandiant teams is weakening. I suspect that as Mandiant stock bonuses finish paying out and the ""golden handcuffs"" loosen, existing staff will explore opportunities elsewhere unless they are given substantial raises and GSU refills. This will exacerbate existing headcount challenges, as hiring at Google is 5x slower than it was at Mandiant (cyber roles that used to fill in a month or two now take 6-10 months), and that will have negative ramifications for our clients. Also, the return-to-office campaign is crappy and tone-deaf. Google has exceptional corporate facilities around the world; let them do the talking for you, and the people who want to enjoy working in them will come back in on their own. If someone can't be convinced by all the free food & amenities, they won't be convinced by anything, so it's not worth belaboring the point and alienating those individuals. It's also really tone-deaf to push this on people whose job offers specifically were for remote positions, and who accepted the role with a clear understanding that they would not be required to appear in an office regularly."

Software engineer,5.0,"Jun 2, 2023",Former employee,"Prestigious company: Google is widely recognized as one of the leading technology companies in the world, and being a part of such an esteemed organization can enhance your professional reputation. Cutting-edge technology: Google is known for its innovative technology stack and tools. As a Software Engineer, you will have the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art technologies and contribute to groundbreaking projects. Challenging and impactful work: Google offers a wide range of projects and products, providing diverse opportunities to make a significant impact. As a Software Engineer, you can work on projects that reach millions of users worldwide, solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of technology. Collaborative environment: Google fosters a culture of collaboration and teamwork.

Career growth and development: Google provides numerous resources and opportunities for professional growth. They offer internal training programs, mentoring initiatives, and the chance to work on different projects or teams, allowing you to continuously learn and advance your career.","Intense competition: Due to the high level of talent and competitiveness associated with Google, the interview process can be challenging and rigorous. It may require extensive preparation and showcase exceptional skills to secure a position. Workload and pressure: Google's commitment to innovation and excellence can sometimes result in high workloads and tight deadlines. The fast-paced environment may require you to manage multiple tasks simultaneously and handle the pressure of delivering high-quality results within strict timelines. Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Google can have a certain level of bureaucracy, which may slow down decision-making processes and hinder agility. Navigating the internal processes and getting approvals may sometimes be time-consuming. Work-life balance: The demanding nature of the job and the drive for success at Google can sometimes make it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long working hours and occasional tight deadlines may require dedication and adaptability to manage personal commitments effectively. Limited impact on projects: In some cases, due to the large scale of projects and the hierarchical structure, individual contributions may be limited to specific components rather than having full ownership over an entire project. This can vary depending on the team and project you are assigned to."

Graphic designer,5.0,"Jun 1, 2023",Current employee,"I recently had the privilege of working as a graphic designer at Google, and I cannot express enough how exceptional the experience has been. From the moment I joined the team, I was immersed in a creative and inspiring environment that truly fostered my growth and allowed me to thrive. Here's my review of my time as a graphic designer at Google: Creative Freedom and Support: Working at Google as a graphic designer provided me with unparalleled creative freedom. The company truly values innovation and encourages its employees to think outside the box. I was given the opportunity to explore various design concepts, experiment with different styles, and bring my ideas to life. The support from my colleagues and superiors was remarkable, as they were always available to offer feedback, guidance, and encouragement. Cutting-Edge Design Tools: Google equips its designers with top-of-the-line design tools and software, enabling us to push the boundaries of creativity. Whether it was using Adobe Creative Suite or other specialized tools, I had access to the latest and most efficient software to enhance my design process. The company's commitment to providing the best resources is a testament to their dedication to excellence. Collaborative and Diverse Team: One of the highlights of working at Google as a graphic designer was the opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. The company places great emphasis on inclusivity and actively encourages different perspectives. This diverse team dynamic not only enriched my work but also fostered a sense of belonging and community within the workplace. Inspiring Work Environment: Google's work environment is second to none. The company's offices are designed to inspire creativity, with vibrant colors, comfortable workspaces, and innovative design elements. The overall atmosphere is lively, energetic, and conducive to productivity. Additionally, Google's commitment to employee well-being is evident through various perks, such as on-site fitness centers, healthy meals, and relaxation areas. Growth and Learning Opportunities: Google is dedicated to the professional development of its employees. As a graphic designer, I had access to a range of training programs, workshops, and seminars to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest design trends. The company also promotes internal mobility, allowing employees to explore different roles and expand their expertise. In conclusion, my experience as a graphic designer at Google was nothing short of exceptional. The company's commitment to fostering creativity, providing top-notch resources, and cultivating a collaborative work environment makes it an ideal place for any designer to flourish. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an innovative and inspiring team. I wholeheartedly recommend Google to any graphic designer looking for a dynamic and fulfilling work experience.","While my experience as a graphic designer at Google was mostly positive, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: Fast-paced environment with high-pressure deadlines. Bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes. Limited autonomy in design decisions due to data-driven approach. Intense competition among highly talented individuals. Limited flexibility in design styles due to brand guidelines. Overall, Google offers tremendous growth opportunities but requires adaptability and a willingness to work within established frameworks. Consider your preferences and work style before pursuing a graphic design position at Google."

Engineering manager,2.0,"May 25, 2023","Former employee, more than 5 years","In the past, the company offered a variety of benefits, however, many of these were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic and additional cutbacks were implemented seemingly without rhyme or reason. The compensation was impressive, particularly for those who had been with the company long enough to receive shares valued at less than $1000 before the stock split.","Even at its prime, Google experienced a high rate of management turnover at all levels. There was a time when I had been with the company longer than the combined tenure of the three levels of management above me, and this trend has only escalated since 2022. The process of rolling out a feature can be quite protracted, often taking months, due to the complex bureaucratic process of Ariane. Upper management occasionally introduces new initiatives with rigid deadlines, seemingly out of the blue. Reorganizations are a frequent occurrence. The caliber of managers varies widely, from exceptional to surprisingly subpar. The performance review processes used to stall company operations for weeks biannually. Although they've since been revised, the execution left much to be desired. Competition for resources and advancement opportunities is intense, leading to unfortunate instances of colleagues undermining each other either for personal gain or out of insecurity. There exist several large-scale systems that have been operational for years, yet no maintainer has a complete understanding even of just their part. Long-term projects are undertaken to rediscover and document this lost knowledge, only to be abandoned or lost due to turnover. A significant portion of engineering effort is directed toward continuous migrations. At one point, technical debt in Cloud had deteriorated so badly that a VP reprimanded the entire organization, and everyone received a badge as a reminder. YouTube's highly compartmentalized structure often overlooks opportunities that span across organizational boundaries. The quality of Chrome code has declined to such an extent that substantial parts need to be completely overhauled - inter-process communication and memory management are particularly problematic, but performance in general needs attention. Even the Search and Ads departments have not been immune to leadership-related issues."

If you start off well, you are given more opportunities and can continue to do well. If you don’t, you are given insignificant and uninspiring work which make it difficult or impossible to get a good performance review, and you will have trouble transferring to a team where you could do better. Sydney is very much a minor branch office - the range and ambition of local projects are minimal compared to headquarters. Layoffs are stressful for everybody regardless of the ultimate outcome, and a reminder that despite all the PR, you’re only there to make the shareholders rich."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"May 16, 2023","Current employee, more than 10 years",A beautiful mission statement A history of staying true to it,"In the last few years the culture has changed substantially: 1) lower hiring bar compromising either on GCA (general cognitive ability) or Googleyness (integrity, team playing ability and humility) which resulted in greater numbers of shark-behaviors, intimidation and manipulative behavior, generalized entitlement 2) worse HR function I’ve ever observed - as an example a product manager who was clearly not qualified, not meeting deadlines and writing PRDs that could never get signed off by stakeholders team as they weren’t on specs went on to demonize the project manager who was doing their job which was to keep the team on requirements and on time and to report on progress accurately . That product manager used sexual and violent language to describe their experience working with them. They fabricated quotes and 1:1 notes they falsely attributed to them which in real life you’d call defamation and smearing. The incidents were reported to HR, they concluded that this language was not a violation of code of conduct hence no sanction would be taken, because the words were used merely as analogies not direct threats and sharing widely your « opinions » about someone’s intent and what happened is freedom of speech. The HR person concluded the project manager shouldn’t be intimidated or inconfortable but was reminded they could see a therapist if they’re struggling with their emotions!?! When they mentioned that if google couldn’t provide a safe work environment they’ll have to either change team (career hit) or resign. The HR person responded it is your right to do so but remember we aren’t asking you to. As a reminder the code of conduct and the associated training do specify really clearly that even jokes that cross a line aren’t acceptable. When reminded of it, the HR person stated « the code of conduct is not meant to be applied literally ». 3) the culture at Google is getting extremely «woke » in a suffocating kind of way. DEI is a constant theme that is promoted so much so that if you aren’t from a minority group it’s almost understood you have to make yourself small and just be grateful to be here. In hiring I’ve heard manager state they’re « winning » at diversity when they managed to hire only women. I’m a woman and I find that disturbing hiring only women is by definition not diverse. And what happened to hiring the most qualified candidate regardless of how they look and sound. Similarly, I’ve heard comments about we’re going to purposely prioritize candidates who don’t come from our field (for a particular field) so … what do we say to field experts? Sorry but you’re too logical of a choice for this role so we can’t hire you, go do something unrelated and we’ll see. That’s backwards. 4) Intrusive well-being agenda. Another example is constant well-being (mandatory) activities during working hours. I value well-being but give us money for us to do it on our terms in our own time. I don’t find being « vulnerable on-demand » with strangers or colleagues to be particularly well-being inducing. Some people prefer to confide in well-chosen friends they’ve learnt to trust after years of getting to know each other. And not all of us like to do yoga at work. And let’s not mention the « personal well-being plan » where we’re telling employees from now on your manager is responsible for you being a responsible adult and doing what’s in your plan (eg. sleep 8 hours, eat your vegetables, take a bath). As a manager I find it incredibly out of place in a work environment and treating adults as if they were kids only makes them less accountable. Lack of accountability is a recurring problem at google 5) unfairness across regions. It’s anecdotal so take this with a grain of salt: with 2 masters and 3 years of experience in Europe you’ll start as level 2 whilst your American colleagues with a bachelor and no work experience will start as level 3. 6) meritocracy is over. I’ve had years of being the top performer in a team (equal level, higher rating) and yet was the lowest paid by ~20%, that gap was only addressed when I found out and raised it loudly. The recent shift to a GRAD system is now awarding the same rating to 80% of the company which is felt by many as gaslighting (ie. C and A are the same if you take a school analogy), what’s going to happen is either the A people who know A and C aren’t the same will move to a company that sees the difference (and it’s already happening) or they’ll start doing mediocre work since it gets you the same rewards and compensation. Not to mention the recent promotion cycle seemed to have been based on « time at level » (vs. impact as advertised) 7) low performance management. Countless of cases of low performers abusing the system and HR making it hell for managers to deal with the situation. Often not only not supporting them but instead guilting them or putting them on trial. As a result, managers are hesitant to give the deserved low rating by fear of signing up for 2-3 years of horrendous experience. As a result low performers are awarded a neutral rating and transferred endlessly. When there is a manager who’s daring to award the low rating (usually new managers who don’t know better), they usually either burn out or quit. In that case, I’ve seen many many cases of low performers going on medical leaves for years to avoid being held accountable. If they were from a minority group, I’ve seen that card being used against the manager (another reason why they’d be hesitant to award a low-rating as they might end up being targeted and accused of being racist, sexist, biased). As a result, it’s really common to have low performers who stay on for years delivering ~20% if what’s expected, while causing lots of churn (stakeholders friction, stakeholders complaints, manager spending up to 50% time on low performance management) 8) taking innovators and fast-performers for granted. There is no real mechanism to reward fast trajectories. Time a level has always been a gating criteria (and it seems now the main criteria?). Failure yo recognize talents is a shame. The most entrepreneurial, risk-taking and innovative people (usually capable of 10X ROI) are usually gravitating towards innovative teams. These are the 20% of the people who have the availability to deliver 80% of the value. For instance during the layoffs, area120 was laid off whereas these are precisely the profiles you’d have wanted to retain when entering a phase of fast competitive innovation race 9) entitlement. Because google treats their employees like babies who aren’t accountable for their choices and action, this leads to severely high levels of entitlement. For instance, your employee could come to you and claim they’d like to recast a substantial portion of their job to work on their passion project and tell you their well-being depends on it, and since as a manager you’re responsible for their well-being (and your reports rate you on that), you’re put into a corner. I don’t know of any other company where you can tell your boss I want to decide what the role I am receiving a salary should be. This leads to odd situations where you have team priorities unstaffed but people are paid doing what they « feel » like doing. Similarly it’s been very difficult to enforce clear roles and responsibilities because someone who might have been hired as a sales person wanted to be a product manager so starts acting as a product manager. In another company we’d say I hear you you’d prefer another time but the one you gave is X hence you’re expected to fo X, if you want to do Y, I can help you transfer. 10) decision making. Decision making is chaotic. Because we’ve led everyone to believe they’re entitled to decide everything. As a manager, you are (almost) expected to decide by consensus with your team. The system in place where your reports grade you and that scores conditions your own career results in a «dictatorship of the crowd » of some sort. A lot of managers will shy away from making hard decisions by fear of the backlash on their manager score (eg. project assignment, working norms, awarding ratings)."

Lower morale reviews by women and underrepresented employees at Google and higher turnover. The company has tried to improve this, but so much more needs to be done. - Executive/Senior management does not take responsibility for their actions and are out of touch with their employees. - Complete chaos inside with simple work being over-processed regarding work, performance reviews, promotions, etc. People are not recognized for their great, hard work, but rather, how well they get along with others and don’t rock the boat. - HR cannot be trusted, does the minimum amount of work required (and this goes all the way to the top), and protects senior management as their #1 priority. There are a few good HR employees, but even they are unhappy in the roles. - Over 12,000 employees were laid off so far in 2023 and many of them were high-performing employees and/or were recently promoted. Why would anyone want to work for a company that they would need to be looking over their shoulder all the time, working hard, just to get laid off because management didn’t do their job with properly planning? This goes all the way up to the CEO and his leadership team. They gave themselves massive long-term equity this year yet they are not held accountable with the company’s problems. They say “I take full accountability”, but it means nothing in the end. I had one of the worst managers of my career at Google . This person was a micromanager to their employees, insecure and only managed up. It was truly amazing that the company kept this VP around with such low PMR and Googlegeist scores. The morale in this organization was terrible. All we did was re-organize all the time. It was exhausting and I recently left for a more normal job where I am recognized for the good work that I’m doing and I’m now making a positive and meaningful difference in advancing tech. The company says that it has “Responsible AI,” but that is just a good marketing statement. Google has a small team that works on Responsible AI, but several of them were impacted with in the 2023 layoffs and the ethics team were let go. Google has a lot of talk around responsible AI, but at the end of the day, the Product Areas (PA’s) can do what they want and the engineers have full reign on decisions - unless Legal has to finally step in."

Program manager,3.0,"May 6, 2023","Former employee, more than 5 years","-Before the pandemic, Google's office perks were great. The free food, nap pods, and cool office layouts were especially impressive for those, like me, who had just graduated from college. 
-Google is known for its excellent support for permanent residency and visa sponsorship. They outsource to a top-notch legal provider to adjudicate cases, which makes a difference when working for a big company. 
-If you are lucky enough to get 20% opportunities or a good manager who allows you to expand your scope, you can learn new things and make a tangible impact on the organization.","-After the pandemic, the in-person collaboration went away, and the office perks became irrelevant. The company became remote-first, and if you wanted to maintain your salary, you were forced to move back or stay in the vicinity of HQ. Management would try to enforce those who did not come into the office to request remote, even though they did the same thing. -The level of red tape and bureaucracy is too high. 
-Poor management is a problem at Google. Managers are trying to become the next directors and VPs, but some of them lack the interpersonal and communication skills necessary for the job. 
-Overhiring during the pandemic led to bloated teams and favoritism from managers for scope and opportunities as the company shifted priorities. 
-Google touts a work-life balance culture, but managers can micromanage employees to complete everything before taking any time off, even sick time. It's not uncommon to be contacted during PTO by managers asking work-related questions or assigning action items. 
-Google has a reputation for hiring smart people, but I'm not sure what happened to the culture and level of the ""high bar"" to hire someone in the past couple of years..."

Your responsibilities may get big or small depending on the project but you will learn a lot about yourself, the team and the company while working.","Sadly its a contract position that is renewed every 6 months or so. Most contracts cap at around 2 years. There can be an option for conversion to FT but you would still need to go through the interview process again from Google. Understand this is a business need and ultimately when projects are successfully completed, your contract can end if there are no other projects to transition too."

How Google works is by making thousands of tiny incremental changes to dozens of products that no one cares about and which don't make the world a better place.

The reaction of top search leadership was essentially - well not according to our metrics. we'll keep on building search how we see fit. Then, chatgpt comes along and installed a new narrative - that it could do things better than Google. That narrative caught on, not because OpenAI has better tech or because chatGPT is a good product, but because Google has not addressed those earlier critics and has just been pushing their own vision of search."

Sales representative,4.0,"Mar 1, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year","People were impressed when I said I worked at Google - my mom told me she was proud me (LOL - I'm in my 50s). Office benefits were great at the time (before the 'rona) . Our office was a smaller office but breakfast and lunch were provided as were drinks and snacks. We also had 'mental health days' and some groups and 'no meeting weeks'. The no meeting weeks were stupid to be honest. Some office has a masseuse that you could schedule. Getting meetings with senior exec was easy, people are interested in what Google has to say or is doing. I never has such and easy time getting to senior staff. Google Cloud is impressive and is just a secure & robust (if not more so) as any other cloud. Google is also a cash printing machine so while I was there it there wasn't any cost cutting or anything like that. I really came to appreciate Google tools & productivity suite - they really work well. Salary & Benefits are very good, stock options were phenomenal.",The cons are a few but notable. First I would say that there was a big cultural transformation when I joined. Google was hiring a lot of enterprise sales & business leaders and many of the existing Googlers were vocally uncomfortable with it. Their bubble was being burst. Also Google had what I describe as a naive arrogance to itself. The attitude was 'our cloud is so good you'd be foolish not to use it and consume resources the way we think you should'. This lead to being several years behind AWS & Azure in the public sector market. I could go into great detail but suffice to say that Google is not the center of the cloud universe. This lead to being years behind AWS and sales were almost non-existant while I was there. Most of the people that joined when I did have moved on. At the time the comp plan only paid us on committed spend contracts which was an extra step in adoption and difficult to negotiate. Google tries to insert itself into national political discussion but comes off as hypocritical - probably best to avoid.

Engineering manager,4.0,"Feb 8, 2023",Current employee,"* Pay around the top of what you can get in big tech.

* Google still has most of the perks it's famous for. Solid food, entertainment options, gyms, interesting shared spaces. 

* The work is generally challenging - solving difficult problems at scale - but not super intense. Rarely have to work longer than 40 hours/week if you are good at setting your expectations. 

* Anyone who has been there since the mid 2010s or longer is likely to be a super smart, super kind person who is competent and a pleasure to work with.","* It increasingly feels like other big tech companies. The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions. 

* Hiring standards have plummeted with the rapid expansion starting in the late 2010s. Combined with the widely available materials and coaching for passing Google interviews, this has led to a lot more incompetent people getting into the company at all levels. 

* The company is agonizingly slow to fire people for performance reasons. This means if you have teammates, reports, or (the worse) managers who are incompetent, they could linger in their positions for a year or years being minimally productive -  or even actively counterproductive - before they are let go. 

* You'd often think the company was struggling to make ends meet, rather than profiting tens of billions of dollars per year. Perks are being suspended or cut, mass layoffs occurred without warning, and the already haphazard hiring pipeline has been frozen on and off. Upper management maintains that this is all the result of economic headwinds and long term strategy, versus propping up the wealth of the major shareholders."

The roles in gTech are for example Ad Solution Consultant, Support Specialist, Technical Account Manager, etc. 

+ Although your Org (gTech) is quite boring, you still have the Google brand and all the Google perks (insurance, food, gym, travel allowance, etc.)
+ Stock price and great stock package
+ Smart and interesting people","- gTech has small travel budget (e.g. I've never travelled to Mountain View in over 2 years to meet my teammates in person)  
- Your job performance is measured with hard 'call-center-like' KPIs (# Customer Contacts, Time for resolution, etc.)
- Big Org where everybody wants to get promoted ASAP to move to other teams, thus very difficult to get promoted within 2 years. 
- Decision making process is very slow (expect to take months and months to get approvals for the simplest projects)
- Project time has to be done in addition to your core work & metrics
- They hire people who are too smart & talented for their role. E.g. you are a full-stack Engineer, but do technical support. 
- Mid-Management and VPs in gTech do not show leadership and do not follow through on their words (e.g. preach 'take ownership' but force everybody to follow processes and meet certain support metrics)
- The core compensation (Base + Bonus) is relative low, but Google's high stock price is balancing the total comp."

20% time is a myth.  I suppose some people get to do that.  I don't know any personally as every group I've worked with is stressed and working hard on the project they're on.
At Google it was better to be early than good.    Being in the wake of a mass exodus of (mostly) young millionaires (many of whose first job was Google) and being handed their mediocre work to fix can really kill your incentive to ""go further"" here, especially when later senior folks are not well compensated equity-wise.

Principle software engineer,4.0,"Jan 23, 2023",Former employee,"Google used to be a really special place to work. Over the years, it's become more and more a typical large company.

A plethora of benefits, perks and competitive salary. Also, the opportunity to work with some really smart and driven people.","Google's fabled ""culture"" is all but gone and has been replaced by mind-boggling bureaucracy and rampant nepotism. In part due to the numerous acquisitions, that allowed people that would have never been hired by Google to join the company. These acquisition-employees bring their toxic culture with them, and dilute the very fabric of being ""Googley"".

Being at the mercy of Perf to get promoted. If a direct manager likes an employee, then it's a walk in the park, otherwise prepare to be stonewalled or have to resort to some serious brown-nosing to get ahead. Also, leveling-up gets super competitive due to the large size of the company. Transferring teams is a challenge, so most employees grin and bear it for a couple of years, or leave the company. It's hard for outsiders to understand, but this happens to a lot of Nooglers, and ""re-Noogler"" events are done  for employees that complete their first year. It's unfortunate, but after the ""rainbow-colored glasses"" come-off most new employees burn-out . Google seems to bring out the workaholic in people.
 
Politics among teams and Orgs slow everything down, often leading to delayed launches, buggy releases and zero transparency. Also, there's an awfully large amount of bad managers. Simply being great at a  job doesn't create a good manager, being a nurturing people-person that enjoys building amazing employees is more effective."

Sodftware engineer,4.0,"Jan 16, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year","I recently had the opportunity to work at Google and it was an incredible experience. The company culture is truly unique and fosters a sense of collaboration and innovation. The work environment is fast-paced and challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. One of the things that stood out to me during my time at Google was the level of expertise and knowledge of my colleagues. I had the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry and it was truly inspiring. The mentorship and guidance provided by my team leaders helped me to grow both personally and professionally. The company is also very forward-thinking when it comes to technology and is always pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It was exciting to be a part of such a dynamic and innovative organization. In terms of work-life balance, Google does a great job of promoting a healthy balance. The company encourages employees to take the time they need to recharge and focus on their well-being. Overall, my experience at Google was extremely positive and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an incredible organization. I highly recommend the company to anyone looking for a challenging, rewarding, and innovative work experience.","It is worth noting that working at Google can also have its downsides. The company is known for its fast-paced and high-pressure environment, which can be stressful at times. Additionally, the company's size and bureaucracy can make it difficult to navigate and get things done. It may also be difficult to get noticed or promoted within the company due to the sheer number of employees and the high level of competition. Another con could be the cost of living in the area where the office is located, it could be very high, which can be a challenge for some employees. It is also worth noting that the company's policies and practices have come under scrutiny in recent years, particularly in regards to issues such as privacy and censorship. While Google is committed to making positive changes in these areas, it is important to be aware of these issues and how they may impact your experience at the company."

- Quick learning curve and personal growth in first 1-2 years in Google.  
- Great Company name is the resume.","- Fast-paced environments actually means organizational changes every 6 months, and results in uncertainty and anxiety for personel

- Lot of internal pressure for promotion : each next level unlocks better salary and more interesting jobs within the company + people judge you based on a ""level"" you achieved. Yet, promotion process is not transparent, and visibility and politics plays a bigger role than performance itself. 

-  You might find yourself ""locked"" in a position you don't like, doing jobs that are below your expertise. Yet you wouldn't be able to move higher if you didn't got a promotion. This leads to burnout and loss of interest to the job. 

- Don't be fooled, Google is a corporation now.

Senior software engineer,5.0,"Feb 5, 2009",Former employee,"My time at Google was one of the most positive experiences I've had in my career.  I was with the company at a time of rapid growth, and the skills I developed in that fast-paced environment are skills that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.  The people that I worked with at Google are some of the brightest and talented individuals I have had the pleasure to meet.  I had heard that the compensation and benefit package they offer their employee's was legendary, and when I joined the company it didn't disappoint.  Google is doing some very cool things, and will have an immense impact on all of our daily lives for many years to come.  They truly are changing the world.","One of the the things that I felt the most was most difficult to deal with at Google was the competition for promotion within the organization.  While the talent of the team they have assembled at Google is second to none, it makes standing out amongst your peers that much more difficult, and it was ultimately the reason I decided to leave.  Google is not the place to work if you feel like you need constant reassurance about the quality of work you're doing.  Feedback from your superiors is not often given out, and a pat on the back for a job well done is simply not part of the culture, unless your accomplishments are astronomical."

- Some projects can involve working on very cool technology (as long as there's a clear plan to generate revenue, otherwise it gets axed).","Leadership is short-sighted, tone-deaf, and useless. All of the bizarre headlines published about Google to the outside world are just as baffling to the majority of employees inside the company.

Benefits and perks have been dramatically slashed, thousands of employees are fired without notice, culture-building events such as hackathons, knowledge-sharing social events, family events and holiday parties are all pretty much gone. Travel is mostly non-existent, except for executives and product VPs.

The company no longer appears to have any vision about being competitive in the future, and has gone all-in on a cost-cutting strategy to survive. C-level executives regularly respond in corporate double-speak about how they're ""taking responsibility"", while dodging questions that are critical of them or their decisions during TGIF (the company wide all-hands) and Town-Hall meetings. They continue to collect record-setting equity payouts, ignore critical feedback about company decisions and strategy, and have turned a blind eye to plummeting moral which is at an all-time 24yr low.

Some grass-roots efforts inside the company have even being to sprout in an effort to stop the bleeding and affect some sort of positive change, but these efforts are mostly hampered by the lack of transparency and the willingness of leadership to terminate employees without notice and for sketchy or ambiguous cause.

Confidence in leadership (all the way up to Sundar) is in an abysmal state, and there is no clear idea about how to make the company successful in the future. The luster of the roles it offers is quickly dissolving, and unless something incredibly dramatic happens at the leadership level, I wouldn't not expect Google to be an innovation leader in anything, within the next couple of years."

You can learn a lot here. I loved working on mapreduce infrastructure, the google implementation is years ahead of any implementation (hadoop etc)  and learned a lot.
It was incredibly easy to find a job after I left Google, my experience was valued very much by other companies.
Until very recent times Google was the best place to work on new innovative projects in any area from information retrieval and natural language processing to large scale distributed system. The infrastructure of datacenters is very impressive, very few companies can give you similar resources.
It's up to employee to decide how much time he spends in his office and how much time he works from home.
Food is free and many other benefits are available.","Google management is pretty bad. Many cool innovative ideas from engineers were ""killed"" by managers because they were unable to understand their importance. Projects similar to facebook and yelp were made in google long time ago and they did not start and succeed because of management failure. Top management never understood importance of social and local until very recent time.
Promotion system is really bad. I was glad to get my promotions but many people are very unhappy. There is no fair system to evaluate quality and amount of your results. Basically, everything depends on your manager, he likes you, you are doing very well, he dislikes you, you are in hell.
Recent privacy scandals were very embarrassing for many employees. I did not expect my company to intercept wi-fi traffic."

Account manager,5.0,"Nov 3, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years","Food, tools, the deegre of being a Googler, etc","SMB is a joke, the managers don't even know how to use an excel spreadsheet or do a power point. Some of them might not even know the difference from CPA or CPM. Why they are managers? Simple as that, there are two heads that control everything and they promote people who praises them. One is ex photographer assistant who practices nepotism all the time and the other is a socialist. 
And why Google keep them there? 
Because you Dont need good people to do the work asked. Even monkeys could work in SMB Brazil.
Google hiring bar has decreased a lot in the last few years, HR is doing a terrible job lately, skilled people Dont wanna work there. Why? Its not a good place to be anymore, the money is terrible and they try to sell you a glamour thing.  Who lives on Glamour nowadays? Google Brazil and SMB are totally overrated. If you are a kid that wanna show off as the coolest hipster person in a fratty party, that's the place for you. If you aren't, its a trap."
Software engineer,5.0,"Oct 11, 2019","Current employee, more than 1 year","* Perks - free food, endurance, medical care, multi-sport card, local gym, parental leave, multiple yearly offsite ... (list is long)
* Community - There is a interest group for everything, board games, marathon running, ping pong. Organizing such meetings is awarded as community contributions. 
* Smart people - Nothing boosts your development as working with people smarter then you.
* Performance measured by results - No-one will blink an eye if you will leave work early, work from home for a day or two, or just spend whole day in gaming room. Of course when going for promotion or bad planning can lead people to overwork but it my experience it's employee decision
* You can always switch teams - feeling like changing something or burned out? There are pretty loose rules about changing teams. 
* Self-Development - there are lots of internal courses, options for guidance to learn how to get better at your job, or skills you want to develop.
* Focus on individualism and Collaboration - Your given hard open problems that you are directly responsible for. There is a big focus on collaborating with other teams to reach agreement.","* Slow development cycle - When working on problems on such scale, there is lot of time spent on design and no much on coding. 
* Project Management - Every team decides on their own project management method which can lead to mismanagement and chaos. 
*Possible location + project mismatch - There are a lot of interesting projects and available locations, but there is no guarantee that you can find a match on both. There could be a great project but not available in your location. There is no option for remote work (in usual cases)."

Yes the pay sucks, but you have an opportunity to get your foot in the door.  Introduce yourself to Larry and Sergei, make sure they know who you are.  Do your job well, and don't be shy about telling others what you are excited about.  It's a collaboration mecca.  You can learn a lot while you're here, and you can pick a lot of brains that you may never get to rub elbows with again.

Oh and lunch is free, live bands on Fridays, lots of parties, ski trips, etc.  Just sneak in, on or into.  No big deal.","Sneaking into company events.  Explaining that you're not with adwords but you actually have a meaningful project.

Software engineer iii,5.0,"Jan 23, 2023","Current employee, more than 3 years",Great culture Interesting problems to work on Great perks Gold standard software engineering practices,A lot of what you learn at Google is only going to be useful at Google. I've spent 3 years at Google and spent a lot of time learning about internal tools and processes that won't be useful in a job anywhere else.

Technical writer,3.0,"Jan 21, 2016","Former employee, less than 1 year","It’s pretty well documented that Google has a unique culture. It’s not the typical corporate culture. In fact, just by looking at pictures inside many of Google’s premises, you can see that they look more like adult playgrounds, not places to work.

Google provides an amazing work environment, excellent pay and benefits, brilliant people, and some of the biggest internet services in the world. Google has people who’s sole job is to keep employees happy and maintain productivity.","Yet, for all the pros, I was relatively unproductive and dissatisfied. 

One of the positive aspects of being a contractor is you can usually isolate yourself from office politics. But, one of the things I learnt about being a contractor at Google was that office politics takes up a big part of your day. 

From the perspective of a contractor at Google, a lot of contractors seem to spend a lot of their time trying to outdo, sabotage and stab fellow contractors in the back, in the hope of wining the coveted prize of becoming a full time Goggler. This seems to run counter intuitively to the Google culture. It seems you need to do a lot of “ungoogliness"" to get anywhere - sometimes to even complete your work.

The contractors who get ahead at Google these days, at least outside of Core Engineering, are those who are the best politicians. I left when I realised that these were skills that I didn't particularly want to develop, they just detracted me from the real work.

Saying that, I feel proud that I was given the opportunity to work there. Maybe my expectations were too high."

Product manager,3.0,"Jan 27, 2009",Former employee,"The quality of coworkers is outstanding, though declining over time as we hire more and more MBAs with plain and boring backgrounds.

The perks in terms of facilities are still quite amazing.  You can't beat the lunches in Mountain View, the clear weather, and the energy if you're on the main campus (bldg 40-43).  

If you're on a key team, there's also ample opportunity to jet around the world and work at your own pace doing things you love.","Gone are the days of a biologist being hired as a senior product manager (Salar).  Now Google hires MBAs with 2 years at Proctor and Gamble or 3 years at an investment bank as our typical product hire.  People that thrive on bureaucracy and build up the team.  When HR is more than a few dozen people and there are both HR and Facilities vice presidents, you know that the company has gotten way too top heavy."

- Truly a company that tries to be innovative and do good for society 
- Overall compensation that's hard to match unless you're going to Facebook (competitive base + yearly bonus + equity + all the perks of being at Google)","- The department you go to will dictate whether you have a great time or terrible time at Google.  
- Consumer Operations was a really political organization, with folks who wanted to watch out for their own behinds so would throw others under the bus as necessary.  In this department, we had managers who were not fit to lead.  While rest of Google had flexibility to work remotely, this department frowned upon this which is ironic given the senior director lives in Los Angeles and actually commutes back/forth with a fair amount of remote work.
- Be ready for reorgs often and change of responsibilities 
- There are definite jerks in Consumer Operations department, you wouldn't think it given the transparent, open culture of Google but Consumer Operations has its own culture.  Unfortunately, the Consumer Operations culture is not the Google culture."

Administrative business partner,5.0,"Apr 6, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year",Google offers so many benefits beyond the well known ones like daily lunches.,Easy to feel imposter Syndrome or that you are a little fish in a big pond because everyone is so talented and hard working
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year","1. Food and coffee's taken care of and its actually the most exciting part of your day apart from checking out. 2. Massively culturally diverse environment - you get to work with everyone from all over the globe if you're part of a regional team. Everyone's well travelled and you get the best tips for holiday planning 3. If you enjoy doing mindless tasks on top of your job scope which FTEs tend say are ""a huge waste of their time"" - you'll have plenty of that around and you'll be well paid to do that too.","If you're considering to take on a temp role or treated like 3rd class citizens by FTEs, this is what your experience will be like: 1. Some white badges have a serious superioriy complex (usually Google purists who have been here >7 years) and truly e joy to refer to you discriminately as red badges or ""TVCs"". You're beneath them so don't expect to be treated with decent human respect. Some senior employees find every chance to diss you for having lower standards than Googlers and remind you that all the benefits you have are extended to you because of their goodwill. 2. DEI only applies to users and not TVCs. TVCs must be kept hidden away from senior management at all times. This includes removing all credit on work you've done and letting FTEs shine on your behalf. 3. Expect your mental health to take a toll if you don't have fellow temps on your team. You often find yourself excluded from team meetings, team lunches etc - and you'll hear all about the fun things they get to do over lunch. 4. You wonder why they hire you to do intern-kind of work even though you've got 10 years of experience. Googlers with less experience tell you what to do because they always know better. I really don't recommend you to stay here longer than you need to because a lot of such work only applies to companies as massive and unproductive as the big G. 5. Watch your FTE friends coast- have nice work-from-overseas-breaks every 2 months while you slog away to keep the ground running. Yet, you're absolutely the dispensable one. 6. They don't like to use outside tools and everything is built in house by aspiring engineers who are tasked to make transformative impact. 7. Everything takes FOREVER to be done here. Global calls all the shots and they don't understand how things work regionally. You find yourself going round in circles. Things that take 1 week to do outside usually gets done here in 3 months. There are just way too many people. No wonder investors keep calling for layoffs. It's too bloated and I have to agree. 8. Extremely messy and bureaucratic. Kind of hard to imagine for a tech company that marketed its employee culture so well. For anyone looking to join Google: 1. Most important skill you'll need to have to survive here: Google slides and google sheets. Throw away your other project management tools. Everything runs on these 2. And youll need to keep track of thousands of these because there's no centralised system to manage your tasks. 2. Don't join unless at a higher level (>L7). Otherwise your influence is 0 unless you do well at influencing. 3. Great brand name to have for sure, but your hard skills take a hit if you stay long enough. You'll definitely hone soft skills though. 4. Networking here is so important if you want to ever get things done. Very extrovert friendly. 5. Meetings galore! Well.. at least they're kept short."

Management is quite clear in its communication, and decisions are made keeping in mind the business needs.","Managers - Anyone who has worked at Google will agree that the managers are below par. I wouldn't admit is is true in all cases. However, the average manager at Google, just doesn't have the leadership skills required. 

Lack of transparency from mid management - While the top management is quite clear/transparent with it communications/plans, it is totally absent from mid-management. Again, the issue is with managers. Most managers are busy driving their personal agenda, and they often neglect others' growth in the company. Promotion criteria is totally biased towards 'favourable employees' being more favoured.

Career prospects - Google isn't a place for long term career planning. After a point in time you are stuck, and your role leads you no where, and some of the operational-role based teams aren't sure about the direction of the team. Discussing this with your manager is of no help because the manger simply doesn't have the time for such career enhancement talks.

Overall, Google is headed towards being any other big organization with bureaucracy ranging from lunch table to promotions to reviews."

Engineering at Google may be great but let me tell you that's not the case in Sales. Turnover is super high (I saw many people leave) and managers only care about you achieving MINIMUM 150% of your targets plus multiple side projects in order to have acceptable performance. What's the point of setting sales targets if the unwritten rule is that you need to reach minimum of 150% of your targets and if you only reach 120% or less you will be on track to get fired. True story. Corporate rat race. Absolute hell. Join Google for engineering but please stay away from the Sales teams unless you want to work from 6am to 11pm and weekends on a regular every day basis. As my mentor told me ""If you want a 9-6 job, Google is not for you. You will not get anywhere at Google unless you put in 16 hour days"".  So I left."

- Contrary to earlier reviews, work/life balance has actually been fixed and is fine now.
- Likewise, middle management has been fixed and is generally pretty good now.
- You will work with a lot of really, really smart people and you will learn so, so much.
- People in engineering get a lot of freedom to work on their own side-projects, travel, publish, work on opensource, and so on.
- Everyone MEANS well pretty much all the time. It is rare for people to be underhanded or obviously self-serving.","- Most people are super smart, but many of them lack even basic social skills and they WILL drive you up the wall.
- Google is a really good large company, but it is a large company. Creeping bureaucracy and attempts at making everything more corporate are a daily theme and, if left unchecked, will eventually destroy the culture.
- People retention measured in decades has its downsides. Because Google has been so successful, the old-timers see little reason to adopt engineering practices of the 21st century, and Google is slowly but surely slipping further and further behind the industry in tools and programming practices.

- great learning and development opportunities, 1st class training
- on the big scale: diverse culture and and an environment that's thriving on that
- salary, bonuses and all other perks like free food
- events, both professional and fun","- Work is never ending. Literally, you can't finish anything as the pace is so fast by the time you get something done surely there's 3 other things waiting on your to do list. 
- Hence, long hrs and really bad work life balance. Everyone is super competitive at Google so if you don't want to be left behind you need to match the pace and that means constantly going above and beyond.  Management just says you shouldn't be working outside hrs and prioritize but they don't want to go into the reality of it  and go with a head-down approach.... In addition when it comes to recognition  and promotion obviously they build on this type of performance as benchmark so you are screwed if you try to actually have a life.
-  Flexibility is a myth...  some teams are better than other's but most cases you either don't have time to enjoy perks like going to the gym, getting a massage or you are frowned upon if you do. Not to mention work hr flexibility or working from home, big no no's."

Always on the cutting edge of technology.,"Having come over as a junior member on the support team, I was constantly reminded by other teammates that they had worked at Google longer and, therefore, I didn't matter as much.  I was astounded by the superiority complex numerous full-time ""Googlers"" had toward the temps, vendors, and contractors Google also employs.  This attitude also was exhibited toward employees who came to Google via acquisitions.  Google likes to stress the point of working on personal initiatives and projects.  This unknowingly resulted in the duplication of efforts between locations.  If it was discovered that a person in another location was working on a similar project, there was usually a meeting to compare initiatives.  If the projects were similar and your peers had seniority over you, you were forced to stop your work even after having invested months on it.  At other times co-workers actively stole project plans and claimed as their own.  On another occasion, one of my personal projects was ""taken over"" by a manager who thought my project would benefit their current initiative.  I was forced to stop work on my project as it had been transitioned to the manager's team.  That said, many of the people are actually quite wonderful.  Just keep in mind that as Google grows, there are less ways to be noticed and moving up is more difficult which means many people will try to get ahead any way they can."

-You just don't want to leave the company because you are so much in awe of senior leadership and the direction in which the company is headed.","-Middle management in the sales side of things needs a major revamp. Absolutely no regard for career development, work-life balance. Faulty and biased performance appraisal. Extremely non-Googley. The middle management lacks in people development skills and are too busy trying to push themselves up to bother about their reports. No recognition for rewards in the sales teams and as long as you are in the favored circle of the manager, your career is made.

-While senior leadership in MV is extremely supportive of feedback, speak out to your local leaderhsip and you ring the death knell of your career at Google.

-The sales side is turning into a nightmare with the sales HR in turn unable to turn things around or raise critical employee issues and thus resort to delivering lip service to employees. The senior leadership in MV needs to take a serious look into this."

The nepotism is the worst I have ever seen in my career. Certain managers are just openly favoring their friends.
- Sales operations is not a mature  operation. The CRM data is totally incorrect, payouts for deals often go to the wrong rep... literally a 50-50 shot that you will get paid on what you sold. Trying to get contract changes approved is a nightmare.
Facts - 
- 10% of outside field reps on an individual number made their number last year. Many were not even close. 
- In my region there were two reps out of 20 over quota. Those two reps, of course, were handed accounts that would have been buying from anyone. All about which accounts you are handed. 
- The uplifts on quota are absurd. 100%, 150% increases over what that territory did last year. Unless you have a huge, new deal... and given the length of the sales cycle it will be a year or two if you are not handed an account, you will not hit quota. If people were shown how many reps missed quota last year and understood their chances of success coming in, they would have a difficult time recruiting people... and this is an opportunity to work at Google."

Health, dental, yearly bonus, vacation, and pay raises are amazing.","The culture and environment has become a joke. Google was once the most sought after company for employment, but it has lost it's unique charm from over a decade ago. Now it's a corporate monster that has grown far too big. We were once the #1 company on Forbes' 100 best companies to work for and it hurt us deeply when we dropped to #2 after many years at the top. Fast forward to 2020 and we don't even make the top 100.

There is a serious lack of coherence and communication anymore. Motivation to succeed is not based on making great products, but instead on what you can do for promotion. This is clearly evident in the products we develop - or develop then abandon. It's also why we once had nine discrete messaging apps while many other products included messaging functions.

The world would be a better place if great ideas like Google Fiber, Stadia, and Voice were better executed. However, we're left with products that are not only made fun of by the public, but given countdown clocks to when they'll be discontinued. What remains are disjointed products like Gmail - including a UI so butchered and bloated, they needed to add a loading screen so you didn't think long loads times means the service is down. 

We once did great work and were on the top of the tech world. This is no longer the case and I doubt we could ever get there again. We're too large, too slow, too disparate, and have so many competing visions, that there is no return to our former glory days."

You get the chance to work with and learn from some amazing people. Very high code quality, not just at the level of coding style or individual classes, but the overall system architecture, things tend to be really thought through, stupid things don't happen.

The company is very helpful with immigration issues. Good 401k program.","Google's tech stack is big and complex. You will be spending a lot of time figuring out how to plug together various systems and APIs. You may be spending a lot of time looking at various status pages, trying to understand whether your tasks are doing what they should with acceptable performance and why not and which obscure configuration option you need to tweak to make them. A lot of what you will need to learn to do the job will be specific operational knowledge about how to work that unwieldy beast that is Google's infrastructure.

The code complexity is considerable, which means that implementing simple features can take much more time than you'd think it should. It also means it can take a lot of time to get to the point when you feel like you at least somewhat know what you're doing.

The company keeps the copyright to all your hobby projects. They have a system through which you can ask that the copyright be released to you on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes they'll say yes sometimes they'll say no."

2. this is a company with billions of dollars that simply doesn't care to keep all employees insured

4. be more diverse 
5. not much opportunity for advancement unless someone leaves
6. work life balance is a tough achievement if at all, I worked a lot of odd hours

My favourite offering is the amazing 'Tech Stop' facility where if you have IT problems you can drop in and they go out of their way to assist; this most boost productivity no end. Respect for user data, the limitations in place are extraordinary even for what one my consider fairly mundane info.","Often people working at a level below their experience/qualifications, Google-centric way of thinking so easy to lose site of what's going on in the wider industry, package is so good it can be difficult to leave even if you don't feel challenged, a mentally draining and contradictory approach to people performance management, a 'yes man' culture where an over investment of time is spent on multiple projects as opposed to people constructively calling out the flaws or lack of impact early on. A move away from financially supporting external qualifications which isn't necessarily great if and when you want to move on."

The chance to meet some very bright and interesting people.  There are so many opportunities to educate yourself about the world through your employer - everything from tech talks on a variety of technical topics to visits by politicians and public figures.  It's cool to be on the inside and learn about new products everyone else will be talking about soon.","My experience was that of an intern so it may not be typical, but I ended up doing work I had absolutely no interest in and didn't envision getting my degree for without much opportunity to do something different.  When interns are recruited they don't have much of a say on what type of work they'd like to do, so if you're stuck with something you don't like and want to work on more interesting things, that's what evenings and weekends are for.

If you have a PhD you can do some fascinating things at Google, but if you just have an undergrad degree you might be better off at a smaller company where you will get more opportunities to do different kinds of work that span several job positions at Google."
Sales manager cloud,1.0,"Oct 5, 2018","Current employee, more than 5 years",Good salary and perks. Good infrastrutture.,"This review is about the GOOGLE CLOUD division (everything written below applies solely to Cloud. The other divisions are amazing as usual).

Since Google decided to boost Google Cloud Platform in the market, the Company culture is gone:
- extreme work pressure, zero work/life balance, no respect for the employees
- top management impose a top-down approach: results are expected from everyone without first asking in the field what constraints, challenges and needs are there
- managers get attacked on results (assumptions on results are made) and must justify themselves to higher managers who Just joined the Company and do not know the first thing about the context. People are assumed guilty and must defend themselves, instead of being supported in their job.
- huge numbers of former Microsoft, IBM, SAP and most traditional companies are being recruited, bringing along the culture of back-stabbing, zero collaboration and old-style attitudes (many don't even manage to use the Internal company tools, resulting in old-style way of working and a lot of time and nerves loss for the other employees).
There is NO program to onboard the new old-stylers to the Google culture.
- many employees of the former Cloud org have left to other internal divisions or quit Google because they couldn't recognise the Company they used to work for anymore."

- Possibility of taking on a 20% project which does not even need to be connected to core job
- Techy, data driven, nerdy, quirky culture
- Great technology + GCP is getting more and more successful particularly among startups/ tech companies
- Intriguing environment, just check things like ""Talks at Google"" on YouTube
- Great benefits, salary, stock options","- Google Cloud, particularly in the startup/ SMB segment feels a bit like startup itself which also means chaotic at times - Many processes aren't well defined
- Too many complex, self built tools

In many of those reorgs, people weren't being recognized as individuals, but more just cogs that need to be put in place for Google to build the next $10BN business.  Google talks a good talk and employees believe management.  However, over the years employee's expectations have become so high, that when an individual is in a poor job situation, they feel like Google owes them something better.  So you have people who sit in a role/team/dept thinking the situation will get better or that management has a good plan, and they'll be fine once they give it a few months.  In reality, that person is either overqualified for the role or a bad fit, but are too complacent to change.  Many employees can't even fathom leaving Google, so they sit there and hope it works out and will figure it out once the new dream role opens up.  But that doesn't happen and so they wait it out until the next reorg.  The cycle continues."

Senior account manager,3.0,"Mar 13, 2016","Former employee, more than 5 years","Comfortable office, free food, discounted massage, fun quarterly parties, good business trips and offsites abroad if you are lucky. Great as a starter job in your 20s.","Lots  of people in there stuck at L4 and below roles. Core work very boring, repetitive and unchallenging. Expected to create projects for no reason that are often ignored and not implemented unless you go through many internal stakeholders and they all like you! Lots of brown-nosing required to get promoted. Google forces a competitive environment in terms of its bell curve performance review practices which means even if you work extremely hard, if it's regarded as a smidgen less than a colleague you could end up at the bottom of the pile and on a written warning. Having a work laptop is a major con as its implicit you should almost always be working, thinking, breathing Google at all times. Since going to a smaller company I can see how demanding and stressful Google were for many years and how I should have left sooner."
Program manager,4.0,"Jan 9, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","The food, the food, the food. We are incredibly spoiled on the Mountain View Campus. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. This is a benefit that all humans take advantage of. In addition to this, the other benefits are no industry secret, on campus laundry rooms, lots of gyms, cars on demand in case you have to drive during the day, the list goes on.","The promotion process is very arduous. It literally costs Google two months of productivity every year for every people manager. It is insanity. As a manager, its very important to prioritize ""perf"", as you do not want to be the reason your report does not get promoted. This results in two stressful months per year where its very difficult to focus on getting work done.

I will say that Google tends to promote the right people - there are very few false positives, there are many false negatives. Not sure this is worse than manager centric review structures where one person controls your destiny, but there are definitely room for improvements.

Other big complaint: this place is starting to really limit risk. Emerging and experimental projects are increasingly being canceled in favor of revenue generating projects. Google is no longer the place for experimentation, that happens in other parts of alphabet.

Being in the Apps PA, there is a laundry list of B2B features that all apps are being asked to implement. This leaves little room for innovation and creativity, its just about execution. The apps are tools for sales to land cloud and productivity suite contracts."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Apr 24, 2019","Current employee, more than 5 years","The pay, perks, and benefits are awesome. The food is good, and the people you work with are almost all universally at the top of their game. There is no one I work with who doesn't pull their weight or doesn't know what they are talking about (like other jobs I have had).

The offices are really good and it's a fun place to work. I don't know any other job where I can get what I have here.","Google has a reputation for being different, but in a lot of ways it is still a big, hierarchical, company. Work can be stressful and lead to long hours and the amount of work can be hard to manage. The promotion and review system is really opaque. It's sometimes hard to feel like your job is being appreciated.

Work/life balance is not great, and they offer a lot of perks to help with stress and mental health (like massages, 25 counseling sessions a year, discounts to the Headspace app, meditation rooms, etc.) but in practice it seems like lip service. When you have 50+ hours of work per week on your plate, it's pretty hard to cut out early to take a walk around the block or grab a massage. A lot of people are here for a long time, but around the 5-6 year mark a lot of people burn out."

you were at negotiating them.

While most companies will claim that people are their number on priority, Google is the only company I've worked at that actually delivers on this. 

My wife actually almost cried when she learned about the generous paternity leave policy and the ""death benefit"" provided by the company if anything should ever happen to me. It's overwhelming to see an employer go so far above and beyond just to make their employee's families lives better.

I won't say too much about pay other than that my total compensation this year will be 2.5 times what I received at my previous employer ~2 years ago as a Software Engineer.","Sometimes it's difficult for people who are used to being the ""big fish"" at their previous company to get used to the fact that they're aren't the leader of the pack anymore.

Work/life balance at my old job was slightly better, but only because very few people had any passion for what they did so everyone was out the door as soon as they hit 40 hours and never answered email after hours."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"May 15, 2016",Former employee,"Google has a great atmosphere, and they treat their employees wonderfully. Benefits are great for their employees, management is directed to stay out of your business and to avoid micro-managing. This is a rarity amongst employers these days. There's a simple mantra: ""be googley"". Be nice to others. Don't be a jerk. Positivity flows through the work environment, and as long as you work hard you'll be rewarded.","As a contractor, though, there's a very clear line that is drawn between what you get and what the full time Googlers get. You don't get invited to special Google events. You don't get some of the nice benefits and flexibility in scheduling that Googlers get. You're bound to the rules of your contracting agency, whoever that may be. This means that you don't get nice health insurance benefits, no 401k, no holiday or sick time; your job is to fill needed hours in Google's staffing, and as a contractor that's all that's expected of you. You often don't get special recognition for doing your job, and there's no guarantee that you'll end up at a job with Google full time - it's all based on business need. This isn't Google's fault. This is the expectation of a contract role. My advice to anyone taking a contract role with Google is to not let working ""at"" Google go to your head. Understand that you work for a contracting agency and not for Google, and don't expect a future with Google because no promises are made."
Software engineer,2.0,"Nov 6, 2016","Current employee, more than 1 year","Competitive pay, lots of free food and snacks, nap room, in-office perks","I work in Google Cloud in the Seattle office, and culture is divided. On one side, there are smart people taking smart decisions, but on the other side there is what I consider a strong white masculine fraternity culture. Sadly, this type of culture comes by people in the buddy-buddy-group taking on short shiny projects, with poor long term support or design, and many times without understanding of the problem in question. The dedicated smart people will actually try to make these ideas work, but the credit would be taken by someone else, or sometimes with others leaving a big mess, as I have seen several times. In my team, this culture goes two levels of depth in management, making senior management unapproachable, and also reflects on the products themselves. There are many visionary type projects, but with broken functionality, or many incomplete solutions for the same goal,"

-free, tasty meals throughout the day

-lots of fakeness from a lot of employees. Many people pretend to be happy go lucky and caring people to impress their superiors but once they are out of sight they show their true colours
-Googlers will categorically ignore you and spend less time with you if you are a contractor
-Zero job security. I was made redundant before the end of my contract
-I am disappointed with the level of intelligence in many employees. A lot of them are very average but will try to talk down on you for no reason
-Not much diversity especially in leadership roles
-No proper onboarding for contractors. There is chaos when you first start and you are expected to figure it out on your own. This leads to a lot of inefficiency and time loss
-No proper access for contractors for internal tools and resources. We are unable to do our work in a time efficient way, so many obstacles in getting access to internal documentation."

Difficulty sticking to a routine. The order you do things at work is almost never the order you do things at home. It can be tough to mirror your schedule and processes once outside the office.
Missing important calls or pings. Oops, my phone was on do not disturb and I missed a meeting! Or my boss slacked me and asked to prioritize something else and now it’s 4:45pm ...
Calling UberEats anyways. You thought you were saving money, didn’t you? Blam-o! $20 minimum and a $5 fee for the higher rated Thai place. Should’ve remembered to buy bread …
Power naps. This could arguably could be in advantages … unless it accidentally lasts 45 minutes after your delivered double entree Thai lunch.
Boredom. Those office convos? Kinda missing Susan’s cat stories, eh? How long can you go without seeing another living human being?
Working slowly. Sometimes the office has an energy. Sometimes your home does not.
No second monitor. How did I ever work without two giant screens looming above me??? All 74 of my tabs are essential!
Iffy WiFi. At home or in a cafe, when the wifi start to spaz and you switch locations a couple of times but honestly spend more time parking and ordering a 6-shot mint mojito coffee with coconut milk and 16 grains of sugar than doing work."
