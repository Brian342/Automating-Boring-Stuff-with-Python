Program manager,4.0,"Jun 21, 2013","Former employee, more than 8 years","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
Software engineer iii,5.0,"May 10, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Feb 8, 2015",Current employee,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."
Program manager,4.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, intelligent and down to earth people (for the most part), and despite there being a lot disgruntled employees about the continued layoffs and mixed feelings about Sundar, Google still really is an exciting place to work with a lot of potential opportunity given the AI movement.","The truth is you could get laid off at any point... and this is coming from someone who was given the highest performance rating possible in 2024. Even if you're hired in August of this year, by Feb of next year there's a real chance leadership has made some top down decision to slash roles in your org or to prioritize a different location for your org. The environment at Google has been increasingly tense and stressful the last 3 years. Managers and those around you are more and more panicked, so it's only naturally that you'll feel the consequences of this in your day to day (bottom line, it's becoming a more stressful place to work and expectations are increasing each month),"
Software development engineer (sde),4.0,"Jul 28, 2025",Former employee,"Google is also known for offering generous benefits, a flexible work environment, and a focus on personal development and learning. The diversity of projects and the impact their work can have globally is another big draw for those who work there. Would you like to know more about specific aspects of Google's work culture","While many employees enjoy working at Google, some challenges have been reported by others. These can include:
1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.

2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences."
Account manager,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Benefits, Colleagues, Pay, Dog friendly and free food.
Overall its a great environment with plenty of perks, amazing people and opportunities to move and learn.","Everything here depends on your direct manager. You will either get a genuine leader who invests in your growth and success or a someone who pretends but is only there to make themselves look good and will actively make your life hell to push you out.

Holier than thou attitudes of middle managers make it very a very toxic and two-faced environment. If you don't follow blindly you will be pushed out of the company under the facade of ""support"". 

Expectations seem to be different for people in the same role depending on if a manager likes you or not.

Untrustworthy people in influential positions who play the politics game instead of actually serving customers. 

HR dont take reports of bullying and discrimination seriously enough.

They don't actually care about customers and doing things the right way, its a fake customer first mindset while you're forced to shove products down businesses throats even though it could ruin their business.

Overall - be very cautious of the people around you, because behind the smiles, fake ""we're a team and support each other"" talk and ""Googliness"", there are some who want you to fail."

If you need extra peripherals at the hot desk you get assigned, or even working ones? Yeah, about that. It's now just another MS/AWS etc clone."

	•	Predictable: Focuses heavily on algorithms, system design, and coding (LeetCode-style).
	•	Standardized Evaluation: Less dependent on interviewer’s subjective judgment.
	•	Preparation Resources: Many books and online courses match the actual process.","•	Long Process: Can take 6–8 weeks with multiple rounds.
	•	Less Domain Specific: Doesn’t always test real-world trading/quant skills (if applying for quant or finance-related roles).
	•	Bias Toward Algorithm Skills: Great for pure coding, but doesn’t fully assess research or strategy thinking."

Datacenter technician,1.0,"Jun 6, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years",Some pretty cool people work there.,"Horrible management. Low performers get away with doing nothing and still get decent performance ratings while high performers are only rewarded with more work for the same pay and often get low ratings. Managers have no idea what any of their direct reports actually do on a daily basis. They also play favorites and micromanage the people they don’t like. Long history of friends/significant others reporting to and being directly managed by each other - huge conflict of interest there but no one says anything. Promotion process is ambiguous and unclear, requires self-nomination, and there is a set quota for how many people can receive each rating. Used to be a cool, fun place to work but more and more amenities and privileges are taken away every year. Many long-term employees have rage quit mid shift, never to return again. They are laying off and firing hundreds of long-tenured employees while actively interviewing and hiring their replacements and the caliber of people they’ve been hiring lately is…questionable at best. An absolute shitshow. 0 stars, do not recommend. Mental health/well-being and morale are at an all time low and it’s only going to get worse as they continue to go the way of the rest of corporate America."

Bureaucracy & Scale: As a massive global organization, navigating internal processes, getting approvals, or initiating changes can sometimes be slow or feel bureaucratic.
Integration Challenges: Working with global teams across different time zones can sometimes present communication or scheduling challenges.
Role Specificity: Your experience can vary significantly based on your specific team, manager, and project area. Not all teams operate identically."

This was my only experience in big tech so take it with a grain of salt, but I say this from conversations with peers at other big N companies. The atmosphere, flexibility, career prioritization for developers, ability to escape bad managers, is quite good, AND unusual.

Benefits. Probably what you hear about all the time, but worth reiterating. The value of the benefits will impact your total comp. at Google when directly comparing offers, but in my opinion it's a worthwhile tradeoff.","Lay offs. Not specific to Google, and the worst is behind us, true, but they continue, just quieter. The standard is high, and when it comes time for management to make a tough decision, employees are stack ranked. This won't sneak up on you, you can know pretty much how you stack up at any time, if you pay attention to available metrics and your conversations with your managers. But its a risk associated with the high pay, benefits, and career strength of a job at Google."

Everyone is frustrated and discourage about this, but the managers are blaming upper management and basically they do zero pushback
- A particular number of CLs per week is incredible stupid, it's surprising that Google is asking something like this (read about Goodhart's law)
- The management started to treat Bucharest employees like robots who have to execute as much and better as possible

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 28, 2025",Current employee,"The process we've gone through to analyze and manage the Docker images, particularly in addressing the large storage usage in the /var/lib/docker directory, has proven to be highly productive and efficient. By systematically identifying the root causes of the excessive disk usage—such as the accumulation of  tagged images, unused containers, and redundant image layers—we were able to devise a clear and actionable plan to reclaim significant disk space. The step-by-step approach, starting with checking the container references using docker ps -a, followed by removing unused containers with docker container prune, and then targeting the dangling images with commands like","docker image prune -f or the more direct docker images | grep '' | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u | xargs -r docker rmi -f, ensured that we addressed the issue comprehensively. This methodical cleanup not only reduced the storage footprint from 342GiB by approximately 70GiB by removing the  images but also set a foundation for better Docker resource management moving forward. Additionally, the process highlighted the importance of understanding Docker's image and container lifecycle, which can prevent similar issues in the future, making the overall workflow more streamlined and productive for maintaining system efficiency."

Strategy & operations manager,2.0,"Jun 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",The microkitchens were great. Cafés were always good. The pay is top-tier.,"Google used to be a great place to work. There was a clear vision, great products, and a sense of fun in the workplace. Unfortunately, the ex-consulting management class as completely destroyed any semblance of what made this a great place to work. I watched it all happen during my 6 years at the company, from 2019-2025. Here are just a few examples:

Return-to-Office
Rather than embrace this once in a generation opportunity to reimagine work, leadership chose to double-down on meaningless office attendance tracking. Googlers are expected to commute to an office and fight for meeting room space to take video calls with colleagues across the world.

Location strategy:
Googlers in many functions are being pushes to move to lower cost locations (think Texas and Georgia) for the privilege of being paid less.

Career Growth:
Opportunities for promotion have all but evaporated. if you do want a promotion, or even a new role, expect to be asked to move to a lower cost location (see above).

Leadership
Management doesn't care about you or the product. Only about the stock price. They will tell you platitudes about coming together, about listening to feedback on surveys, about needing to do better, and then will continue to make decisions that make life worse and worse for you. Performance ratings are a moving target and everything the company does makes it seem like they're trying to make it easier to fire you or pay you less.

Product
Other than shouting ""AI!"" at every opportunity, there is no creativity left. Our products have been degraded by years of shortsighted, tight-fisted, avaricious decisions. It's a shame. We used to have the best products.

Bureaucracy
Despite all the layoffs (a topic for another day) the company is still as bureaucratic and frustrating as ever. There are teams upon teams that exist to justify their own existence, and getting things done is a struggle.

Overall there's a general sense of cowardice among the leaders of this company. There are no visionaries. Nobody wants to do anything. It's all performative leadership where directors talk about doing big things, and then nothing ever is accomplished because nobody will stick their neck out.

Google is resting on its laurels, and landing a job there isn't what it used to be."

- Cannot rely on managers for project. You need to find your own niche within your team and develop your own projects. This can be hard to do if the team seems busy with impactful projects and you are left alone trying to find work to do.
- The ""non-startup"" culture makes it easy to slack off or not seek growth. You must take care not to fall into this trap, constantly looking for skills to grow.
- Recently, not much emphasis is placed on fun activities or ""team bonding"" exercises. It seems like ""more work and less fun"". This is true at least in Google US."

Resources & perks: The company provides excellent resources for designers, including top-of-the-line software, research teams, and usability labs. Plus, the perks (benefits, work environment, learning opportunities) are world-class.
User-centric approach: Google takes UX seriously, and user research is embedded in the design process. If you're passionate about data-driven design, this is an ideal place to grow.
Impactful projects: The scale at which Google operates means your work can reach millions (or billions) of users worldwide.","Slow decision-making: Despite being a fast-moving tech giant, the sheer size of Google can make getting approvals and launching new features a slow process.
Hierarchy & bureaucracy: While the culture encourages open discussion, senior leadership ultimately has a lot of control over decisions, which can sometimes make innovation feel constrained.
Work-life balance depends on the team: Some teams have a healthy work-life balance, while others expect long hours. It largely depends on your manager and project deadlines.
High expectations & competition: The bar is set high, and performance expectations are demanding. It can be a high-pressure environment, especially for those looking to advance."

Welcome to Google’s Steve Ballmer era.

 Your experience will vary vastly from department to department, team to team and manager to manager. I’ve had amazing experiences pre-Covid, and unusutainable situations post. With internal mobility limited having a bad manager becomes much more problematic than in the past with no real solution. A good number of sales is completely burnt out and certain sectors more difficult to work in than others due to sector customer growth trajectory. Also - being front line sales to staunch a bleeding search business is inherently not fun. Corp just launched a dashboard stack ranking all AE’s against their peers, and they are testing mandatory requirements to turn on AI call listening during customer calls (this will be used in future to assess how strong the salespeople are, and downstream eventually replace the salespeople). The department I was in (large customer sales) is over managed and given far too many metrics to hit. 

Stack ranking will become a clear and present danger in the next few years due to pressure cooker environment and very aggressive goals. My sector in LCS was a rotating firing squad for the manager who didn’t hit their numbers (for reference- this is usually a % of a brands overall revenue that goes to marketing…. And with less revenue in a recession, there are already headwinds before you factor in the decline of search advertising).

No meritocracy + highly political due to stack ranking and layoff fears - showing up for customers takes a back seat to bringing in short term revenue and hitting internal metrics.  1 person does work and 9 different teams take credit.  So you have to be comfortable being that 1 in 10 that does work, or the other 9 that take credit. Pick your poison. 

Certain levels (L6) are not long for this world in GBO, and the highest difficulty level for mobility right now is L5 due to L6s taking demotions to stay at the company, and L4 wanting growth. 

I was on a front line sales specialist team and organizationally it was chaos. In last 4 years had 4 restructures, 3 different roles under 3 different managers. If you happen to be part of a toxic org don’t take it personally if you feel on a constant spin cycle. In my department you would hit a metric in Q4, then 2 months later the calculation updates and you can go from 95% feature attainment to 20% with absolutely no change from your customer. So with a poor manager you could easily be quietly let go due to performance which the numbers would support, because on paper you’re not performing (due to the constant change). This makes your manager now make or  break. 

When I left I needed to schedule and run 3 hours of internal meetings per day in order to do my job and hit my feature adoption numbers as a front line seller. Spent 5% of time speaking with customers because the products were constantly changing and breaking.  Absolute nonsense

Top leadership talent in Ads left or leaving in the last year to go outside the company. 

If a friend had an offer I’d tell them to join unless they had another MAG7 offer, but be incredibly vigilant - check in with themselves once a quarter, and be ready to leave externally at a moments notice should conditions change.","internal mobility very difficult
- turning into IBM
- bureaucracy & largely uninteresting work
- Hours can be bad (50+) depending on team
- Burnout inevitable in new paradigm
- Dispersed teams leading to an isolated work environment
- Lots of overlap and dwindling support
- dog eat dog / “what have you done today” culture
- limited learning / stalled career trajectory outside comp
- High stress hitting unrealistic metrics with limited support and control
- Ineffective middle management
- No longer stable - real and present layoff and silent layoff fears plus stack ranking make it unappealing for top performers"

It's just another corporate company environment (location dependent) at this point, with free meals and neat office decorations. Promotions are committee based. The goal post is constantly moved on what is needed to progress to the point that burnout sets in. If a certain manager isn't particularly fond of you, you are blackballed from any project work. Management doesn't treat people like people, but more like a number. They don't take the time to get to know them and where they come from, or what they want to do."

Software engineer,2.0,"May 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","- The pay is very good. Very high year-on-year raises and bonuses, very lucrative stock shares.
- Depending on your team/product, it's possible to work on very high-visibility projects that look great on a resume.
- Lots of experience ""working at scale"" as per Google's favorite talking point
- It's true that most people you work with are really very smart, motivated, and proactive","- The company is moving in a direction that gives individual employees less and less freedom and judgement to do their jobs. The Google logic is: if we want people to start/stop doing something, we invest money into enforcing it. This applies to everything from minor coding style, to attendance and parking. Infringements of all kinds can result in a pay cut. The attendance policy uses your IP address to detect whether you're working from home or somewhere further away. Meeting rooms track faces, and will send you an email if not in your assigned meeting room 15 minutes into the meeting. Managers have a dashboard to see daily badge-ins.
- Very strong emphasis on hierarchy and individual ownership. Little emphasis on teams. Engineers are incentivized to ""own"" things and supervise others rather than to collaborate and help each other.
- Google is very old-fashioned in the way they do things. They live on not only a ""tech island"" but also a ""process island"". They are very invested in ""waterfall"" development style which favors writing a formal document before making any small code change, and then throwing it over the wall to a junior engineer to implement. Engineers aren't really encouraged to (or given time to) read and learn from sources outside of Google, so most engineers aren't aware of alternatives to or reasoning behind ""the google way"".
- Extremely conservative leveling and promotions. Promotions are highly political and depend heavily on your manager's motivation and presentation skills, which does not always feel very fair. You're typically pushed to operate at ""L+1"" for a year or more before you would be granted a promotion due to arbitrary requirements.
- Little support for junior developers. At lower levels, it can be really difficult to get assigned ""L+1"" projects which will allow you to be promoted. In my experience with multiple teams, it's very common for junior engineers to be isolated from the rest of the team, only getting passdowns from the engineer ""supervising"" their work and little exposure to the rest of the team. People tend to take contributions from lower-level engineers less seriously, solely based on their level, which means more friction to get your job done.
- As much as Google touts their ""fun"" spaces, and their anti-micromanagement philosophy, in practice, you get assigned way too much work to be able to make use of this. There is no time to learn and grow on your own. In all the years that I've worked for Google, I can count the number of conversations I've had with co-workers on two hands (and I'm a pretty social person). It's really not a people-centric company at all anymore."

Software engineer,4.0,"Apr 17, 2025","Former employee, less than 1 year","Cutting-Edge Projects: Working on systems like Google Cloud, Search, or AI frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) is thrilling. I’ve built scalable APIs and tackled distributed systems problems that impact billions of users.  

Brilliant Colleagues: My team includes some of the sharpest engineers I’ve met, with expertise in everything from machine learning to backend infrastructure. Code reviews and tech talks are learning goldmines.  

World-Class Resources: Access to Google’s internal tools, massive code base, and training programs (like ML bootcamps) accelerates skill growth. The ability to experiment with new tech is unmatched.  

Compensation and Perks: Competitive salary, generous RSUs, and benefits like free gourmet meals, shuttles, and wellness stipends make life comfortable in the Bay Area.  

Flexible Work: Hybrid work policies allow a balance of in-office collaboration and remote productivity, with great office spaces in Mountain View.","Bureaucracy Creep: Google’s size means layers of approvals for major changes, slowing down project timelines. Navigating cross-team dependencies can feel like a puzzle.  

Workload Spikes: High-profile launches (e.g., new Cloud features) can lead to intense periods, with some weeks pushing 50 hours. Not every team has this issue, but it happens.  

Promotion Complexity: Advancing to senior levels is tough, requiring visible impact and advocacy. The process feels opaque, and some talented engineers get stuck.  

Tooling Overload: While internal tools are powerful, their complexity and occasional legacy quirks can frustrate new hires or slow onboarding.  

Diluted Impact: On massive projects, individual contributions can feel like a drop in the bucket, especially compared to smaller companies where impact is more direct."

Excellent Internal Tools and Documentation: Google provides its employees with highly advanced internal tools and comprehensive documentation, which can make workflows more efficient and transitions between teams smoother.","Slow Approval Processes: Due to the size and complexity of the organization, approval processes for projects and initiatives can sometimes be slow and involve multiple layers.

Career Progression Challenges: Work done in a previous team might not always be fully considered for promotions after switching teams, potentially leading to slower career advancement for some individuals.
High Competition: Getting a job at Google is highly competitive, and the internal environment can also be competitive among talented individuals.
Potential for Bureaucracy: As a large company, Google can sometimes have bureaucratic processes that might slow things down or feel cumbersome.
Privacy Concerns: Some critics and employees have raised concerns about Google's data handling practices and their potential impact on user privacy.
Return-to-Office Mandates: Recent shifts towards hybrid work models and return-to-office mandates have been met with some resistance from employees who enjoyed the flexibility of fully remote work.
Layoffs and Restructuring: Like other tech companies, Google has experienced layoffs and restructuring, which can create uncertainty and impact employee morale.
""Big Company"" Feel: For some, the sheer size of Google can make it feel less like a start up and more like a large corporation, with potentially less individual impact on the overall direction of the company."

Product manager,3.0,"Apr 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Google is very flexible and respectful of your time and work/life priorities. People choose to lean in or lean back from their work depending on what works best for them. Medical leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, personal leave, and carers leave and all sorts of other benefits mean that this is really a job you can make work around anything else going on in your life.

With the new work on LLMs, Google search is also more exciting to work on again. We were already so optimized before, it was difficult to create anything fun and new. Now with new technology, there are more cool projects that feel innovative.","People do sometimes phone it in, and that can be frustrating if you are trying to accomplish something. That isn't my main concern, however. Within search, the director and above leadership seems incompetent. Comparing notes with colleagues, our guesses are: 1) They don't know how to build anything, 2) They have strange incentives are are playing their own games, 3) They are sociopaths 4) They are focused on their families and collecting 7-figure paychecks on the couch. My guess is #2-4. There are a few gems in leadership, but it's not enough.

Some managers are great, but most managers make you scratch your head. Given how promotions work at Google, becoming a manager as an engineer or as a PM has very little to do with skill, and much more to do with luck, time at the company, and how good your own manager was. There are many people I work with who are amazing, and there are also many Google lifers I do not believe would pass the hiring bar for managers if they started interviewing outside the company."

What an amazing place.,"Be in love with where you begin, and expect no power! People are rewarded to be very fake (very self oriented) as there is very little upwards movement.

Inside sales acount manager,3.0,"Mar 29, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","The food is good, but dinner is served late, feels like a tactic to keep you in the office longer.","If you’re looking for career development outside your immediate role, forget it. The company operates like a closed club, especially for the German market from Dublin, where networking and internal connections matter more than skills or performance. There’s little to no chance of moving beyond your current position unless you’re part of the inner circle.

The work environment is heavily driven by KPIs, with constant pressure to perform and outdo colleagues. Instead of fostering collaboration, the culture encourages internal competition, making long term motivation difficult. The focus on short term numbers and performance metrics creates a stressful atmosphere, with little regard for employee well being or professional growth.

The German market, whether managed from Dublin or Germany itself, is purely a marketing and sales organization. There is no real career development outside of these areas, making it impossible to grow beyond your initial role. Internal mobility is nearly non existent unless you have the right connections, and roles outside of sales and marketing are extremely limited.

At its core, the company operates like a call center, especially for sales roles. The focus is on making many calls and closing as many deals as possible, with little strategic thinking or real customer engagement. Employees are expected to follow rigid scripts, hit aggressive targets, and move on to the next lead. Creativity, problem solving, and long term customer relationships take a back seat to short term revenue generation.

In recent years, the company has increasingly felt the pressure from competitors, which has only made the work environment more stressful. Instead of adapting with innovation or long term strategies, leadership has responded by tightening KPIs and increasing micromanagement. The result is an even more high pressure, unsustainable culture where employees are pushed harder without any real investment in their growth or success.

On the positive side, if you’re okay with a rigid structure and thrive under continuous performance measurement, this might be a place for you. But for those seeking a supportive and forward thinking company with real career opportunities, it’s best to look elsewhere. Leaving feels more like a relief than a loss."

Growth Opportunities: There are clear growth paths, and regular one-on-one meetings with managers help keep career goals on track. I had the chance to lead small projects, which helped me build my leadership skills.","Occasional Tight Deadlines: Project deadlines can sometimes be a bit tight, leading to some long hours. While the company does try to acknowledge the extra effort, a bit more time for quality assurance would be beneficial.
Communication Hiccups Across Departments: Occasionally, there were miscommunications between departments that delayed projects. A more streamlined approach to interdepartmental collaboration would make projects smoother.
Limited Documentation for Legacy Code: Some of the legacy code wasn’t well-documented, which added time to projects. They’re working on improving this, but it can be a challenge for newcomers."

Close to impossible to innovate & build products iteratively.

Performance review frameworks creates a culture in which individuals and teams build fences around what they own, and promotes complex solutions even to trivial problems.

There is a big lack of clear leadership who hides behind promoting decisions by consensus and influence. This leads to endless conversations and painfully slow progress from user research to design to implementation.

They don't see beyond the next quarterly earnings report, and it shows in the decisions they make. For the workers, this means never-ending layoffs, constant reorgs and quotas on promotions, and stack-ranking during annual ratings. For users it means higher ups will make questionable decisions we know are bad for users, but make us more money in the short term.

In Taiwan, this is likely to be very attractive, combined with a comprehensive benefits package that often includes health insurance, retirement plans, and various employee perks.

Innovative and Impactful Work: Google is a global leader in technology, and working there offers the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects that impact millions of users worldwide. This can be very motivating and provide significant career growth.

Positive Work Culture: Google is famous for its employee-centric culture. This often translates to a comfortable and stimulating work environment with a focus on collaboration, creativity, and work-life balance. Google Taiwan likely embodies many of these cultural aspects.

Career Development Opportunities: Google provides ample opportunities for professional development, including training programs, internal mobility, and the chance to work with talented colleagues from diverse backgrounds.

Location and Quality of Life: Taiwan offers a high quality of life with a relatively low cost of living compared to many other tech hubs. It's known for its friendly people, delicious food, vibrant culture, and beautiful scenery. Working at Google in Taiwan allows you to enjoy these benefits.","Potential for Bureaucracy: As a large multinational corporation, Google may have bureaucratic processes that can sometimes slow down decision-making and project execution.

Competition: Google attracts top talent, so there can be a highly competitive environment. This could create pressure to constantly perform at a high level.

Work-Life Balance Challenges: While Google aims for good work-life balance, the demands of working for a global tech giant can sometimes lead to long hours or the need to be available outside of typical work hours.

Salary Differences: While compensation is generally good, salaries in Google Taiwan may be lower compared to those in the United States for similar roles.

Limited Scope: Depending on the specific role and team in Taiwan, there might be fewer opportunities to work on certain cutting-edge projects compared to Google's headquarters."

It's all slideware and moving numbers around to make it look like people are working on impactful projects while very little actually gets done.

I watched a team struggle for the better part of a year to build a simple dashboard so that executives could know where key inventory was located and how much of it was available. They seem to struggle with processes that any non-tech supply chain or retail organization does extremely well.

Folks in Cloud are gaming the hiring committee to bring in nepotism hires that seem incapable of bringing about measurable business impact. They are contributing to the lack of transparency and covering for each other's misconduct.

Org structures are set up to fail. Managers communicate almost exclusively through TPMs to avoid accountability for their decisions, Bad actors create information bottlenecks where all status reports or leadership direction flow up and down only through them. I have observed individuals spread disinformation under the guise of executive direction. These same people misrepresent project information upward in a way that is convenient for their own careers, usually at the expensive of another employee. Constant infighting disrupts the pace of business."

With access to cutting-edge technology and mentorship from industry experts, interns gain invaluable skills and experience. The collaborative culture fosters creativity and diverse perspectives, while competitive compensation and perks enhance the overall experience. Additionally, the chance to network within a globally recognized company not only bolsters resumes but also opens doors for future career opportunities. Overall, a Google internship is a transformative experience that can significantly shape one's professional journey.","While interning at Google offers many benefits, there are also some potential downsides. The highly competitive environment can be overwhelming for some interns, leading to stress and pressure to perform at a high level. Additionally, the sheer size of the company may result in interns feeling like just another number, with limited direct interaction with top executives or decision-makers. Interns might also encounter a steep learning curve, especially if they lack experience with the specific tools or technologies used within their teams. Furthermore, the focus on performance metrics can create a challenging atmosphere where interns feel the need to constantly prove their value. Lastly, the cost of living in areas where Google offices are located, such as Silicon Valley, can be prohibitively high, making it difficult for some interns to manage their finances effectively."

Gone are the days where Google values people first. Now, everyone is just a number and a means to an end in getting anything done. And the ""do more with less"" mantra is highly used. Many folks are taking mental health leave for stress, burnout, and complete dissatisfaction with their jobs. The culture is now dog-eat-dog. Your opinions are not valued. They want you to do what you're told, keep your head done, and stay silent. You aren't valued for your brain here anymore. In fact, expressing an opinion or an opposing view to any senior execs will have you fired. There is no psych safety and everyone clings on to just having a job and a large paycheck.

Software developer,5.0,"Feb 25, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year","One of my favorite perks of working at Google India was sleeping in the office cabs on my way to home after a hectic day at work. Also, the cab service is only offered in India. In US, Google provides a shuttle service but the cab service doesn’t exist in any other country (to the best of my knowledge).
Talking about wallets, the security is pretty great. You can leave your wallet, watch, laptop etc. anywhere in the office and can expect to find it back in the same place the next day or with security. In my 2 years at Google, I never heard of anyone’s stuff getting stolen.
Most roles allow for some overseas travel opportunities. I went on a business trip to Europe. I followed all the guidelines for daily allowances (which is pretty generous) and wasn't asked a single question about it. I had drinks when I wanted to and had all kinds of exotic food on the company's card. Some Companies are cost driven where as Google is Value driven. (The cost of asking for business justification for each & every bill is more expensive than letting the employee do some productive work in that time. See point no. 4 under culture)","Google India offers very limited scope for career growth. You obviously can’t become the CEO/SVP/VP working from India when more than 80% of your workforce is based out of Mountain View. The roles in India are very limited too since only a handful organisations are based out of India.

Sooner than later, anyone, who has some iota of ambition and are not constrained by family, move to Mountain View. (The internal mobility is pretty great by the way minus the tons of competition for good roles. See point no. 1)
Google runs a lot of programs to train its management and provides a lot of support to its employees to keep them stress free and remove all politics from the workplace. However, Google is a system run by people and at the end of the day people are flawed. Some politics does creep into the picture. It might be comparatively less than many other places but it does exist."

Accountant,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Health & Dental Benefits + Equity.,"5.8% of the company made up of African & African Americans.
The promise of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives often falls short, as funding meant to support HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and programs for Black professionals in tech can sometimes serve as a superficial effort, rather than creating real change within companies. Many Black employees struggle to advance into leadership positions, facing a lack of genuine support and mentorship. In contrast, White and Asian employees often receive more direct support, as these groups are more prominently represented in leadership roles.

Google’s ""Stay & Thrive"" program, for instance, aims to assist employees who identify as Black, Hispanic, or Native American when they encounter challenges with their managers. This program helps them find new roles within the company without their current manager’s knowledge. However, while a few Black employees may receive support through such initiatives, it’s a small percentage—around 1%.

Given this reality, it's crucial for Black professionals to cultivate their own businesses and alternative income streams outside of major tech companies like Google. While these companies are often celebrated, the reality can be different for underrepresented groups, and the intellectual capabilities of Black professionals are sometimes met with discomfort or resistance within these spaces."

Software engineer,1.0,"Apr 8, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years",Good to have on your CV.,"It's just too intense. There is constant pressure to deliver ""perfect"" and scaleable solutions. Performance review is overly bureaucratic. Promotions are unfair: it mostly depends on how good your manager is and how well people know you. As a result, everyone constantly wastes time in pointless meetings and talking about their work just to gain visibility, as oppose to actually working. Risk-taking is not rewarded; you should not bother spending time on projects that are not guaranteed to succeed. It is better to land a mediocre incomplete product that will live long enough to get you promoted before getting killed off. The team I was on saw many of the most senior VPs and directors abandoning the project when they saw that it wasn't profitable, which is unfair because those at are bottom of hierarchy do not have access to these profit margins, but they end up paying the cost of the failure. Quantity is highly favoured and quality is silently punished. For example, I interviewed many candidates and spend a lot of time and effort to ensure that my interview reports were well-written and detailed, but I noticed that my colleagues hardly cared about this and wrote short and appallingly written reports. Guess which interviewer was shamed on? Me, because apparently I was ""slower"" than my peers. I want to say that the layoffs made things worse, but I'm starting to thinking that's not true. If anything, what the layoffs did is really just shred light on everything that's wrong with the company."

Line level leaders and individual contributors are not trusted or empowered. You are expected to prove your value regardless of the performance criteria you are demonstrating.

Stack ranking is adhered to in a militant way, even if it means downgrading high performing individuals. 

Strategy and understanding up critical work-streams have strong gaps in leaders competency, this results in undervaluing central dependancies and team members that keep the lights on and deliver value year over year with little recognition.

One of the most striking aspects of Google's culture is its unwavering commitment to fostering creativity and pushing boundaries. From day one, I was encouraged to think outside the box, experiment with new technologies, and challenge the status quo. The emphasis on innovation is palpable in every project and team meeting, creating an environment where groundbreaking ideas flourish.

Moreover, the level of talent and expertise among my colleagues is unparalleled. Working alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry has not only accelerated my professional development but has also inspired me to strive for excellence in everything I do. The collaborative spirit at Google is truly remarkable, with teams coming together seamlessly to tackle complex problems and deliver world-class solutions.

In addition to the stimulating work environment, Google places a strong emphasis on employee well-being and work-life balance.

Data sienctist,5.0,"Nov 18, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Cutting-Edge Technology:
Google provides access to some of the best tools, platforms, and data infrastructure in the industry. Working with massive datasets and state-of-the-art machine learning models has been a highlight of my role. I’ve had the chance to use and even contribute to tools like TensorFlow and BigQuery, which has significantly enhanced my technical skill set.

Impactful Work:
The projects I’ve been involved in have a tangible impact, not just on Google’s products but also on billions of users worldwide. Whether it’s improving search algorithms, optimizing ad performance, or working on user personalization, there’s always a sense of purpose and responsibility tied to the work.

Collaboration and Learning:
The collaborative culture at Google is unparalleled. I’ve worked alongside incredibly smart and motivated colleagues from diverse backgrounds. The open culture encourages brainstorming and sharing ideas, which has been invaluable for learning and professional growth.

Work-Life Balance:
Google supports a healthy work-life balance with flexible hours and remote work options (depending on the team). The on-site perks, like world-class cafeterias, fitness facilities, and tech support, also make it easy to manage day-to-day life.

Career Growth Opportunities:
There are ample opportunities to grow, whether it’s through lateral moves, promotions, or access to internal learning resources. Google encourages upskilling, and they provide support for attending conferences or taking relevant courses.","High Expectations:
While the work is exciting, the expectations are equally high. Deadlines can be tight, and there’s always pressure to deliver innovative solutions. For someone new, the pace might feel overwhelming initially.

Complexity in Decision-Making:
Being part of such a large organization means that processes and approvals can sometimes be slower due to multiple layers of stakeholders.

Competition for Projects:
With so many brilliant minds at Google, standing out can be a challenge. There’s always a need to prove your value and take initiative, especially if you’re aiming for high-visibility projects."

Software engineer,4.0,"Nov 4, 2024",Current employee,"Working as a Software Engineer at Google Bangalore has been an incredibly fulfilling experience. From the moment I joined the company, I was struck by the collaborative and innovative work culture that Google fosters. The emphasis on creativity and problem-solving is evident in every project and meeting, making it an inspiring environment to work in.

Work Environment:
Google's Bangalore office is vibrant and filled with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. The open-office layout encourages collaboration, and the availability of various resources, such as breakout rooms and quiet spaces, enhances productivity. The company also prioritizes employee well-being, offering numerous amenities, including free meals, fitness centers, and wellness programs.

Projects and Technologies:
The projects I’ve been involved in have been challenging and intellectually stimulating. Google encourages engineers to take ownership of their work, allowing for a sense of pride in contributions to impactful products. I’ve had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, including machine learning, cloud computing, and scalable systems design. The freedom to experiment and innovate is a significant aspect of the role.

Learning and Growth Opportunities:
Google places a strong emphasis on professional development. There are numerous training programs, workshops, and access to online courses that help employees enhance their skills. The culture of mentorship is prevalent, with many senior engineers willing to share their knowledge and provide guidance. Regular performance reviews and feedback sessions help in setting clear goals and career paths.

Work-Life Balance:
While the work can be demanding, Google understands the importance of maintaining a work-life balance. The flexible work hours and the option to work remotely when needed have greatly contributed to my overall job satisfaction. The emphasis on mental health and well-being is evident, with resources available to support employees.","High Expectations: Google has very high standards, and the pressure to meet performance metrics can sometimes feel overwhelming. This can lead to stress, particularly for new employees adjusting to the pace and expectations.

Complex Organizational Structure: The size and complexity of Google can make it challenging to navigate. At times, communication between teams can be cumbersome, leading to delays in decision-making and project execution.

Rapid Changes: The fast-paced environment means that projects and priorities can change quickly. While this can be exciting, it can also be frustrating for those who prefer a more stable work environment.

Workload Variability: Depending on the team and project, workloads can vary significantly. Some teams may experience intense periods of work, while others may have less demanding schedules, leading to an inconsistent work-life balance"

Accelerated growth consultant,1.0,"Nov 21, 2024","Former employee, more than 1 year","The office is nice, decent salary, nice benefits such as free good, gym and more. Nice team mates.","Starting a new job should be an exciting chapter, filled with hope, ambition, and the eagerness to grow. That’s exactly how I felt when I began my role as an Accelerated Growth Consultant. But what unfolded over time shattered me in ways I never thought possible.

The excitement I brought to this job was quickly replaced by dread, anxiety, and a constant feeling of inadequacy. My manager silently targeted me, and it became clear over time that he had simply decided one day that I wasn’t someone he wanted on the team. It wasn’t overt bullying, but the kind that slowly eats away at your confidence and sanity. He excluded me from important conversations, sabotaged my work behind closed doors, and painted me as incompetent during graduate reviews with fabricated claims.

I wasn’t alone in this experience. Other teammates were subjected to the same treatment, often deciding to leave the company because they simply couldn’t cope. Some of them confided in me about how this manager made them feel so worthless that they contemplated suicide. It’s horrifying to think how one person could cause so much pain and distress in others.

When I reported these issues to HR, I was met with gaslighting. My concerns were minimized, twisted, or ignored entirely. HR seemed more interested in protecting the company than addressing the harm caused by this manager. Despite multiple complaints from different people, he faced no accountability. Instead, he was rewarded with promotions and opportunities in other departments and even international roles.

The Accelerated Growth Consultant role itself was stressful and chaotic. There was no clear structure or straightforward path to success. It wasn’t like a traditional sales role where you could track your progress and adjust accordingly. Instead, everything depended on whether the clients decided to spend—and if they didn’t, you were the one held accountable. It was a constant cycle of confusion, stress, and fear of missing targets.

By the time I left the company, I felt utterly drained and destroyed. A piece of my soul had been taken. I came in full of energy and positivity, only to be worn down by a system that allowed toxicity to thrive unchecked.

This experience taught me how deeply workplace bullying and poor leadership can impact mental health. No one should ever feel like their job is tearing them apart from the inside, and no one should suffer in silence because their concerns are dismissed. It’s time for companies to take reports of bullying seriously and hold managers accountable for the harm they cause. Anything less is unacceptable."

Software engineer,4.0,"Sep 15, 2023","Current employee, more than 3 years","- Pay is very high, especially if you have strong performance reviews year-on-year - Coworkers are highly intelligent and proactive - Very good and well-supported internal tooling (if sometimes overly complex) - Fairly easy to transfer within the company - Relatively relaxed attitude around work schedules and in-person attendance in the office, depending on the team","- Very hierarchical in both structure and style. Decisions from minor code style choices to team processes to larger policies are usually made by some group at a high level and uniformly applied to all, and enforced. - Constant reorgs mean swapping managers every 6 months or so - Incentivizes competition between engineers, which blunts collaboration - Very established ways of doing things that are in many ways frozen in time because of all the heavyweight internal tooling that would be too expensive to change ""at google scale"", as people love to say. Most teams use waterfall methodology. Long-winded, formal detailed design documents are typically prepared by one person and then handed off to the implementers. - Tends to favor overly complex code and documentation - The monorepo makes developing for/with open source libraries a nightmare - Takes a long time to get comfortable/efficient with the Google engineering ecosystem and its ways of doing things. - Cumbersome promotion process that makes getting promoted quickly after joining very difficult - Teams tend to be very meeting-adverse, which makes it difficult to feel connected with distributed teams - Diversity, Equity & Inclusion efforts are talked up all the time, but in reality, this is probably the least inclusive company I have ever worked for. - Shady ethics around the company's ""mission"" that everyone seems to turn a blind eye to"

Learning and Growth: Google provides ample opportunities for professional development and learning. As an L4, I found myself constantly challenged and learning new things. The company supports attending conferences, taking courses, and even has its own internal platforms for continued learning.

Talented Peers: One of the most enriching aspects of working at Google is the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. The level of talent and expertise among colleagues is exceptional, fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.

Work-Life Balance: Google is known for its employee-friendly policies. The company offers flexible working hours, and there is a genuine respect for personal time and work-life balance. This aspect is especially appreciated in the tech industry, where burnout can be common.","Large Company Bureaucracy: Being a part of such a large company can sometimes mean navigating through layers of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes can be slow, and there can be a significant amount of red tape in getting things done.

Competitive Environment: While working with talented peers is a pro, it can also lead to a highly competitive environment. There can be pressure to constantly perform at your best, which might be overwhelming for some."

Psych safety, DEI, and wellness efforts are often performative. 

Education reimbursement can be a plus *if* your manager approves them in time and *if* the payments team doesn't run you around until the deadline passes to pay you.

For example, the old self-assessment / peer-assessment / leadership-assessment ""Perf"" system was brilliant and was a model that other companies followed. It was turned down and replaced by an atrocious ""expectations / anonymous adhoc feedback / check-in"" system that makes everyone feel like they're on a PIP. 

The highest performers are discouraged from setting ambitious goals, and ""doing the right thing for the company"", and are instead encouraged to define modest goals that strictly match the role profile description of their role. The highest priority is ""meeting the expectations"". It feels like whoever is leading People Operations is actively trying to sabotage morale, burn people out, and cause the highest performers to look for the door."

Software engineer,4.0,"Feb 12, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Google has a rich history of engineering excellence and brilliance. Even many years removed from the height of the company's innovation, some of this is still evident through a strongly ingrained engineering culture where things are mostly done in an engineering first mindset. Engineering excellence is obvious across the organization and the products/infrastructure built at Google are a testament to this.

Work life balance is, for the most part, extremely good and good work life balance is ingrained in the culture. I have never experienced pressure from managers to work more than 40 hours a week, and the vacation + holidays are decent (though maybe not the absolute best).","There is a clear lack of vision from top management as many of Google's recent ""big"" initiatives seem to be reactive to other tech companies (instead of proactive). When compared to top executives at similar large companies, the current management falls quite short.

A complicated performance/promotion process exists at Google in an effort to measure employees fairly across the large company, however this comes at the cost of wasted cycles and the gamification of the system. This, along with the large variation in teams results in non-uniform opportunities for promotion/career advancement."

Today, the company has grown so fast and so large that now the majority of people seem to be typical tech industry employees. That means most of the management has now come from outside the company, so that has killed the culture. Psychological safety is gone, especially after the way the layoffs were handled. I miss Laszlo Bock; he knew how to treat the workforce. I miss Larry, Sergey, and Eric. The general quality of my peers has gone down. Not as people, they're all lovely, but as practitioners. Most of them do what we'd have considered low-quality work 5 years ago. It's shockingly bad, really, by comparison.

Data scientist,5.0,"Sep 4, 2024",Current employee,"Collaborative Culture: Google fosters a collaborative and inclusive work environment. As a data scientist, you would often work in cross-functional teams with engineers, product managers, and other specialists, which can enhance your skills and broaden your knowledge.

Work-Life Balance: Google generally offers a good work-life balance, with flexible working hours, remote work options, and a variety of wellness programs. The company also provides generous vacation and parental leave policies.

Compensation and Benefits: Google is known for offering competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package, including health insurance, retirement plans, and other perks like free meals, on-site gyms, and transportation.

Prestige and Network: Working at Google is prestigious and can be a significant boost to your career. It opens doors to a vast professional network and opportunities both within and outside the company.","High Expectations and Pressure: Google has high standards, and the pressure to perform can be intense. The fast-paced environment may require you to continually push your limits, which can be stressful over time.

Large Organization Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Google has multiple layers of management and processes. This can sometimes lead to bureaucracy, slow decision-making, and limited autonomy in certain roles.

Competition for Advancement: Given the high caliber of talent at Google, competition for promotions and high-impact projects can be fierce. This can make career progression challenging, especially in more crowded or mature areas.

Scope of Role: At a company as large as Google, your role might be very specialized, which can limit your exposure to the full spectrum of data science tasks. This could be a drawback if you prefer more generalist roles or want to work on end-to-end projects."
Cloud engineer,2.0,"Apr 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",All Google benefits are amazing! 2 stars given by me are just for this.,"1. For new sub-organizations (within Google) that work on Google Cloud work environment is not great. Please do not get into these orgs!
2. Scope for promotions is very less due to high competition
3. I was shocked to learn that performance review for every individual in this organization is relative. Completing your yearly OKRs and performing excellent on your engagement gives you below average rating at best. You also need to participate in extra curicular activities to ""improve"" your visibility even though its an optional OKR. In every other modern tech company performance reviews are compared against a candidate's own previous reviews. But not here LOL.
4. Most of the Managers leading these organizations have polluted Google's work culture by bringing their own. Despite undergoing training for the same.
5. Moral: If you are getting into Google and your do not work in Google Cloud domain, you will be very happy. Do not work in Google Cloud Orgs. You will get frustrated in 1-2 years."

High Expectations: The performance bar is set high, which can be stressful for some.

• Lots of internal resources to grow one's career, leadership, and skill set","Google used to have an amazing company culture and flat structural leadership. It's what made Google unique and stand out from the rest. Google has since lost it's overall 'unique company culture' by squeezing out innovation unless its perfecting AI to beat out its competitors. Company moral has tanked, employee input no longer feels authentically heard, valued, and actionable, budget constraints have caused a slim chance in promotion - even when consistently demonstrating next level performance. It's also become difficult to transfer btwn different teams to grow one's Google career. Headcount and resources have been restricted, resulting in stiff competition when applying to new roles.
Google has become another heavy, top-down corporate enterprise using tall organizational structure for more leadership control.
I have truly enjoyed working at Google for many years. These past 2-3 years have really flipped in the opposite way. My hope is that Sundar and leadership revert to putting Googlers and users first, rather than stock and revenue."

Perks and Benefits: Google offers a wide range of perks such as free meals, fitness centers, laundry services, and more. Additionally, their employee benefits package is often considered one of the best, including health care, retirement plans, and generous parental leave policies.

Learning and Development Opportunities: Employees at Google have access to various learning resources and professional development programs.

Competitive Environment: While being surrounded by highly talented individuals can be inspiring, it can also create a highly competitive atmosphere. This can sometimes lead to stress and pressure to perform at very high levels constantly.

Large Company Bureaucracy: As a large corporation, Google has its share of bureaucracy. This can mean slower decision-making processes, less autonomy in certain roles, and the potential for getting lost in the corporate structure, making it harder for some individuals to make a significant impact."

Software engineer,5.0,"Jul 19, 2018","Former employee, more than 3 years","Google is a world of its own. At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world.

There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away.

At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways.

Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all  employees.

A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world.

I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in.

Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics.

Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution.

The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own.

Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.)

To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at.

An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than  working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.)

For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting.

Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing.","If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.

Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.

Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war.""

A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.

There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.

Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.

There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro.

Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.

If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.

You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning."

Administrative business partner,5.0,"Apr 18, 2024","Former employee, more than 5 years","Pros for Google as a company:
- PERKS! Absolutely incredible perks. Just to name a few, free meals and snacks, $2000 technology reimbursement when covid hit, commuter cards for metropolitan cities, medical plan with $1000 added by google each year so your deductible is really only $200 annually and then the rest you only need to pay 10% of medical bills, and finally working from home flexibility (I was fully remote since 2020)

Pros as an Administrative Business Partner:
- working directly with and having an extremely close relationship with VPs, Directors, and Senior Managers at the company
- being able to be the go-to-person for hundreds of engineers (the folks that make up your assigned Directors teams)
- Traveling to different countries or offices for your directors summits
- Independent job that doesn't rely on anyone else, for the most part
- The pay: I made $130k annually (after 4 years of being an admin). To me, this is far above the industry standard","Cons for Google as a company:
- as most people have seen in the last few years, even at Google you're just a number. In 3 rounds of layoffs, folks weren't given any notice, they just woke up one morning to find that their access had been shut off. I don't blame google for doing this when they needed to layoff thousands of people, but just keep in mind that even at Google (in my opinion one of the best places to work) you're still just a number.

Cons about being an Administrative Business Partner:

- ""Girls Club"" energy: this is a female dominated role, thus there are a few cons specifically related to this. unfortunately the Admin teams i've worked with have always been chatty, gossipy, and not very tech savvy. These are what they call ""career admins."" Ex: women who started being an EA in the 80s or 90s before technology, and stayed in the role until their 40s and 50s. Not very good at their jobs, but unaware. 

- Ageist: being under 30 in this role means you'll never hear the end of the ""career admins"" unwarranted advice, or talking down towards you, despite the under 30 admins almost always being far better at their jobs than the admins over 40

- Promotions: getting promoted is specifically about who you know. the promotion committee is made up of senior admins, thus if you're not best friends with the admins on the committee, it will be much harder for you to get promoted. 

- despite this being an independent job that doesn't rely on the other Admins in your org, you're forced to attend unnecessary meetings with your fellow admins, which often times are full of gossip and ""back in the day"" chat."

Recruiter,3.0,"Feb 3, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year","- Having a good experience at Google depends largely on your team and I had a great team that I was sad to leave. - Good severance when laid off - Amazing benefits while employed, would have made it difficult to leave the company by choice despite being unhappy with a lot of aspects of the work","Role-specific: - Very bureaucratic + lots of red tape when it comes to hiring. As a result, hiring process takes minimum 3 months (usually closer to 4/5 months) for a req to close and the recruiter really can't control this timing much. This makes it hard to keep candidates happy and difficult to meet quarterly goals since making each hire often takes longer than a quarter. - Some hiring managers can be tough to work or exhibit an elitist attitude; hard to convince some to follow inclusive hiring steps since they will have such a clear idea of the ""type"" of candidate they want. In general: - You really are just a number while working at Google. It's possible to build strong relationships and not feel this during the day to day, but leadership makes it clear. Examples: Lay off method was cold and not based on employee impact or performance. Leadership will remove benefits without warning, such as being able to work remotely. - Upward and internal mobility is extremely difficult. Promos take years and applying for internal roles is very competitive, so make sure you're prepared to stay in the role you're hired into for 3-4 years before even being looked at for mobility."

It's been over a year of not even be able to get a monitor or a laptop. You know it's bad when they stop hardware refreshes and force everyone to use a Chromebook because they choose not to afford a $2000 Windows or Mac machine while paying their people allegedly the top ""10%"" of the industry.

Half of the time we are struggling about which one is the ""source of truth"" and chasing after our own tails and the other half of the time spent in meetings (no agenda, just people talking as if they know everything), and the actual work (if you do want to do so) eats into your life. Middle management has no clue about what the real work is, and pays no interests in understanding it. Just busy working upwards themselves and change strategy without any base, or consistency from before. HQ pays no/little attention outside of California, the rest of the world doesn't exist for them.

Software development engineer (sde),5.0,"Feb 17, 2024",Former employee,"Search Engine: Google's search engine is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, in the world. It provides users with fast, relevant, and accurate search results, helping people find information quickly and efficiently.

Gmail: Gmail is a popular email service offered by Google. It provides users with ample storage space, powerful search capabilities, and integration with other Google services, making it a preferred choice for many individuals and businesses.

Google Maps: Google Maps is a comprehensive mapping service that offers detailed maps, satellite imagery, real-time traffic information, and turn-by-turn navigation. It helps users navigate unfamiliar places, find local businesses, and plan routes efficiently.

YouTube: As the world's largest video-sharing platform, YouTube allows users to upload, share, and view a wide variety of videos. It has become an essential source of entertainment, education, and information for millions of people around the world.

Google Drive: Google Drive is a cloud storage and file synchronization service that allows users to store, access, and share files and documents from any device with an internet connection. It offers generous storage space and seamless integration with other Google services.

Android: Google's mobile operating system, Android, powers the majority of smartphones and tablets worldwide. It offers a customizable and user-friendly experience, a vast ecosystem of apps, and regular updates and security patches.

Innovation: Google is known for its commitment to innovation and pushing the boundaries of technology. From self-driving cars to artificial intelligence research, Google has invested in a wide range of projects and initiatives that have the potential to positively impact society.

Free Services: Many of Google's services, such as Search, Gmail, Maps, and Drive, are offered to users for free. This accessibility has democratized access to information and communication tools, benefiting people around the world, especially those in underserved communities.

Developer Tools: Google provides developers with a wide range of tools and platforms, such as Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, and TensorFlow, to build and deploy applications, websites, and machine learning models.

Corporate Culture: Google is known for its unique corporate culture, which emphasizes innovation, employee empowerment, and a fun working environment. It offers numerous perks and benefits to its employees, fostering creativity and collaboration.","While Google offers numerous benefits and services, there are also some criticisms and concerns associated with the company. Here are some potential cons of Google:

Privacy concerns: Google collects vast amounts of user data through its various services, including search, Gmail, YouTube, and more. This data collection raises privacy concerns, as users may feel uncomfortable with the amount of personal information being collected and analyzed by the company.

Data security risks: With so much personal data stored by Google, there is always the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. While Google invests heavily in security measures, no system is completely immune to attacks.

Monopoly power: Google's dominance in various markets, such as search engines, online advertising, and mobile operating systems, has raised concerns about its monopoly power. Critics argue that this dominance stifles competition and innovation, potentially harming consumers and smaller competitors.

Algorithm bias: Google's search and recommendation algorithms have faced criticism for potentially promoting biased or misleading information or favoring certain websites or viewpoints over others. This can have implications for public discourse and democracy.

Lack of transparency: Google's algorithms and decision-making processes are often opaque, leading to concerns about accountability and transparency. Users may not fully understand how their data is being used or how search results are generated.

Tax avoidance: Like many multinational corporations, Google has been criticized for its tax practices, including using various legal loopholes and offshore tax havens to minimize its tax obligations in certain jurisdictions.

Environmental impact: Google's data centers and other operations consume significant amounts of energy, contributing to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. While Google has taken steps to improve its environmental sustainability, concerns remain about its overall impact on the planet.

In addition, the overall work environment is positive, as colleagues are generally friendly, supportive, motivated, and intelligent.","The job itself can be a strange one. A lot of time is spent creating work for yourself, as opposed to actually doing the work necessary to grow clients. Google, especially GBO, is very overstaffed, which leads to a lot of weird gamesmanship to try to get promoted. This includes making up weird groups, pointless sales initiatives, taking credit for things that just happen as opposed to being the result of actual effort on the part of the sales staff. As a result, people are rewarded not necessarily for their ability to sell, but for how well they can play the corporate game at Google.

Work-Life Balance: Achieving a healthy work-life balance can be challenging due to the nature of the industry and the company's commitment to excellence. It's crucial for employees to proactively manage their time and set boundaries to avoid burnout.

Some of the teams I was in were plain awesome, and I made great friends for life. The offices are good, the pay is good, the perks are good..

It can feel huge and disorganized, and I often felt like my role was not needed and/or I had to justify to management or leadership why my role or team existed in the first place. Process can range from non-existent to ridiculously complex. As they say, Google is the place where hard things are possible and simple things (like getting your new hire their badge) can seem impossible sometimes..

Analytical lead,3.0,"Jan 7, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","The benefits, including externally discounts just for working here, and the pay. They also let people give honest feedback, but it's very rare that they care about it, hold anyone accountable, or change. The company responds better to outside criticism and competition.","The arrogance, but it is really team specific, but horrible in the new DMA (data, management, analytics) org which supports sales advertising. The company is not full of geniuses, which is the propaganda. Some people do get through because they are allowed to fail up, just like with any other company, hired to not be a threat to their manager, or just because they can convince some people that the nonsense they share makes sense if they say it fast and with confidence. This arrogance is not coming from top university graduates, which is the assumption, but those whose talents are limited to working at Google, so they love to brag about their tenure without even reading the room to see if there is anyone listening who cares or would just rather focus on working.

The company has recently done more internal surveys on sentiment and many results fell in the 70 percentage range and senior leaders spun this as positive because it's technically the majority -- sure it's limited by the response rate, but many people eerily believe that the company is a utopia, so I would think the people who would give higher ratings would make sure to respond as well.

DMA lies about the analytical lead role, so if you are a data scientist or work in analytics, you don't want to do this role if that's what you think you'll do more of. You spend more time managing internal egos and explaining to people internally that you have different jobs (the job titles are different, but many people still don't understand). And there is much less movement across teams now as they are still trying to make the company lean and manage/bully people out.

The company gives major cult vibes, which makes sense since it was founded in a top cult producing state. (I know it's not ""really"" a cult.)"

However, after more recent events, it became next to impossible. A lot of teams are not open to working remotely or even working from a different office on permanent basis.

Since flows are not stable, you are expected to debug issues which have zero impact. 
Management expects deadline to be met even with frequent last minute changes.
Even if you achieve target and expectations, growth and increment are negligible, better to stay in proper hardware company where learning and growth are consistent.
Benefits are not consistent across company. It's a gimmick, no flexibility neither for remote nor relocation.

Try and fail fast mentality leads to many issues as the company's scale can no longer support such an attitude - Entreprenuerial to an extent that there is very little support as you are new to the firm. This organization is a monster of its own to navigate - unlike any in the industry. Without the nature of guidance that initial googlers could access because of smaller scale, many nooglers struggle - Touts as being OKR driven but at a closer look you can see that there is intense data manipulation and storyline projection to show that they met OKRs. OKRs are often shifted - sometimes at the end of the review cycle - contrary to public image, they prefer only aggressive type As and it is sometimes upsetting to see the level of politics that exists - There is no diversity w.r.t personality types. If you are in with the cool crowd - you are in. Else you will struggle."

Accelerated growth consultant,1.0,"Feb 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Beautiful office, great food and snacks, equity, healthcare, gym, pool, often flexible, good products","Our supervisor consistently engages in bullying behavior toward me and my colleagues on a daily basis. These instances primarily occur in private settings, away from the observation of others. The effects of this behavior have been detrimental to several team members, with some opting to take extended leaves due to the resulting exhaustion and negative impact on their mental well-being and job performance.
The supervisor's actions convey a disregard for the feelings of others, often dismissing legitimate concerns and even insinuating that individuals are irrational or unstable. Additionally, he exhibits favoritism, unfairly criticizing certain individuals for minor issues while deliberately overlooking similar behavior in others. His conduct extends to performance evaluations, where he unjustly assigns poor ratings and misrepresents the feedback of team members.
The supervisor targets individuals he holds personal grudges against, burdening them with unmanageable workloads and creating situations designed for failure, only to shift blame onto the affected individuals. His relationship with the Director appears to be built on favoritism and ingratiating behavior rather than merit.
Proving these actions is challenging due to their clandestine nature and the supervisor's adeptness at manipulating information. Numerous employees have either resigned or attempted to leave the team due to his behavior.
Potential new recruits should exercise caution, as they may either become favored by the supervisor or endure daily suffering in silence. For HR personnel, intervention is imperative to prevent further attrition. To those experiencing similar mistreatment, I encourage you to bravely report such behavior to HR. Google removes bad reviews like this one to protect themselves on the outside but in the inside its unfortunately like this.
Its hard to get promoted or move in the org as you would have to be close friends with the managers or the right people."
