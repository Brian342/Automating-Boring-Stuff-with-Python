Job Title,Job Ratings,Pros,Cons
Senior program manager,3.0,"Jul 20, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","Current employee, more than 8 years","Strong legacy and brand – Still carries a powerful global reputation that can boost your resume.
Smart, talented coworkers – Historically attracted some of the best minds in the industry.
Great compensation and benefits – Pay, stock options, and perks (like food and healthcare) are still competitive.","Loss of innovation culture – The once nimble and visionary culture has given way to risk aversion and red tape.
Management bloat and politics – Leadership changes, reorgs, and layers of bureaucracy have slowed execution.
Low morale and instability – Frequent layoffs, reorgs, and unclear direction have affected employee trust and motivation.
Career growth is uneven – Promotions can feel political or opaque; fewer meaningful opportunities to grow.
Declining work-life balance – Depending on the team, pressure and expectations have increased without added support."
Engineer,5.0,"Jul 31, 2025",Current employee,Current employee,"Advantages
High - salary and good benefits: Google offers generous compensation, enabling employees to earn substantial income. Additionally, the company provides outstanding welfare facilities, such as on - site swimming pools, world - class gyms, various sports classes, weekly massages, delicious and healthy meals, and on - site medical care, which contribute to employees' high - quality lifestyle.
Strong technical strength and learning opportunities: As a world - leading technology company, Google possesses cutting - edge technologies. Employees have the chance to access and learn these advanced technologies, enhancing their technical skills and professional competence. They can also gain valuable experience in dealing with complex engineering problems and world - class crisis management and debugging.
Good work - life balance: Google emphasizes a healthy work - life balance, allowing employees to maintain a relatively reasonable working hours and workload, which is conducive to their physical and mental health and the balance between work and life.
Positive corporate culture and excellent colleagues: The company has a positive corporate culture that encourages creativity and innovation. Employees can collaborate with talented professionals from diverse backgrounds, which not only promotes teamwork but also broadens their horizons.
Abundant career development opportunities: Google is committed to the personal and professional development of employees, providing various training programs and workshops. Employees have the opportunity to be promoted and can also explore different job roles and projects within the company, which is helpful for their career growth.","Disadvantages
High - pressure work and high cognitive load: Some positions at Google, such as site reliability engineering, may involve long - term on - call work, which can cause stress to employees and disrupt their sleep. Moreover, Google's technical systems are extremely complex, and employees need to remember numerous systems and technologies, facing a high cognitive load.
Unclear career progression: Career progression at Google can be challenging and depends a lot on the specific projects an employee is involved in. Some employees may find themselves stuck at a certain level, such as level 5, with limited opportunities for further promotion.
Serious internal politics: As the company grows, internal politics may become more prominent. In some aspects, such as performance management and recruitment, managers may need to engage in a lot of negotiation and manipulation, which can affect employees' work enthusiasm and morale.
Cultural differences and marginalization of non - US employees: Google has a strong US - centered culture. Employees who do not work in the US and do not have much influence in their locations may feel isolated or marginalized, and may also be troubled by late - night meetings due to time zone differences.
High - intensity competition: Google hires a large number of outstanding talents, resulting in fierce competition among employees. Everyone is highly qualified, and employees need to work hard to stand out, which may bring a lot of pressure."
Administrative,2.0,"Jun 19, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Current employee, more than 3 years","The pay is highly competitive, and the perks are hard to beat—definitely one of the few places where the benefits package still feels generous. You’ll work with some incredibly smart, talented, and down-to-earth people who make the day-to-day bearable. Some tools and internal systems are well-developed and efficient, which helps get things done faster (when politics aren’t in the way).","Extremely bureaucratic and heavily political environment where who you know often matters more than what you do. There’s a constant cloud of looming layoffs, creating anxiety and instability across teams. Leadership is uninspiring at best, incompetent at worst—nepotism runs rampant, and accountability is nonexistent for people who play the “nice” card, regardless of performance.

The “golden handcuffs” are real. What once felt exciting and promising now just feels like a high-paying trap. The culture has taken a sharp nosedive, and morale is visibly deteriorating."

Administrative,3.0,"May 28, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years","Former employee, more than 5 years",They offer a good wage package and the opportunity to do really amazing work if you have a decent team and leader. The campuses are beautiful.,"Promotion is all political and nearly impossible; it also eats up any managers  time FAR more than it needs to. Remote workers do not get any benefits like onsite workers do (ie free food, gym access, massage time, etc) - not even a gym stipend. Additionally management cannot make up their mind what is important when and change priorities constantly, which then spurs a big argument over either whose fault it is or who REALLY got the work done, but only by the executives, not the team. The culture you think you will find is no longer present, and it's quite heartbreaking. If you enjoy having an assigned desk, good luck. If you need extra peripherals at the hot desk you get assigned, or even working ones? Yeah, about that. It's now just another MS/AWS etc clone."

Product manager,5.0,"May 23, 2025",Current employee,Current employee,"High Impact & Scale

You work on products that impact billions of users, which is rare and immensely rewarding.

Strong PM Community

Google's PM org is mature, well-structured, and full of top-tier talent—great for learning and mentorship.

Resources & Support

Access to top engineers, researchers, designers, and tools. Google invests heavily in product development.

Career Growth Opportunities

Clear career ladder with opportunities to move across teams or grow into senior leadership roles.

Data-Driven Culture

Heavy emphasis on A/B testing, user research, and analytics—great if you're analytical and metrics-driven.

Prestige and Resume Value

Being a PM at Google is a strong signal to future employers and helps open doors across the industry.

Compensation & Benefits

Highly competitive salaries, equity, generous benefits, healthcare, and parental leave.

Innovation Culture

Opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI/ML, infrastructure, and new products like Google Cloud, Android, Search, etc.","Complex Decision-Making

Large orgs mean decisions often require alignment across multiple stakeholders and can be slow.

Scope Limitations

PMs may find their scope narrow or very specific, especially in large, mature products.

Engineering-Led Culture

Google has a strong engineering culture, which can sometimes reduce PM influence in product decisions.

Bureaucracy

Can feel corporate and process-heavy, especially compared to startups or smaller companies.

High Expectations

The bar for performance is very high, and there’s pressure to constantly prove your impact.

Internal Competition

Promotions and top projects can be competitive. Visibility matters, and self-promotion is sometimes necessary.

Less Autonomy (in some roles)

In well-established teams, PMs may not have the autonomy to define the full product vision or roadmap.

Geographical Constraints

Some of the most exciting projects are tied to specific locations like Mountain View, which can limit flexibility."

Datacenter technician,1.0,"Jun 6, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","Former employee, more than 10 years",Some pretty cool people work there.,"Horrible management. Low performers get away with doing nothing and still get decent performance ratings while high performers are only rewarded with more work for the same pay and often get low ratings. Managers have no idea what any of their direct reports actually do on a daily basis. They also play favorites and micromanage the people they don’t like. Long history of friends/significant others reporting to and being directly managed by each other - huge conflict of interest there but no one says anything. Promotion process is ambiguous and unclear, requires self-nomination, and there is a set quota for how many people can receive each rating. Used to be a cool, fun place to work but more and more amenities and privileges are taken away every year. Many long-term employees have rage quit mid shift, never to return again. They are laying off and firing hundreds of long-tenured employees while actively interviewing and hiring their replacements and the caliber of people they’ve been hiring lately is…questionable at best. An absolute shitshow. 0 stars, do not recommend.
