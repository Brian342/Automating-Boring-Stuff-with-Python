Program manager,4.0,"Jun 21, 2013","Former employee, more than 8 years","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
Software engineer iii,5.0,"May 10, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Feb 8, 2015",Current employee,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."
Program manager,4.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, intelligent and down to earth people (for the most part), and despite there being a lot disgruntled employees about the continued layoffs and mixed feelings about Sundar, Google still really is an exciting place to work with a lot of potential opportunity given the AI movement.","The truth is you could get laid off at any point... and this is coming from someone who was given the highest performance rating possible in 2024. Even if you're hired in August of this year, by Feb of next year there's a real chance leadership has made some top down decision to slash roles in your org or to prioritize a different location for your org. The environment at Google has been increasingly tense and stressful the last 3 years. Managers and those around you are more and more panicked, so it's only naturally that you'll feel the consequences of this in your day to day (bottom line, it's becoming a more stressful place to work and expectations are increasing each month),"
Software development engineer (sde),4.0,"Jul 28, 2025",Former employee,"Google is also known for offering generous benefits, a flexible work environment, and a focus on personal development and learning. The diversity of projects and the impact their work can have globally is another big draw for those who work there. Would you like to know more about specific aspects of Google's work culture","While many employees enjoy working at Google, some challenges have been reported by others. These can include:
1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.

2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences."
Account manager,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Benefits, Colleagues, Pay, Dog friendly and free food.
Overall its a great environment with plenty of perks, amazing people and opportunities to move and learn.","Everything here depends on your direct manager. You will either get a genuine leader who invests in your growth and success or a someone who pretends but is only there to make themselves look good and will actively make your life hell to push you out.

Holier than thou attitudes of middle managers make it very a very toxic and two-faced environment. If you don't follow blindly you will be pushed out of the company under the facade of ""support"". 

Expectations seem to be different for people in the same role depending on if a manager likes you or not.

Untrustworthy people in influential positions who play the politics game instead of actually serving customers. 

HR dont take reports of bullying and discrimination seriously enough.

They don't actually care about customers and doing things the right way, its a fake customer first mindset while you're forced to shove products down businesses throats even though it could ruin their business.

Overall - be very cautious of the people around you, because behind the smiles, fake ""we're a team and support each other"" talk and ""Googliness"", there are some who want you to fail."

High Expectations

The bar for performance is very high, and there’s pressure to constantly prove your impact.

Internal Competition

Promotions and top projects can be competitive. Visibility matters, and self-promotion is sometimes necessary.

Less Autonomy (in some roles)

In well-established teams, PMs may not have the autonomy to define the full product vision or roadmap.

Geographical Constraints

Some of the most exciting projects are tied to specific locations like Mountain View, which can limit flexibility."

Engineer,5.0,"Jul 31, 2025",Current employee,"Advantages
High - salary and good benefits: Google offers generous compensation, enabling employees to earn substantial income. Additionally, the company provides outstanding welfare facilities, such as on - site swimming pools, world - class gyms, various sports classes, weekly massages, delicious and healthy meals, and on - site medical care, which contribute to employees' high - quality lifestyle.
Strong technical strength and learning opportunities: As a world - leading technology company, Google possesses cutting - edge technologies. Employees have the chance to access and learn these advanced technologies, enhancing their technical skills and professional competence. They can also gain valuable experience in dealing with complex engineering problems and world - class crisis management and debugging.
Good work - life balance: Google emphasizes a healthy work - life balance, allowing employees to maintain a relatively reasonable working hours and workload, which is conducive to their physical and mental health and the balance between work and life.
Positive corporate culture and excellent colleagues: The company has a positive corporate culture that encourages creativity and innovation. Employees can collaborate with talented professionals from diverse backgrounds, which not only promotes teamwork but also broadens their horizons.
Abundant career development opportunities: Google is committed to the personal and professional development of employees, providing various training programs and workshops. Employees have the opportunity to be promoted and can also explore different job roles and projects within the company, which is helpful for their career growth.","Disadvantages
High - pressure work and high cognitive load: Some positions at Google, such as site reliability engineering, may involve long - term on - call work, which can cause stress to employees and disrupt their sleep. Moreover, Google's technical systems are extremely complex, and employees need to remember numerous systems and technologies, facing a high cognitive load.
Unclear career progression: Career progression at Google can be challenging and depends a lot on the specific projects an employee is involved in. Some employees may find themselves stuck at a certain level, such as level 5, with limited opportunities for further promotion.
Serious internal politics: As the company grows, internal politics may become more prominent. In some aspects, such as performance management and recruitment, managers may need to engage in a lot of negotiation and manipulation, which can affect employees' work enthusiasm and morale.
Cultural differences and marginalization of non - US employees: Google has a strong US - centered culture. Employees who do not work in the US and do not have much influence in their locations may feel isolated or marginalized, and may also be troubled by late - night meetings due to time zone differences.
High - intensity competition: Google hires a large number of outstanding talents, resulting in fierce competition among employees. Everyone is highly qualified, and employees need to work hard to stand out, which may bring a lot of pressure."
Administrative,3.0,"May 28, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years",They offer a good wage package and the opportunity to do really amazing work if you have a decent team and leader. The campuses are beautiful.,"Promotion is all political and nearly impossible; it also eats up any managers  time FAR more than it needs to. Remote workers do not get any benefits like onsite workers do (ie free food, gym access, massage time, etc) - not even a gym stipend. Additionally management cannot make up their mind what is important when and change priorities constantly, which then spurs a big argument over either whose fault it is or who REALLY got the work done, but only by the executives, not the team. The culture you think you will find is no longer present, and it's quite heartbreaking. If you enjoy having an assigned desk, good luck. If you need extra peripherals at the hot desk you get assigned, or even working ones? Yeah, about that. It's now just another MS/AWS etc clone."

Low performers get away with doing nothing and still get decent performance ratings while high performers are only rewarded with more work for the same pay and often get low ratings. Managers have no idea what any of their direct reports actually do on a daily basis. They also play favorites and micromanage the people they don’t like. Long history of friends/significant others reporting to and being directly managed by each other - huge conflict of interest there but no one says anything. Promotion process is ambiguous and unclear, requires self-nomination, and there is a set quota for how many people can receive each rating. Used to be a cool, fun place to work but more and more amenities and privileges are taken away every year. Many long-term employees have rage quit mid shift, never to return again. They are laying off and firing hundreds of long-tenured employees while actively interviewing and hiring their replacements and the caliber of people they’ve been hiring lately is…questionable at best. An absolute shitshow. 0 stars, do not recommend.

Benefits. Probably what you hear about all the time, but worth reiterating. The value of the benefits will impact your total comp. at Google when directly comparing offers, but in my opinion it's a worthwhile tradeoff.","Lay offs. Not specific to Google, and the worst is behind us, true, but they continue, just quieter. The standard is high, and when it comes time for management to make a tough decision, employees are stack ranked. This won't sneak up on you, you can know pretty much how you stack up at any time, if you pay attention to available metrics and your conversations with your managers. But its a risk associated with the high pay, benefits, and career strength of a job at Google."

QA processes and requirements change every day based on mood, no logic. Yesterday's rules is incorrect today. No clarity, only chaos and blame. QA engineers are not allowed to write test cases unless they belong to a loyal inner circle. These favorites often lack basic skills, but their work is protected. QA Engineers even not allowed to file a bugs without favorite's approval. Every minute of the day is tracked in the spreadsheet - everything you do is counted, leaving no space for breathe. No trust!

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 28, 2025",Current employee,"The process we've gone through to analyze and manage the Docker images, particularly in addressing the large storage usage in the /var/lib/docker directory, has proven to be highly productive and efficient. By systematically identifying the root causes of the excessive disk usage—such as the accumulation of  tagged images, unused containers, and redundant image layers—we were able to devise a clear and actionable plan to reclaim significant disk space. The step-by-step approach, starting with checking the container references using docker ps -a, followed by removing unused containers with docker container prune, and then targeting the dangling images with commands like","docker image prune -f or the more direct docker images | grep '' | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u | xargs -r docker rmi -f, ensured that we addressed the issue comprehensively. This methodical cleanup not only reduced the storage footprint from 342GiB by approximately 70GiB by removing the  images but also set a foundation for better Docker resource management moving forward. Additionally, the process highlighted the importance of understanding Docker's image and container lifecycle, which can prevent similar issues in the future, making the overall workflow more streamlined and productive for maintaining system efficiency."

Contect writer,5.0,"Feb 28, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year","""Pros"" refers to the advantages or benefits of something. It's the opposite of ""cons."" When you're weighing the pros and cons of a decision, the ""pros"" are the positive factors to consider.
Here's a breakdown:
 * Definition:
   * Pros are the positive aspects, advantages, or benefits of a particular choice, action, or situation.
 * Usage:
   * It's commonly used in phrases like ""pros and cons,"" where you evaluate both the positive and negative aspects of something.
   * It can also be used independently to highlight the advantages of something.
   * Example: ""One of the pros of working from home is the flexibility it offers.""","The word ""cons"" can have a couple of different meanings, most commonly relating to:
 * Disadvantages:
   * This is the most frequent use, referring to the negative aspects or drawbacks of something. When discussing ""pros and cons,"" ""cons"" represent the reasons against a particular choice or action.
   * Example: ""We weighed the pros and cons of buying a new car.""
 * Confidence tricks:
   * ""Con"" can also refer to a dishonest scheme or swindle, intended to deceive someone. A ""con artist"" is someone who performs such tricks.
   * Example: ""He was a victim of a sophisticated con.""
Therefore, depending on the context, ""cons"" will either refer to negative aspects of something, or to a trick or scam."

Strategy & operations manager,2.0,"Jun 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",The microkitchens were great. Cafés were always good. The pay is top-tier.,"Google used to be a great place to work. There was a clear vision, great products, and a sense of fun in the workplace. Unfortunately, the ex-consulting management class as completely destroyed any semblance of what made this a great place to work. I watched it all happen during my 6 years at the company, from 2019-2025. Here are just a few examples:

Return-to-Office
Rather than embrace this once in a generation opportunity to reimagine work, leadership chose to double-down on meaningless office attendance tracking. Googlers are expected to commute to an office and fight for meeting room space to take video calls with colleagues across the world.

Location strategy:
Googlers in many functions are being pushes to move to lower cost locations (think Texas and Georgia) for the privilege of being paid less.

Career Growth:
Opportunities for promotion have all but evaporated. if you do want a promotion, or even a new role, expect to be asked to move to a lower cost location (see above).

Leadership
Management doesn't care about you or the product. Only about the stock price. They will tell you platitudes about coming together, about listening to feedback on surveys, about needing to do better, and then will continue to make decisions that make life worse and worse for you. Performance ratings are a moving target and everything the company does makes it seem like they're trying to make it easier to fire you or pay you less.

Product
Other than shouting ""AI!"" at every opportunity, there is no creativity left. Our products have been degraded by years of shortsighted, tight-fisted, avaricious decisions. It's a shame. We used to have the best products.

Bureaucracy
Despite all the layoffs (a topic for another day) the company is still as bureaucratic and frustrating as ever. There are teams upon teams that exist to justify their own existence, and getting things done is a struggle.

Overall there's a general sense of cowardice among the leaders of this company. There are no visionaries. Nobody wants to do anything. It's all performative leadership where directors talk about doing big things, and then nothing ever is accomplished because nobody will stick their neck out.

Google is resting on its laurels, and landing a job there isn't what it used to be."

- Cannot rely on managers for project. You need to find your own niche within your team and develop your own projects. This can be hard to do if the team seems busy with impactful projects and you are left alone trying to find work to do.
- The ""non-startup"" culture makes it easy to slack off or not seek growth. You must take care not to fall into this trap, constantly looking for skills to grow.

Resources & perks: The company provides excellent resources for designers, including top-of-the-line software, research teams, and usability labs. Plus, the perks (benefits, work environment, learning opportunities) are world-class.
User-centric approach: Google takes UX seriously, and user research is embedded in the design process. If you're passionate about data-driven design, this is an ideal place to grow.
Impactful projects: The scale at which Google operates means your work can reach millions (or billions) of users worldwide.","Slow decision-making: Despite being a fast-moving tech giant, the sheer size of Google can make getting approvals and launching new features a slow process.
Hierarchy & bureaucracy: While the culture encourages open discussion, senior leadership ultimately has a lot of control over decisions, which can sometimes make innovation feel constrained.
Work-life balance depends on the team: Some teams have a healthy work-life balance, while others expect long hours. It largely depends on your manager and project deadlines.
High expectations & competition: The bar is set high, and performance expectations are demanding. It can be a high-pressure environment, especially for those looking to advance."

- The sales team is in structural decline, so always having to do 'more with less' and stemming declines in client investment is not very exciting or motivating
- Culture: Google is not 'Google' anymore, at least not the one famed for it's best in class benefits/work environment/employees. It's becoming more and more like McKinsey, with too many paper-pushers and not enough inspirational leaders or creative ideators (very evident in the product output lately!). Increasingly non-collaborative as everyone is scared for their own jobs
- Leaders don't care about individuals (especially if you dare to have children), you are just a number on a spreadsheet, and if you speak up about how things could be improved you are shut down with ""be glad you have a job here"""

Welcome to Google’s Steve Ballmer era.

 Your experience will vary vastly from department to department, team to team and manager to manager. I’ve had amazing experiences pre-Covid, and unusutainable situations post. With internal mobility limited having a bad manager becomes much more problematic than in the past with no real solution. A good number of sales is completely burnt out and certain sectors more difficult to work in than others due to sector customer growth trajectory. Also - being front line sales to staunch a bleeding search business is inherently not fun. Corp just launched a dashboard stack ranking all AE’s against their peers, and they are testing mandatory requirements to turn on AI call listening during customer calls (this will be used in future to assess how strong the salespeople are, and downstream eventually replace the salespeople). The department I was in (large customer sales) is over managed and given far too many metrics to hit. 

Stack ranking will become a clear and present danger in the next few years due to pressure cooker environment and very aggressive goals. My sector in LCS was a rotating firing squad for the manager who didn’t hit their numbers (for reference- this is usually a % of a brands overall revenue that goes to marketing…. And with less revenue in a recession, there are already headwinds before you factor in the decline of search advertising).

No meritocracy + highly political due to stack ranking and layoff fears - showing up for customers takes a back seat to bringing in short term revenue and hitting internal metrics.  1 person does work and 9 different teams take credit.  So you have to be comfortable being that 1 in 10 that does work, or the other 9 that take credit. Pick your poison. 

Certain levels (L6) are not long for this world in GBO, and the highest difficulty level for mobility right now is L5 due to L6s taking demotions to stay at the company, and L4 wanting growth. 

I was on a front line sales specialist team and organizationally it was chaos. In last 4 years had 4 restructures, 3 different roles under 3 different managers. If you happen to be part of a toxic org don’t take it personally if you feel on a constant spin cycle. In my department you would hit a metric in Q4, then 2 months later the calculation updates and you can go from 95% feature attainment to 20% with absolutely no change from your customer. So with a poor manager you could easily be quietly let go due to performance which the numbers would support, because on paper you’re not performing (due to the constant change). This makes your manager now make or  break. 

When I left I needed to schedule and run 3 hours of internal meetings per day in order to do my job and hit my feature adoption numbers as a front line seller. Spent 5% of time speaking with customers because the products were constantly changing and breaking.  Absolute nonsense

Top leadership talent in Ads left or leaving in the last year to go outside the company. 

If a friend had an offer I’d tell them to join unless they had another MAG7 offer, but be incredibly vigilant - check in with themselves once a quarter, and be ready to leave externally at a moments notice should conditions change.","internal mobility very difficult
- turning into IBM
- bureaucracy & largely uninteresting work
- Hours can be bad (50+) depending on team
- Burnout inevitable in new paradigm
- Dispersed teams leading to an isolated work environment
- Lots of overlap and dwindling support
- dog eat dog / “what have you done today” culture
- limited learning / stalled career trajectory outside comp
- High stress hitting unrealistic metrics with limited support and control
- Ineffective middle management
- No longer stable - real and present layoff and silent layoff fears plus stack ranking make it unappealing for top performers"

The goal post is constantly moved on what is needed to progress to the point that burnout sets in. If a certain manager isn't particularly fond of you, you are blackballed from any project work.

- Depending on your team/product, it's possible to work on very high-visibility projects that look great on a resume.
- Lots of experience ""working at scale"" as per Google's favorite talking point
- It's true that most people you work with are really very smart, motivated, and proactive","- The company is moving in a direction that gives individual employees less and less freedom and judgement to do their jobs. The Google logic is: if we want people to start/stop doing something, we invest money into enforcing it. This applies to everything from minor coding style, to attendance and parking. Infringements of all kinds can result in a pay cut. The attendance policy uses your IP address to detect whether you're working from home or somewhere further away. Meeting rooms track faces, and will send you an email if not in your assigned meeting room 15 minutes into the meeting. Managers have a dashboard to see daily badge-ins.
- Very strong emphasis on hierarchy and individual ownership. Little emphasis on teams. Engineers are incentivized to ""own"" things and supervise others rather than to collaborate and help each other.
- Google is very old-fashioned in the way they do things. They live on not only a ""tech island"" but also a ""process island"". They are very invested in ""waterfall"" development style which favors writing a formal document before making any small code change, and then throwing it over the wall to a junior engineer to implement. Engineers aren't really encouraged to (or given time to) read and learn from sources outside of Google, so most engineers aren't aware of alternatives to or reasoning behind ""the google way"".
- Extremely conservative leveling and promotions. Promotions are highly political and depend heavily on your manager's motivation and presentation skills, which does not always feel very fair. You're typically pushed to operate at ""L+1"" for a year or more before you would be granted a promotion due to arbitrary requirements.
- Little support for junior developers. At lower levels, it can be really difficult to get assigned ""L+1"" projects which will allow you to be promoted. In my experience with multiple teams, it's very common for junior engineers to be isolated from the rest of the team, only getting passdowns from the engineer ""supervising"" their work and little exposure to the rest of the team. People tend to take contributions from lower-level engineers less seriously, solely based on their level, which means more friction to get your job done.
- As much as Google touts their ""fun"" spaces, and their anti-micromanagement philosophy, in practice, you get assigned way too much work to be able to make use of this. There is no time to learn and grow on your own. In all the years that I've worked for Google, I can count the number of conversations I've had with co-workers on two hands (and I'm a pretty social person). It's really not a people-centric company at all anymore."

Goog personal career","High Expectations and Pressure: Google is known for its rigorous hiring process and high-performance culture. Employees may face significant pressure to meet ambitious goals and maintain high productivity levels.
Work-Life Balance: The demanding nature of projects and the culture of innovation can lead to long hours and difficulties in maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
Bureaucracy: As a large organization, Google can have bureaucratic processes that may slow down decision-making and lead to frustration among employees who prefer a more agile work environment.
Limited Role Flexibility: While there are opportunities for movement within the company, some employees may find that their roles can become very specialized, limiting their ability to explore other areas of interest.
Competition Among Peers: The competitive atmosphere can sometimes create tension among colleagues, which may affect collaboration and workplace relationships.
Privacy Concerns: Working for a tech giant like Google can raise ethical concerns about data privacy and surveillance, potentially leading to discomfort for some employees."

General instability and a lack of job security and psychological safety. You do a lot of tap facing to “safeguard” yourself, but you’re never quite sure how to meet the mark because there’s an ever-moving goal post. If you are a serious government relations or public policy professional… do NOT work here. There are too many silos and too much internal gatekeeping and clout-chasing. Not enough execution for the sake of necessity and job function. You will spend months circling in endless internal meetings and may ultimately accomplish nothing.

Brilliant Colleagues: My team includes some of the sharpest engineers I’ve met, with expertise in everything from machine learning to backend infrastructure. Code reviews and tech talks are learning goldmines.  

World-Class Resources: Access to Google’s internal tools, massive code base, and training programs (like ML bootcamps) accelerates skill growth. The ability to experiment with new tech is unmatched.  

Compensation and Perks: Competitive salary, generous RSUs, and benefits like free gourmet meals, shuttles, and wellness stipends make life comfortable in the Bay Area.  

Flexible Work: Hybrid work policies allow a balance of in-office collaboration and remote productivity, with great office spaces in Mountain View.","Bureaucracy Creep: Google’s size means layers of approvals for major changes, slowing down project timelines. Navigating cross-team dependencies can feel like a puzzle.  

Workload Spikes: High-profile launches (e.g., new Cloud features) can lead to intense periods, with some weeks pushing 50 hours. Not every team has this issue, but it happens.  

Promotion Complexity: Advancing to senior levels is tough, requiring visible impact and advocacy. The process feels opaque, and some talented engineers get stuck.  

Tooling Overload: While internal tools are powerful, their complexity and occasional legacy quirks can frustrate new hires or slow onboarding.  

Diluted Impact: On massive projects, individual contributions can feel like a drop in the bucket, especially compared to smaller companies where impact is more direct."

Career Growth: There are endless opportunities for learning and development. Google invests heavily in its employees, and I've been able to take advantage of various training and mentorship programs.
Talented Colleagues: The people I work with are incredibly talented and passionate. It's inspiring to be part of such a high-caliber team.","Internal Competition: The competitive environment can be intense. While it can be motivating, it can also be stressful at times.
Variable Experiences: Because Google is so large, experiences can vary significantly between different teams and departments."
Virtual assistant,5.0,"Apr 9, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Excellent Compensation and Benefits: Google is known for its highly competitive salaries, bonuses, and stock options. Their benefits package is also extensive, often including generous health insurance, retirement plans with matching contributions, paid time off (vacation, sick leave, parental leave, bereavement), and various financial perks like student loan reimbursement and financial coaching.
Incredible Work-Life Balance: Many employees report a strong emphasis on work-life balance at Google. This is supported by policies like flexible work arrangements (hybrid models, remote opportunities, ""work from anywhere"" weeks), ample paid time off, and on-site amenities that help streamline daily life.
Amazing Perks and Amenities: Google's campuses are famous for their perks, which can include free gourmet meals and snacks, on-site gyms, wellness centers, massage programs, laundry services, transportation, and even pet-friendly policies in some locations. These perks aim to create a comfortable and supportive work environment.

Excellent Internal Tools and Documentation: Google provides its employees with highly advanced internal tools and comprehensive documentation, which can make workflows more efficient and transitions between teams smoother.","Slow Approval Processes: Due to the size and complexity of the organization, approval processes for projects and initiatives can sometimes be slow and involve multiple layers.
Limited Scope on Some Teams: Depending on the team, some employees might find their work focused on specific components rather than end-to-end features, potentially limiting the learning curve and overall impact on a single project.
Career Progression Challenges: Work done in a previous team might not always be fully considered for promotions after switching teams, potentially leading to slower career advancement for some individuals.
High Competition: Getting a job at Google is highly competitive, and the internal environment can also be competitive among talented individuals.
Potential for Bureaucracy: As a large company, Google can sometimes have bureaucratic processes that might slow things down or feel cumbersome.
Privacy Concerns: Some critics and employees have raised concerns about Google's data handling practices and their potential impact on user privacy.
Return-to-Office Mandates: Recent shifts towards hybrid work models and return-to-office mandates have been met with some resistance from employees who enjoyed the flexibility of fully remote work.
Layoffs and Restructuring: Like other tech companies, Google has experienced layoffs and restructuring, which can create uncertainty and impact employee morale.
""Big Company"" Feel: For some, the sheer size of Google can make it feel less like a start up and more like a large corporation, with potentially less individual impact on the overall direction of the company."

Product manager,3.0,"Apr 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Google is very flexible and respectful of your time and work/life priorities. People choose to lean in or lean back from their work depending on what works best for them. Medical leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, personal leave, and carers leave and all sorts of other benefits mean that this is really a job you can make work around anything else going on in your life.

With the new work on LLMs, Google search is also more exciting to work on again. We were already so optimized before, it was difficult to create anything fun and new. Now with new technology, there are more cool projects that feel innovative.","People do sometimes phone it in, and that can be frustrating if you are trying to accomplish something. That isn't my main concern, however. Within search, the director and above leadership seems incompetent. Comparing notes with colleagues, our guesses are: 1) They don't know how to build anything, 2) They have strange incentives are are playing their own games, 3) They are sociopaths 4) They are focused on their families and collecting 7-figure paychecks on the couch. My guess is #2-4. There are a few gems in leadership, but it's not enough.

Some managers are great, but most managers make you scratch your head. Given how promotions work at Google, becoming a manager as an engineer or as a PM has very little to do with skill, and much more to do with luck, time at the company, and how good your own manager was. There are many people I work with who are amazing, and there are also many Google lifers I do not believe would pass the hiring bar for managers if they started interviewing outside the company."

Inside sales acount manager,3.0,"Mar 29, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","The food is good, but dinner is served late, feels like a tactic to keep you in the office longer.","If you’re looking for career development outside your immediate role, forget it. The company operates like a closed club, especially for the German market from Dublin, where networking and internal connections matter more than skills or performance. There’s little to no chance of moving beyond your current position unless you’re part of the inner circle.

The work environment is heavily driven by KPIs, with constant pressure to perform and outdo colleagues. Instead of fostering collaboration, the culture encourages internal competition, making long term motivation difficult. The focus on short term numbers and performance metrics creates a stressful atmosphere, with little regard for employee well being or professional growth.

The German market, whether managed from Dublin or Germany itself, is purely a marketing and sales organization. There is no real career development outside of these areas, making it impossible to grow beyond your initial role. Internal mobility is nearly non existent unless you have the right connections, and roles outside of sales and marketing are extremely limited.

At its core, the company operates like a call center, especially for sales roles. The focus is on making many calls and closing as many deals as possible, with little strategic thinking or real customer engagement. Employees are expected to follow rigid scripts, hit aggressive targets, and move on to the next lead. Creativity, problem solving, and long term customer relationships take a back seat to short term revenue generation.

In recent years, the company has increasingly felt the pressure from competitors, which has only made the work environment more stressful. Instead of adapting with innovation or long term strategies, leadership has responded by tightening KPIs and increasing micromanagement. The result is an even more high pressure, unsustainable culture where employees are pushed harder without any real investment in their growth or success.

On the positive side, if you’re okay with a rigid structure and thrive under continuous performance measurement, this might be a place for you. But for those seeking a supportive and forward thinking company with real career opportunities, it’s best to look elsewhere. Leaving feels more like a relief than a loss."

Software engineer,5.0,"Sep 9, 2024",Former employee,"Innovative Work Environment: Google is known for being at the forefront of technology, offering opportunities to work on cutting-edge projects in AI, cloud computing, and more.

Career Growth: Google offers excellent learning and development opportunities, including mentorship, technical training, and career advancement.

Great Compensation and Benefits: Competitive salary packages, including stock options, bonuses, and comprehensive healthcare benefits, are a big plus.

Work-Life Balance: Despite high expectations, many Googlers report a reasonable work-life balance, with flexible working hours and remote work options.

Collaborative Culture: Google's flat organizational structure encourages open communication and collaboration across teams.

Perks: Free meals, transportation, gyms, and on-campus wellness services make life easier.

Impact: Working on products used by billions of people globally gives employees a sense of purpose and impact.","High Competition: Google is full of high-performing individuals, which can sometimes make it feel competitive or hard to stand out.

Bureaucracy: As Google has grown, it has developed layers of bureaucracy, which can slow decision-making or create red tape.

Limited Mobility: While career growth is encouraged, some employees find it challenging to move between teams or departments due to internal competition.

Pressure to Perform: The high-performance culture can lead to stress, especially when working on high-visibility projects with tight deadlines.

Large Company Feel: Some people may feel lost in such a large organization, where it's easy to become a small cog in a giant machine.

Frequent Re-orgs: Google's internal teams often go through re-organizations, which can disrupt workflows and cause uncertainty.

Remote vs. Onsite Tensions: Despite remote options, there is still some tension between fully remote employees and those based in large offices, especially in terms of collaboration and visibility."

In Taiwan, this is likely to be very attractive, combined with a comprehensive benefits package that often includes health insurance, retirement plans, and various employee perks.

Innovative and Impactful Work: Google is a global leader in technology, and working there offers the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects that impact millions of users worldwide. This can be very motivating and provide significant career growth.

Positive Work Culture: Google is famous for its employee-centric culture. This often translates to a comfortable and stimulating work environment with a focus on collaboration, creativity, and work-life balance. Google Taiwan likely embodies many of these cultural aspects.

Career Development Opportunities: Google provides ample opportunities for professional development, including training programs, internal mobility, and the chance to work with talented colleagues from diverse backgrounds.

Location and Quality of Life: Taiwan offers a high quality of life with a relatively low cost of living compared to many other tech hubs. It's known for its friendly people, delicious food, vibrant culture, and beautiful scenery. Working at Google in Taiwan allows you to enjoy these benefits.","Potential for Bureaucracy: As a large multinational corporation, Google may have bureaucratic processes that can sometimes slow down decision-making and project execution.

Competition: Google attracts top talent, so there can be a highly competitive environment. This could create pressure to constantly perform at a high level.

Work-Life Balance Challenges: While Google aims for good work-life balance, the demands of working for a global tech giant can sometimes lead to long hours or the need to be available outside of typical work hours.

Salary Differences: While compensation is generally good, salaries in Google Taiwan may be lower compared to those in the United States for similar roles.

Limited Scope: Depending on the specific role and team in Taiwan, there might be fewer opportunities to work on certain cutting-edge projects compared to Google's headquarters."

Manager,1.0,"Nov 2, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years",Pays good. People on the outside still think Google is a good company.,"Poor business discipline. OKRs, goal setting, fact checking - exists in theory but not in practice. It's all slideware and moving numbers around to make it look like people are working on impactful projects while very little actually gets done.

I watched a team struggle for the better part of a year to build a simple dashboard so that executives could know where key inventory was located and how much of it was available. They seem to struggle with processes that any non-tech supply chain or retail organization does extremely well.

Folks in Cloud are gaming the hiring committee to bring in nepotism hires that seem incapable of bringing about measurable business impact. They are contributing to the lack of transparency and covering for each other's misconduct.

Org structures are set up to fail. Managers communicate almost exclusively through TPMs to avoid accountability for their decisions, Bad actors create information bottlenecks where all status reports or leadership direction flow up and down only through them. I have observed individuals spread disinformation under the guise of executive direction. These same people misrepresent project information upward in a way that is convenient for their own careers, usually at the expensive of another employee. Constant infighting disrupts the pace of business."

With access to cutting-edge technology and mentorship from industry experts, interns gain invaluable skills and experience. The collaborative culture fosters creativity and diverse perspectives, while competitive compensation and perks enhance the overall experience. Additionally, the chance to network within a globally recognized company not only bolsters resumes but also opens doors for future career opportunities. Overall, a Google internship is a transformative experience that can significantly shape one's professional journey.","While interning at Google offers many benefits, there are also some potential downsides. The highly competitive environment can be overwhelming for some interns, leading to stress and pressure to perform at a high level. Additionally, the sheer size of the company may result in interns feeling like just another number, with limited direct interaction with top executives or decision-makers. Interns might also encounter a steep learning curve, especially if they lack experience with the specific tools or technologies used within their teams. Furthermore, the focus on performance metrics can create a challenging atmosphere where interns feel the need to constantly prove their value. Lastly, the cost of living in areas where Google offices are located, such as Silicon Valley, can be prohibitively high, making it difficult for some interns to manage their finances effectively."

Gone are the days where Google values people first. Now, everyone is just a number and a means to an end in getting anything done. And the ""do more with less"" mantra is highly used. Many folks are taking mental health leave for stress, burnout, and complete dissatisfaction with their jobs. The culture is now dog-eat-dog. Your opinions are not valued. They want you to do what you're told, keep your head done, and stay silent. You aren't valued for your brain here anymore. In fact, expressing an opinion or an opposing view to any senior execs will have you fired. There is no psych safety and everyone clings on to just having a job and a large paycheck.

Software developer,5.0,"Feb 25, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year","One of my favorite perks of working at Google India was sleeping in the office cabs on my way to home after a hectic day at work. Also, the cab service is only offered in India. In US, Google provides a shuttle service but the cab service doesn’t exist in any other country (to the best of my knowledge).
Talking about wallets, the security is pretty great. You can leave your wallet, watch, laptop etc. anywhere in the office and can expect to find it back in the same place the next day or with security. In my 2 years at Google, I never heard of anyone’s stuff getting stolen.
Most roles allow for some overseas travel opportunities. I went on a business trip to Europe. I followed all the guidelines for daily allowances (which is pretty generous) and wasn't asked a single question about it. I had drinks when I wanted to and had all kinds of exotic food on the company's card. Some Companies are cost driven where as Google is Value driven. (The cost of asking for business justification for each & every bill is more expensive than letting the employee do some productive work in that time. See point no. 4 under culture)","Google India offers very limited scope for career growth. You obviously can’t become the CEO/SVP/VP working from India when more than 80% of your workforce is based out of Mountain View. The roles in India are very limited too since only a handful organisations are based out of India.

Sooner than later, anyone, who has some iota of ambition and are not constrained by family, move to Mountain View. (The internal mobility is pretty great by the way minus the tons of competition for good roles. See point no. 1)
Google runs a lot of programs to train its management and provides a lot of support to its employees to keep them stress free and remove all politics from the workplace. However, Google is a system run by people and at the end of the day people are flawed. Some politics does creep into the picture. It might be comparatively less than many other places but it does exist."

Accountant,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Health & Dental Benefits + Equity.,"5.8% of the company made up of African & African Americans.
The promise of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives often falls short, as funding meant to support HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and programs for Black professionals in tech can sometimes serve as a superficial effort, rather than creating real change within companies. Many Black employees struggle to advance into leadership positions, facing a lack of genuine support and mentorship. In contrast, White and Asian employees often receive more direct support, as these groups are more prominently represented in leadership roles.

Google’s ""Stay & Thrive"" program, for instance, aims to assist employees who identify as Black, Hispanic, or Native American when they encounter challenges with their managers. This program helps them find new roles within the company without their current manager’s knowledge. However, while a few Black employees may receive support through such initiatives, it’s a small percentage—around 1%.

Given this reality, it's crucial for Black professionals to cultivate their own businesses and alternative income streams outside of major tech companies like Google. While these companies are often celebrated, the reality can be different for underrepresented groups, and the intellectual capabilities of Black professionals are sometimes met with discomfort or resistance within these spaces."

Staff software engineer,4.0,"Jan 18, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","- Good benefits
- Good pay overall for a software engineer, but pay last few years starting to stagnate compared to other Big Tech. I would not say Google pays very top of market anymore, despite what they would claim.
- Internal software development stack is generally pretty good, with some exceptions.
- Lot's of innovative and interesting projects still going on, despite the size if the company. You just need to find the right group to work with and it can be great, find the wrong one and it can be boring and have dysfunctional culture dynamics going on.","- The culture from up top as changed dramatically, Google's leadership has dropped the ball in terms of company culture for many years now and they simply don't care about fixing it. It certainly could be much worse, there are plenty of places to work with more dysfunctional and terrible cultures, but the magical awesome culture Google was known for from top to bottom is dead and has been dead for a long time. And it's clear leadership considers this a feature, not a bug.
- Promotions outside of Senior have gotten much harder as Google as focused on belt-tightening. It's becoming much harder to be recognized and pay raises are not as good as they use to be. Not bad, but they are no longer paying very top of market, unless of course you have some special skills with AI (PhD, worked at an well-known AI start-up, etc.).
- Lot's of legacy systems and code to deal with, of wide varying quality. Pretty standard stuff considering the age of the company, but you need to be comfortable learning about really old systems that have gotten crufty over time. And expect a hard time getting the time & resources to make the improvements that really are necessary."

Google still pays top of market for this role and many others. Very few other tech companies pay their Solutions Consultants similar amounts of money.

Google still has a good reputation in the industry overall, so it will be helpful to have their name on your resume if looking elsewhere.","Politics. A lot of effort needs to be put into impressing managers with the ""great work"" you have done. However the work we do in my org is not groundbreaking. A lot of it is low impact and borderline meaningless. Regardless you have to put on a whole show for managers and your peers so you can get a decent performance review.

Despite the stock being at an all-time high, the org is very unstable right now and we have been waiting for layoffs for over half a year at this point. Most of us assume one is coming, so we're just waiting. It's difficult to focus on work and be happy at work when a layoff is in the back of your mind.

Internal mobility is very restricted at the moment. Few teams are hiring, so you are kind of stuck where you are at.

Even though the perks have disappeared, most of the perks and opportunities are still good. There is definitely name recognition.","It feels like more of a conventional company than when I started. There is constant fear of layoffs, and while most people are great, there are some toxic engineers. There is a fair amount of pressure, but the bureaucracy is pretty intense to keep you from moving fast.

It is strongly hierarchical and current leaders lack vision and cater to the shareholders.

Software engineer,1.0,"Apr 8, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years",Good to have on your CV.,"It's just too intense. There is constant pressure to deliver ""perfect"" and scaleable solutions. Performance review is overly bureaucratic. Promotions are unfair: it mostly depends on how good your manager is and how well people know you. As a result, everyone constantly wastes time in pointless meetings and talking about their work just to gain visibility, as oppose to actually working. Risk-taking is not rewarded; you should not bother spending time on projects that are not guaranteed to succeed. It is better to land a mediocre incomplete product that will live long enough to get you promoted before getting killed off. The team I was on saw many of the most senior VPs and directors abandoning the project when they saw that it wasn't profitable, which is unfair because those at are bottom of hierarchy do not have access to these profit margins, but they end up paying the cost of the failure. Quantity is highly favoured and quality is silently punished. For example, I interviewed many candidates and spend a lot of time and effort to ensure that my interview reports were well-written and detailed, but I noticed that my colleagues hardly cared about this and wrote short and appallingly written reports. Guess which interviewer was shamed on? Me, because apparently I was ""slower"" than my peers. I want to say that the layoffs made things worse, but I'm starting to thinking that's not true. If anything, what the layoffs did is really just shred light on everything that's wrong with the company."

Google's dedication to employee growth, with ongoing training and development opportunities, has not only enhanced my skills but also provided a clear path for career progression.

Google's emphasis on work-life balance, reflected in flexible arrangements and comprehensive wellness programs, has contributed to a positive and thriving work atmosphere. Transparent communication from leadership fosters a sense of trust and unity, making Google not just a workplace but a community. In summary, Google stands out as an outstanding place to work, offering a supportive culture, ample growth opportunities, and a healthy work-life balance. I highly recommend Google to those seeking a fulfilling and rewarding career.","While Google is undoubtedly a remarkable company to work for, like any workplace, it's essential to consider potential challenges. Here are some cons to be aware of:

Intense Work Environment: Google is known for its fast-paced and dynamic work environment. For some individuals, the pressure and pace may be challenging to manage, leading to potential stress or burnout.

Large Organization Challenges: Being a massive multinational corporation, Google's sheer size can sometimes result in bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes. Navigating through the organizational hierarchy may require patience and persistence.

High Expectations: Google sets high expectations for its employees, aiming for innovation and excellence. While this can be motivating, it may also create a demanding atmosphere where meeting and exceeding expectations becomes the norm."
