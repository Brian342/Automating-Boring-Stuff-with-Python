Program manager,4.0,"Jun 21, 2013","Former employee, more than 8 years","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("
Software engineer iii,5.0,"May 10, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Feb 8, 2015",Current employee,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."
Program manager,4.0,"Aug 5, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, intelligent and down to earth people (for the most part), and despite there being a lot disgruntled employees about the continued layoffs and mixed feelings about Sundar, Google still really is an exciting place to work with a lot of potential opportunity given the AI movement.","The truth is you could get laid off at any point... and this is coming from someone who was given the highest performance rating possible in 2024. Even if you're hired in August of this year, by Feb of next year there's a real chance leadership has made some top down decision to slash roles in your org or to prioritize a different location for your org. The environment at Google has been increasingly tense and stressful the last 3 years. Managers and those around you are more and more panicked, so it's only naturally that you'll feel the consequences of this in your day to day (bottom line, it's becoming a more stressful place to work and expectations are increasing each month),"
Software development engineer (sde),4.0,"Jul 28, 2025",Former employee,"Google is also known for offering generous benefits, a flexible work environment, and a focus on personal development and learning. The diversity of projects and the impact their work can have globally is another big draw for those who work there. Would you like to know more about specific aspects of Google's work culture","While many employees enjoy working at Google, some challenges have been reported by others. These can include:
1. **High Expectations**: Google has a reputation for hiring top talent, which means there's often pressure to meet high expectations and deliver results quickly.

2. **Intense Workload**: The fast-paced, constantly evolving nature of the tech industry can result in long hours or a sense of burnout for some employees.
3. **Internal Competition**: With such a large pool of talented people, some individuals might feel a competitive atmosphere that can be stressful.
4. **Work-Life Balance**: While Google offers flexible work options, the sheer volume of work and the company's fast pace may make it challenging for some employees to maintain a balance between work and personal life.
5. **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Despite its reputation for innovation, the company is still large and can have bureaucratic layers that may slow decision-making or innovation for some teams.
Of course, these experiences can vary widely depending on the team, role, and individual preferences."
Account manager,1.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Benefits, Colleagues, Pay, Dog friendly and free food.
Overall its a great environment with plenty of perks, amazing people and opportunities to move and learn.","Everything here depends on your direct manager. You will either get a genuine leader who invests in your growth and success or a someone who pretends but is only there to make themselves look good and will actively make your life hell to push you out.

Holier than thou attitudes of middle managers make it very a very toxic and two-faced environment. If you don't follow blindly you will be pushed out of the company under the facade of ""support"". 

Expectations seem to be different for people in the same role depending on if a manager likes you or not.

Untrustworthy people in influential positions who play the politics game instead of actually serving customers. 

HR dont take reports of bullying and discrimination seriously enough.

They don't actually care about customers and doing things the right way, its a fake customer first mindset while you're forced to shove products down businesses throats even though it could ruin their business.

Overall - be very cautious of the people around you, because behind the smiles, fake ""we're a team and support each other"" talk and ""Googliness"", there are some who want you to fail."

High Expectations

The bar for performance is very high, and there’s pressure to constantly prove your impact.

Internal Competition

Promotions and top projects can be competitive. Visibility matters, and self-promotion is sometimes necessary.

Less Autonomy (in some roles)

In well-established teams, PMs may not have the autonomy to define the full product vision or roadmap.

Geographical Constraints

Some of the most exciting projects are tied to specific locations like Mountain View, which can limit flexibility."

Engineer,5.0,"Jul 31, 2025",Current employee,"Advantages
High - salary and good benefits: Google offers generous compensation, enabling employees to earn substantial income. Additionally, the company provides outstanding welfare facilities, such as on - site swimming pools, world - class gyms, various sports classes, weekly massages, delicious and healthy meals, and on - site medical care, which contribute to employees' high - quality lifestyle.
Strong technical strength and learning opportunities: As a world - leading technology company, Google possesses cutting - edge technologies. Employees have the chance to access and learn these advanced technologies, enhancing their technical skills and professional competence. They can also gain valuable experience in dealing with complex engineering problems and world - class crisis management and debugging.
Good work - life balance: Google emphasizes a healthy work - life balance, allowing employees to maintain a relatively reasonable working hours and workload, which is conducive to their physical and mental health and the balance between work and life.
Positive corporate culture and excellent colleagues: The company has a positive corporate culture that encourages creativity and innovation. Employees can collaborate with talented professionals from diverse backgrounds, which not only promotes teamwork but also broadens their horizons.
Abundant career development opportunities: Google is committed to the personal and professional development of employees, providing various training programs and workshops. Employees have the opportunity to be promoted and can also explore different job roles and projects within the company, which is helpful for their career growth.","Disadvantages
High - pressure work and high cognitive load: Some positions at Google, such as site reliability engineering, may involve long - term on - call work, which can cause stress to employees and disrupt their sleep. Moreover, Google's technical systems are extremely complex, and employees need to remember numerous systems and technologies, facing a high cognitive load.
Unclear career progression: Career progression at Google can be challenging and depends a lot on the specific projects an employee is involved in. Some employees may find themselves stuck at a certain level, such as level 5, with limited opportunities for further promotion.
Serious internal politics: As the company grows, internal politics may become more prominent. In some aspects, such as performance management and recruitment, managers may need to engage in a lot of negotiation and manipulation, which can affect employees' work enthusiasm and morale.
Cultural differences and marginalization of non - US employees: Google has a strong US - centered culture. Employees who do not work in the US and do not have much influence in their locations may feel isolated or marginalized, and may also be troubled by late - night meetings due to time zone differences.
High - intensity competition: Google hires a large number of outstanding talents, resulting in fierce competition among employees. Everyone is highly qualified, and employees need to work hard to stand out, which may bring a lot of pressure."
Administrative,3.0,"May 28, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years",They offer a good wage package and the opportunity to do really amazing work if you have a decent team and leader. The campuses are beautiful.,"Promotion is all political and nearly impossible; it also eats up any managers  time FAR more than it needs to. Remote workers do not get any benefits like onsite workers do (ie free food, gym access, massage time, etc) - not even a gym stipend. Additionally management cannot make up their mind what is important when and change priorities constantly, which then spurs a big argument over either whose fault it is or who REALLY got the work done, but only by the executives, not the team. The culture you think you will find is no longer present, and it's quite heartbreaking. If you enjoy having an assigned desk, good luck. If you need extra peripherals at the hot desk you get assigned, or even working ones? Yeah, about that. It's now just another MS/AWS etc clone."

Low performers get away with doing nothing and still get decent performance ratings while high performers are only rewarded with more work for the same pay and often get low ratings. Managers have no idea what any of their direct reports actually do on a daily basis. They also play favorites and micromanage the people they don’t like. Long history of friends/significant others reporting to and being directly managed by each other - huge conflict of interest there but no one says anything. Promotion process is ambiguous and unclear, requires self-nomination, and there is a set quota for how many people can receive each rating. Used to be a cool, fun place to work but more and more amenities and privileges are taken away every year. Many long-term employees have rage quit mid shift, never to return again. They are laying off and firing hundreds of long-tenured employees while actively interviewing and hiring their replacements and the caliber of people they’ve been hiring lately is…questionable at best. An absolute shitshow. 0 stars, do not recommend.

Benefits. Probably what you hear about all the time, but worth reiterating. The value of the benefits will impact your total comp. at Google when directly comparing offers, but in my opinion it's a worthwhile tradeoff.","Lay offs. Not specific to Google, and the worst is behind us, true, but they continue, just quieter. The standard is high, and when it comes time for management to make a tough decision, employees are stack ranked. This won't sneak up on you, you can know pretty much how you stack up at any time, if you pay attention to available metrics and your conversations with your managers. But its a risk associated with the high pay, benefits, and career strength of a job at Google."

QA processes and requirements change every day based on mood, no logic. Yesterday's rules is incorrect today. No clarity, only chaos and blame. QA engineers are not allowed to write test cases unless they belong to a loyal inner circle. These favorites often lack basic skills, but their work is protected. QA Engineers even not allowed to file a bugs without favorite's approval. Every minute of the day is tracked in the spreadsheet - everything you do is counted, leaving no space for breathe. No trust!

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 28, 2025",Current employee,"The process we've gone through to analyze and manage the Docker images, particularly in addressing the large storage usage in the /var/lib/docker directory, has proven to be highly productive and efficient. By systematically identifying the root causes of the excessive disk usage—such as the accumulation of  tagged images, unused containers, and redundant image layers—we were able to devise a clear and actionable plan to reclaim significant disk space. The step-by-step approach, starting with checking the container references using docker ps -a, followed by removing unused containers with docker container prune, and then targeting the dangling images with commands like","docker image prune -f or the more direct docker images | grep '' | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u | xargs -r docker rmi -f, ensured that we addressed the issue comprehensively. This methodical cleanup not only reduced the storage footprint from 342GiB by approximately 70GiB by removing the  images but also set a foundation for better Docker resource management moving forward. Additionally, the process highlighted the importance of understanding Docker's image and container lifecycle, which can prevent similar issues in the future, making the overall workflow more streamlined and productive for maintaining system efficiency."

Contect writer,5.0,"Feb 28, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year","""Pros"" refers to the advantages or benefits of something. It's the opposite of ""cons."" When you're weighing the pros and cons of a decision, the ""pros"" are the positive factors to consider.
Here's a breakdown:
 * Definition:
   * Pros are the positive aspects, advantages, or benefits of a particular choice, action, or situation.
 * Usage:
   * It's commonly used in phrases like ""pros and cons,"" where you evaluate both the positive and negative aspects of something.
   * It can also be used independently to highlight the advantages of something.
   * Example: ""One of the pros of working from home is the flexibility it offers.""","The word ""cons"" can have a couple of different meanings, most commonly relating to:
 * Disadvantages:
   * This is the most frequent use, referring to the negative aspects or drawbacks of something. When discussing ""pros and cons,"" ""cons"" represent the reasons against a particular choice or action.
   * Example: ""We weighed the pros and cons of buying a new car.""
 * Confidence tricks:
   * ""Con"" can also refer to a dishonest scheme or swindle, intended to deceive someone. A ""con artist"" is someone who performs such tricks.
   * Example: ""He was a victim of a sophisticated con.""
Therefore, depending on the context, ""cons"" will either refer to negative aspects of something, or to a trick or scam."

Strategy & operations manager,2.0,"Jun 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",The microkitchens were great. Cafés were always good. The pay is top-tier.,"Google used to be a great place to work. There was a clear vision, great products, and a sense of fun in the workplace. Unfortunately, the ex-consulting management class as completely destroyed any semblance of what made this a great place to work. I watched it all happen during my 6 years at the company, from 2019-2025. Here are just a few examples:

Return-to-Office
Rather than embrace this once in a generation opportunity to reimagine work, leadership chose to double-down on meaningless office attendance tracking. Googlers are expected to commute to an office and fight for meeting room space to take video calls with colleagues across the world.

Location strategy:
Googlers in many functions are being pushes to move to lower cost locations (think Texas and Georgia) for the privilege of being paid less.

Career Growth:
Opportunities for promotion have all but evaporated. if you do want a promotion, or even a new role, expect to be asked to move to a lower cost location (see above).

Leadership
Management doesn't care about you or the product. Only about the stock price. They will tell you platitudes about coming together, about listening to feedback on surveys, about needing to do better, and then will continue to make decisions that make life worse and worse for you. Performance ratings are a moving target and everything the company does makes it seem like they're trying to make it easier to fire you or pay you less.

Product
Other than shouting ""AI!"" at every opportunity, there is no creativity left. Our products have been degraded by years of shortsighted, tight-fisted, avaricious decisions. It's a shame. We used to have the best products.

Bureaucracy
Despite all the layoffs (a topic for another day) the company is still as bureaucratic and frustrating as ever. There are teams upon teams that exist to justify their own existence, and getting things done is a struggle.

Overall there's a general sense of cowardice among the leaders of this company. There are no visionaries. Nobody wants to do anything. It's all performative leadership where directors talk about doing big things, and then nothing ever is accomplished because nobody will stick their neck out.

Google is resting on its laurels, and landing a job there isn't what it used to be."
