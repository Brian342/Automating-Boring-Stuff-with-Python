Anonymous employee,3.0,Benefits of medical cover Airtime in plenty,No time for Self Little pay for much output
Senior engineer,3.0,"Flexible work environment- very good for expectant mothers and young families. Management is understanding when it comes to health and family issues. Good facilities and amenities which include a gym, medical clinic, cafeteria, and a center which hosts several events ( although you will not get cheaper tickets by virtue of being an employee). Benefits include pension, medical, annual bonus. They also have a good SACCO and an investment cooperative for those keen on saving an extra penny or getting cheap loans.",You will be overworked and paid half the amount you would get for a similar job in another company. Growth is very slow. The company introduced a tiered structure which several job groups are in one level. You can move in terms of job group but your salary remains the same. Very difficult to grow especially if a starter since you have to wait for vacancies to fill up. It is a good company to learn and move to greener pastures. Also the annual increment is tied down to a percentage which cannot go beyond 10-15% and that is if you are an exceptional worker otherwise you get meager salary increments.
Senior manager enterprise service delivery,5.0,Great place to work. Challenging and high performance culture. The company places great emphasis on employee well being. The company invests in top class training for its employees.,"Very competitive and the downside to this is that company politics often impedes better performance. Very low turnover and so there are very few opportunities to grow. Cut throat culture often means that it is survival for fittest. 
Fix the procurement to make sure we get value for money"
Customer experience executive,3.0,Well the best place to learn customer service.The processes and procedures are streamlined so you work in shifts .You can be a robot just doing same thing every other day.So if you love being a robot... there you have it,"Well who loves being a robot?
Plus there are few growth opportunities for anyone who wants to grow through the ranks.Many staff members have been in same position for over 8 years,you only get to go for a job rotation in a different department .Interview process is warped the interviewer knows who they are giving the job.so many times qualified staff missed opportunities because the boss prefers working with their""friends"".
In safaricom you must (this is important) you must make the boss like you.otherwise your good performance is nothing really.
There are politics on everything,be ready to play corporate politics.
Duplication of roles, so there is confusion on the function of HR.You find that in retail there is workforce management that retail department people liase with.You go to call centre and still they have a small mini Workforce team.
What the hell does the HR function do?
There is bureaucRacy because of all this duplication of functions.
So many roles are duplicated ?I figured so many people dont even deliver  at HQ yet at the retail and call centre guys are having a hard time hitting targets and serving customers and they have nowhere to grow their careers.
There should be a serious restructuring.
Some bosses are small Gods, Please choose your boss wisely.
In safaricom your boss will throw you under the bus real quick .Cover your self with emails and just do a great job.
Sucking up is a requirement.Few bosses are deaf to feedback.So just do what the boss says even if it makes no logic at all.
Lawd have mercy."
Principal radio planning engineer,3.0,"It's a company where the brightest minds are, great workplace culture and values. Everyone knows their purpose and value and essence of working towards a goal.
Team based structure is a great way to work.
Young and energetic team structure.
Anyone gets to gain great work experience and appreciation of team effort.","Pay is below industry standard, not unless you come from outside the organization.
Bonus is measly considering it is the most profitable company in east and central Africa.
Relationship based work ethic means that knowing someone gets the job done better than following process.
While team structure is great...It's a disadvantage for a big team as growth is slow/impossible.
Politicking is rife, with many growth positions based on political alignment, favouritism rules!"
Retail analyst,2.0,"Free airtime and great medical cover, There is alot of tea in safaricom,","Bureaucracy ,Poor pay, Favouritism,No growth plan,Qliques of Big Fish small fish and no fish ,mkubwa this,Cosmetics to boss,the boss is EVERYTHING, uniform especially for front serving representative"
Mid level manager,3.0,Great exposure in terms of learning opportunities both through formal training as well as on the job learning.,"Hierarchical to a fault with a lot of bureaucracy evidenced. A culture of fear, the response to mistakes on the job in many departments are very punitive,  lack of accountability and a lack of work-life balance despite a lot of lip service on work-life balance every other year, lack of growth internally, silo way of working with a lack of involvement in decision making by senior management."
Human resources officer,2.0,"- Policies and procedures are clear. This protects the employees
- Great benefits (medical, ESOP, training)
- Great opportunities to learn. Having worked at Safaricom, one can work in any environment and comfortably handle the pressure","- Often overworked and sometimes the pay is not adequate
- Bad leadership. Managers operate like they have little kingdoms
- Tribalism in appointments and promotions especially Hr, finance, retail and risk departments
- Culture of blame game"
Software engineer,3.0,"It's a really good place especially if you are looking for experience since you get to learn a lot.
The pay is good.","Just lots of pressure.
In terms of growth, it's really difficult."
Software engineer,5.0,Safaricom is one of the best companies to work for in Kenya. It is among the most profitable organizations in East and Central Africa.,"Cronyism is rife in many Kenyan companies especially when the CEO is also a Kenyan. Safaricom has been headed by ex-pats but recently got its first local CEO. There are fears this habit might render its head in the company but at the time of this review, Safaricom was still regarded as an equal opportunity employer."
Customer experience executive,5.0,"Safaricom offers very good salaries and very good benefits like health, regular training programmes. During training there is maximum care of employees like air tickets, reputable cabs and accommodation at five star hotels. Their working environment are very friendly.",Very long working hours. Customers are very many and there is no time to rest. One is normally very busy through out the day.
Tdr trade development representative,5.0,"My best reason to work at Safaricom it's that Safaricom is Simple, transparent, Honest for everyone who needs help and services from it and it meets His customers needs","You are fully responsible and answerable for tasks given, it is challenging and pressure can really build up at some point. If you are up for a big challenge."
Security controller,2.0,"-Free calling while at work.
-Possible to do long-distance learning during night shifts
-No defined job valuation requirement [yet], e.g. KPIs, SPIs, like permanent staff
-Fair pay [though meagre]
-Autonomous working/valued opinion, i.e. controller's deduction on OP issues is occasionally/often valued  & actioned upon by mgt.","-Long working hours at low pay .
-Lack of growth opportunities
-Lack of motivation from leadership
-Lack of allowances
-Controlled WiFi access
-No special training facility before one deploys.
-Lack of adequate support from leadership"
Customer service representative,4.0,"Overall the company gives good benefits from health coverage, transportation to and from work, team building, bonuses .",You are likely to get stuck in the same role for years because employees are very many and most managers promote based on friendship and favourism. There were also cases of nepotism. So it depends who you know if you want to grow.
Senior manager - retail transformation,5.0,"It is the most profitable company which is very innovative hence is very dynamic. It has very good benefits, cares for the employees as well as transforms people's lives and remunerates very well.","One has to be very fast in turn around hence if not, you could miss the bus. Is a company with a regional structure and any employee can work anywhere countrywide which may affect some families."
Ipcc engineer,5.0,"Safaricom is a great place to work, you get to manage your time and work items, No micromanagement. You get to fully own your space and make Engineering decisions as you see fit. I loved it. The benefits are very decent. There is Job security.","The work can be overwhelming, depending on the team you land on. career growth is very limited and involves switching to management."
Senior management,3.0,The company really tries to take care of its staff by giving salary and benefits that are top notch.,A company is only as good as its employees. It's a man-eat-man culture and if your not willing to play the game then you will get pushed out. No apologies made. Work life balance is difficult to achieve because of the work load.
Corporate ressponsibility,5.0,"It has the best working environment.It is corruption free, everyone is treated equally irrespective of titles. It is passionate on sustainability and thus strives to ensure that all goals are met.",Internship is not a guarantee for job consideration in the company. This is probably because of the need to provide vacancies of internship to others.
Procurement intern,5.0,"-great positive energy amongst the staff
-team work and group support highly valued
-respect for people
-fun activities that facilitate bonding like the TGIF's and staff competitions
-free airtime!","unless one creates the cons, I believe the environment there is good enough for one to srive in their career"
Training coordinator,3.0,Helps me interact with alot of people and also helps me to help people in anyway i can.it feels well to go home knowing you have helped someone.,"when there are is alot of pressure and i need to get my work done in time and i have not done that, it makes one feel like you are doing nothing."
Intern,4.0,"The pay is just enough to sustain an intern. 
There are lots of goodies every now and then.
The team buildings are so awesome.","It can get really busy more so when some services are experiencing downtime and one may be forced to put in many extra hours. For an intern though, I saw that as an extra opportunity to learn a little more.
I never got any overtime pay as an intern"
Brand manager,4.0,"The relatively young company cultivates an innovative culture that pushes the company head-and-shoulders above regional players in the industry, and even creating globally celebrated products such as M-PESA.
This has made Safaricom one the greatest talent pools anywhere in the industry at a global level.
The company alos offers great employment benefits across the board.",The competitive nature of the internal work environment can sometimes lead to a less than satisfactory work-life balance.
Consulting hardware engineer,3.0,It was a high pressure environment in which I learned a lot and developed confidence as a Software Engineer.,"We were always fighting to survive and getting late salaries because the main company disliked us, viewed our innovation work as disruptive to their business and saw us more as competition than collaborators with future of the company in mind."
Customer experience executive,4.0,"Safaricom provides good transport and support services for its employees and provides adequate security for all employees.
Safaricom provides adequate training to its employees to enable them to dispatch their duties.",In the customer service department there is no room to explore your creative talent as there is a preset script of dealing with customer.
Manager,4.0,"-Working for Safaricom equips you for any job environment. The key words are ""dynamic"" and ""pressure"". 
-There's no option but to keep up. Good results are always recognised and rewarded.
-Safaricom totally embraces innovation on all fronts. 
-Process improvement a core part of service delivery.
