Great products
Stability",Average pay compared to competitors
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jan 28, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade""."
Product manager 2,2.0,"Aug 6, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","A decent salary and benefits, all things considered","The expectation to grow products exponentially, but bureaucracy and lack of autonomy hamper your ability to actually execute on any sort of ambitious vision."
Product manager,4.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","* I constantly felt like there was a steady flow of very talented people, Not only are people brilliant but also open to mutual growth and learning.
* Exceptional cultural patience, especially within the New England management team, where time and space were generously given for individuals to grow and integrate.
* The company’s scale and appetite for calculated risk created abundant opportunities, which I was empowered to pursue and make the most of really making for an awesome career.
* Microsoft has a remarkable ability to hire genuinely kind and caring individuals. I deeply valued and admired the ICs I worked alongside.","* Senior leadership(CVP level) often impedes progress with decisions that feel disconnected from the realities of product development and customer needs. CVPs and above are disjoint from building and customer feedback process and are difficult and even resistant to involve or inform. This can lead to erratic decision-making canceling projects then months later restarting them as competitors did it, people working on the same thing but in nuanced different ways.
* CVPs really are neglecting areas where the Microsoft brand is strong, in favor of ""red ocean"" areas where Microsoft could succeed but would face tremendous friction.
* Microsoft is moving to a culture of layoffs where they are not based on performance or any meaningful metric often eliminating people who are incredibly talented devoted and loyal over people who really are stagnant.
* PM leadership continuously fails to define a strategy in any meaningful way to help organize IC teams."
Senior data center technician,4.0,"Aug 10, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, leaves a bit to be desired when compared to other big tech, but in general quite solid. Culture is generally great, benefits are fantastic. Lots of opportunities for growth. Having Microsoft on your resume is obviously a huge plus. Tons of opportunity to work with some incredibly smart, talented people. Management will fight for you on your behalf if you have the right skills and mindset.","Big shift lately towards an Amazon-like performance culture and less trust placed in employees. Lots of bureaucracy that makes it difficult to truly innovate. Pay is not good enough IMO for the second largest company in the world (market cap). Lots of values that are thrown out and sound really good, but in practice -- especially as you move up -- are essentially thrown out the window. Feels like MSFT bought too many GPUs without figuring out how to make it actually profitable, and the employees are paying the price."
Customer success account manager,3.0,"Jul 28, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years",Great benefits.  People take great pride in the work they do.  Microsoft is always at the forefront of technology and innovation.,"The role is seen as at the bottom.  Other roles are promoted more frequently and if you haven’t forged good relationships with those you work with, you’ll find their feedback can severely tarnish your year end review.  You can really learn a lot in this role but it can be difficult to have a career doing this. While there are some that have done so, it’s advisable to leverage the learning opportunities to move into other roles as quickly as you can.  This is also one of the only roles that have you on call 24/7.  They’ll tell you that you don’t have to answer the phone at 1am but if something goes awry and you don’t answer, you own the accountability."
Senior data analyst,1.0,"Aug 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years","Great benefits, great people, great place to learn",They will lay you off in a heartbeat if it makes any level of sense to them. There is no loyalty to employees. I have seen 20+ layoffs with the company in 23 years. I have been laid off twice by them. Be grateful for every day and always keep your resume current and have another plan.
Sr product marketing manager,2.0,"Jul 23, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","Great benefits, amazing people and the chance to work on some of the best products in the industry.","After having my most successful year at Microsoft (Excellent Connect Review, Bonuses and Raises) I was laid off after 15 years with the company. Why? Age (I am over 55), Years in role, (I was having huge impact but, I had not changed roles in over 5 years because I loved what I did and was having impact doing it) and Salary (I was at the top end of the salary). I am glad I left now that meeting 100% of your Connect objectives is now seen as only reaching 80% of them, This means MSFT can hire two people with minimal experience and have them work 60-70 hrs a week for the same cost as me that will be happy to change roles every three years. In short, they drew a line, if you were over the line with age, salary, or years in role, you were gone."
Csam - customer success account manager,3.0,"May 31, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","You might work for one of the most powerful tech companies on Earth, but your clients just want to know:

You're supposed to “drive adoption” of Microsoft tools... with clients who still pay invoices via fax. You’re constantly pushing for “modern collaboration,” while begging someone to accept a Teams meeting instead of sending a meeting invite from Lotus Notes

Partner development manager,4.0,"Jul 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","Most folks I met at Microsoft are great people. Because my team is great and my colleagues are dedicated to customer satisfaction, my job is enjoyable. Benefits are great. In the US, we have access to fantastic resources. Well respected company and gives you skills to thrive elsewhere.","The layoffs have been consistent over the past couple years and it has me in this constant zone of anxiety. I have to keep applying for roles externally just in case and that takes a lot of time. Career growth is very difficult at MS. You have layoffs and many talented people raising their hands for the same role. It’s easy to feel stuck in a job here. It’s all about exposure, your network and the stretch assignments you do outside of your role, to get you known. It can feel exhausting that doing your job isn’t enough. MS doesn’t see the great employees and offer to promote you into a new role, it’s all in your hands. Pay isn’t as good as other tech firms."

- Good benefits","- Leadership makes decisions that are either baffling ignorant or outright malicious (example: investing billions into developing a new campus in India, but also having several waves of layoffs due to insufficient funding)
- HR tends to be intensely passive aggressive when it comes to dealing with issues. They also can be straight up dismissive and uncaring. In my particular case, I had to move to a new state for personal reasons, so I had to notify them when I signed a new lease for my new place so they could notify me of my newly adjusted salary. Instead of the 10 - 15% reduction at worst they promised, they reduced my salary by 18%. Left several HR tickets over the situation and was promptly ignored. Left a bad taste in my mouth."
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Aug 9, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years",I liked the inclusive and supportive environment.

Always something new to learn.",Raises/Promotions are hard to come by if you're not visible enough to management. Culture is dependent on which campus you're at. Technically gifted individuals are often overlooked and neglected. Lack of technical roles in the data center. General career paths are management and project management.

Business program manager,3.0,"May 7, 2025",Former employee,"The benefits were incredible. Microsoft covered premiums for medical/dental/vision. They gave thousands in an HSA card. They matched 50% of 401k contributions up to the IRS limits. All told, probably 30k worth of benefits. 
The work was interesting, at least at first. 
Not too much micromanaging.
Excellent severance package.","No job stability. Seemingly at random, groups would get laid off. Might be 10 people this week from a neighboring department. Might be 2000 people next week. My group lasted pretty long, all things considered. Doesn't matter how well your team does, how many projects you complete, your team may be laid off with no warning.
I'm marking DEI as 1 star not due to any personal bad experiences, but rather because they laid off the entire DEI team, so I anticipate things getting worse.
More and more of the work is focused on the AI projects, even when the results of those projects are less than impressive."

Customer success account manager,4.0,"Jul 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","The organization offers a great deal of autonomy, and you're surrounded by colleagues who are genuinely willing to support you. Additionally, the benefits provided are among the most competitive I’ve seen in any U.S.-based career.","Over the past few years, the frequency and handling of organizational changes have raised significant concerns. These changes often appear abrupt and poorly managed, leading to a sense of instability across teams. There is a growing perception that senior leadership may lack a clear understanding of the day-to-day responsibilities of the roles beneath them—or, perhaps more concerning, that this understanding is not prioritized.
This shift has contributed to a culture where employees feel increasingly expendable. What was once a values-driven and people-focused environment now seems to be primarily centered on financial outcomes. Even in times of strong performance, job security feels uncertain, which undermines morale and trust."
Software engineer,1.0,"May 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years",Pay is fine I guess,"Lack of career options, no internal movement options without going through full dehumanizing interview screening again, posts record profit quarter and celebrates by laying off thousands of employees, every mandate and priority only matters if it cuts costs. Gone is any impetus for creating innovative experiences, quality products, and environments that care about people. AI to cut costs and reduce headcounts and eliminate orgs, they don't hire the brightest nor best people, there's no accountability or consequences for LT and execs, they get away with terrible decisions that sink orgs and cost the company billions by scapegoating the teams under them so they get a bigger bonus by closing studios and firing entire teams that only did what those execs directed them to do. They force you to be on-call 24/7 for long periods of time with no support, bridge calls with thousands of random people around the world for hours and hours on end, sleepless nights with your phone ringing off the hook because they're not interested in improving anything, just maintaining status quo and making it cheaper. We stopped fixing anything more than a year ago and just piled on more half-baked ""features"" that makes the business ""happy"" while making every user experience worse, buggier, slower, frustrating and aimless."

- Very deep hierarchies with many middle managers, lots of office politics, reorgs, etc.
- Always a big layoff around the corner
- Even if your manager is good, sometimes company-wide initiatives will hurt you. I lost my job due by an automated process that my manager wasn't even involved in.
- Anti-DEI at this point. Got rid of their whole DEI department, and then fired me and a lot of other trans and disabled people two days after the inauguration this year."

Senior software engineer,1.0,"Jul 25, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","* Flexible working time with fully remote option
* Compensation is so-so, Microsoft actually pays the least of the big tech companies (at least as of 2025), if you can get in at another big tech company rather do that since you'd be dealing with a lot of nonsense in any big tech company for the salary you're being paid, make every dollar count.
* Stock compensation can be good as long as the stock price are going up, but it serves as ""golden handcuffs"". If the stock price of Microsoft for whatever reason does not do well it is not worth working here.","* Mountains of red tape, stale documentation and bureaucracy that makes working here as an engineer dreadful experience. There can be days that you spend most of the day just navigating the bureaucracy that has nothing to do with actual engineering.
* There's this concept of ""One Microsoft"" that tries to foster cohesion across teams; this is failing miserably as people are being laid off and teams are increasingly facing higher pressure to deliver on commitments leading to unnecessary push back across team boundaries.
* Your direct manager (and skip level manager) is going to make or break you at this company. If your direct manager is not informed on the engineering side of things or cannot give much guidance regarding engineering processes as a senior/principal engineer, you'd have to pick up the slack for them and potentially do their job. Avoid new (less then 5 years at the company) managers, especially managers that do not learn on the engineering side of things. Try to get into a team with a strong engineering manager that knows what's going on, this will set you up for success. If you end up under a manager that do not know what they're doing (to determine this ask them technical questions and see whether they have at least some level of informed answer) aim to move to another team sooner than later.
* Tied to the previous point, your direct manager can see when you apply for other positions in the company, know that this has the potential to sour the relationship with your manager which can impact your career opportunities at the company.
* Engineers that stay at the company for a long time has to essentially work themselves into positions that are isolated from all the bureaucracy, red tape and potential cross team dependencies (think positions like code modernization that does not have a lot of cross team dependencies besides getting PR approvals)."

There is no path for growth and a lack of vision. The “values” are performative and they use growth mindset as a crutch to continue to cause disruption rather than making strategic decisions. Overall it’s a very “meetings about nothing” culture, everything gets offloaded to vendors and partners so you’re mainly babysitting rather than participating in meaningful work. Microsoft may be printing money, but the amount of waste is unbelievable. And when I talk about waste, it’s not the people, it’s the vendor relationships and frequent pivots.

Having Microsoft on your résumé can open doors to future opportunities, even at higher rates.

As a contractor, you probably won’t receive health insurance, paid vacation, or stock options—those are reserved for full-time employees.

2. Inconsistent hours:
Contract work may not guarantee 40 hours/week consistently, which affects total take-home pay.

3. No paid holidays or sick days:
Unless negotiated, days off are usually unpaid.

4. Limited internal influence:
Contractors may have less say in strategic direction or access to internal resources and systems.

5. Taxes & admin overhead:
You’re likely considered self-employed, so you’ll need to set aside taxes, manage invoicing, and potentially deal with HST if you're in Canada."

Content strategist,3.0,"May 19, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","Generous attention to health and well-being (could be lip service, of course); great food on campus; surface-level promotion of diversity and inclusion (my experience could have been an outlier, being one of two people on my team who didn't belong to the same ethnic group, with the only other employee of a different background having left the team between the time I trained them and my return from parental leave)","Preface - Received my first LITE (MS PIP) after over three years with the company, two weeks before the May 2025 layoffs

-The low performance claim was based mainly on brand new tasks, involving only three weeks of training for tasks on platforms with which I had no familiarity. Furthermore, despite receiving instruction to not include future ongoing/new tasks for this Connects (performance review) season, and training having only begun three weeks before the Connects call took place, these tasks occupied a significant portion of my performance evaluation for this Connects. One of these tasks centered around a tool that I verified via screenshare with the co-worker training me that it was providing incorrect numbers despite correct inputs, something I immediately remedied upon some lengthy troubleshooting but could not have known prior. I was also cited for not updating tags on a handful of content, when I had originally only been instructed to update the tag for one article. I then immediately remedied this once learning the additional tags were necessary, but not before the co-worker who trained me copied our manager on an email laying out these issues rather than addressing me about them first.

-Retroactive reasons given for low performance, counter to evidence: Another reason given for the LITE was allegedly not creating a user feedback synthesis with which I was tasked to create alone – even though I had created it alone, only for management to instruct another co-worker to create a second synthesis to which the whole team would contribute. When I asked, I was given no reason why they were not using my version, nor informed that this had been formally updated into a team effort (which evidently come this Connects season, it had been reverted to only my task again). Notwithstanding, I still contributed most of the content to the synthesis and organized a prototype design to propose a product feature based on the synthesized customer feedback.

-Retroactive reasons for low performance #2: It was claimed that I was taken off of a reports-based role due to “repeated glaring issues”, yet at the time, this was not given as the reason. At the time, I was juggling most of the reports for the team due to time zone, and those who took over from me have experienced similar occasional complaints from our partner team, suggesting issues that had arisen under my watch over an extended period just appeared to be repeated/numerous, as I was carrying most of that effort. Most of these issues involved technical trouble with our content management system which were debilitating enough that we had to migrate platforms, with the others mainly being our partners not wanting our team to conduct such meticulous reviews (despite this having been the review style on which I and others who joined around the same time were trained and having been docked once for allegedly not reviewing one report closely enough upon return from parental leave, I committed even more strongly to thoroughness). Instead, I was told at the time that I was taken off reports, because they needed someone full-time for another initiative. For the past year, I have received wonderful feedback on metrics goals I have achieved with this program. However, after being the only one on the team to not receive a raise or promotion despite only positive Connects/bonuses over three years at the company and seven years of previous industry experience, during our previous Connects season in December 2024, I asked what I could do to improve and was told that I needed more visibility and given a rundown of the role/band's subjective expectation categories - all of which I was able to speak to. To improve impact, I joined another initiative to enhance my existing initiative. The positive feedback received from three different Perspectives (peer reviews) regarding innovation for driving customer success and revenue were ignored and for the most part, this customer success and visibility initiative was discouraged by direct management. 

-Perspectives potentially influenced by management: A co-worker who is a senior on my team but who has never managed or trained me before the past three weeks working on one of these new tasks framed their feedback as if they were my manager, summing up my entire career at Microsoft and claiming I should be much further than I was, despite never having worked with me directly or overseen my tasks prior to the past month. They referenced a tool we have never used in our work together (but that another co-worker in their time zone has which suggests collaboration in writing this critique but was already covered by the other co-worker in their Perspective) and deliverable types we never worked on together. Furthermore, I was called out for “recurring” issues which were actually all unique from each other and stemming from lack of prior awareness (such as being told that required information was in the training video when it wasn’t, and that I made an inconvenient oversight in an email when it turned out the email in question was actually in an entirely different thread sent earlier on). By and large, while mitigating these hiccups are my responsibility and I am always ready to do so, some could not have been avoided until other factors came to light, so they seem to have been used as a paper trail to reflect negligence.

I had suspected that collaboration might have been occurring behind the scenes when the Connect Tool during last Connects season informed me that management had requested me to ask for a Perspective from a teammate with whom I hadn’t worked in two years but who was a principal member of the team, despite my having already requested Perspectives from five different folks. I was ultimately thankful for this peer’s feedback, as it was overall quite constructive and said that I took feedback very well, which countered what my manager’s comments have claimed - even if the feedback was regarding a task on which I no longer worked (hence us not having collaborated for two years). This could have been at the time due to the situation not being as dire as initially expected last Connects season, despite the performance-based layoffs already kicking off at the time. Once again, it would have been more lucrative to just explain that the report reviewing style (the only capacity in which we worked together) had changed rather than sequester me to a narrow role that has evidently minimal visibility.

While I understand that Microsoft is in a tough spot with these performance-driven and RIF layoffs, I wanted to craft this response, following a Connects call that was very rushed and had such poor audio quality from the manager’s side that I had to rely more on reading the comments than conversing and was not able to pose any questions before they had to end the call. I wanted to summarily assure that, despite my layoff, our team goals and my career at Microsoft have meant so much to me, and that, despite taking parental leave, I have remained ever-committed."
Senior software engineer,3.0,"Jun 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","good values in theory, good work life balance (not including on call), good benefits","work is boring, DRI shifts are hell, compensation is below industry average, no comradery/collaboration on team. forcing continued growth every year at the same level is psychologically harmful. it makes you feel like you are never good enough, and the company is just trying to squeeze more out of you all the time."

Discretionary time off was one of the worst things to happen to this company.","Your growth in a job often depends on your team and your relationship with your manager.

Unfortunately, I had a hard time with a manager who wasn’t respectful. They used Discretionary Time Off (DTO) unfairly against me. For example, after I worked an on-call shift, my boss told me I couldn’t take the compensatory day off like others because I had recently taken my birthday off.

It was also hard to get time off approved. Last year, I only managed to take about 10 days off—my birthday and a five-day trip I had planned. I wasn’t even able to take time off for Christmas.

There were times when my manager made me feel embarrassed in front of my team, even though they would later say they “had my back.” When I tried to share feedback, it was brushed aside, and they would talk about their own personal struggles instead. Despite getting poor ratings as a manager, they didn’t seem to make changes to improve.

That said, this experience was only with one manager. My other managers before this were supportive and professional."

However, recently, they've changed how vacations work by leaving it to manager's discretion which has absolutely destroyed the work life balance. Managers will ask for you to plan your vacations 6 months to a year in advance. They'll guilt trip you into not taking a vacation or taking a shorter vacation. They'll tell you how hard they work to discourage you from taking time off.

There are so many stories that both I and other people in my team and org have about these types of manipulation tactics from managers.

The management team is exceptional—highly technical and deeply understanding of the engineering experience within the organization.
The projects here operate at an extraordinary scale—arguably among the largest in the world, easily within the top three by size.
The work involves tackling unprecedented challenges in networking across a diverse range of sub-domains.
There's the opportunity to contribute, albeit somewhat indirectly, to groundbreaking technology initiatives.
Work-life balance is strong; while the team is hardworking and highly skilled, the workload is managed within humane hours.
Competence across the team is notably high. While the organization may not always have a top-tier reputation overall, the level of expertise within the Azure Networking group stands out as exceptionally strong, surpassing much of the broader organization.

For those who are queer or part of other marginalized groups, the environment is inclusive and respectful. It’s a remarkable place to focus on meaningful work without fear of harassment, bullying, or being overlooked—unfortunately, still a rare quality in many workplaces.","Compensation tends to be lower compared to other major tech companies.

Team leader,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Had an awesome team, deeply dedicated to their domain of expertise. Loved the work I did with them. 

The pay and benefits were really good comparatively to other companies.

Did I say how awesome the ICs and my team was.... great, kind, humble (most of them anyway)","My new boss was toxic: I was screamed at, humiliated, and gaslit for; 6 months. I dropped 30 pounds from the stress and was throwing up every morning when my boss called threatening my career and livelihood. I was a high performer under my prior boss, the only difference now - the CVP above me that I reported to. They were a terror.

CVP purposefully set out to destroy our team. Cut our team resources to nothing and then demanded we hit the same KPIs/ ""Do more with less"". CVP withheld critical information to make the team look less effective than other parts of their business. Very nasty/intentional -- played a game of favoritism and game of thrones. Very political. 

HR is often weaponized by underperformers - those people then abuse managers through blind survey or filing illegitimate complaints.. No one ever held accountable for filing BS claims - can say nasty things about you and degrade you; while their lawyers try to extort the company for money. Ugly game. HR does nothing to protect front line manager. HR irrelevant and not helpful, only objectives - protect the company and $ -- use a corrupt process. 

Became concerned for my safety and my family's safety as one employee that was mentally unhealthy threatened me personally. 

The most toxic environment imaginable."

While expectations are high, the environment is not overly stressful, and there's a strong focus on productivity rather than just hours worked.","While Microsoft offers many benefits, there are some drawbacks to consider. Being a large corporation, bureaucracy can sometimes slow down decision-making and innovation, especially compared to smaller, more agile companies. Team experiences can vary significantly, and some teams may have higher workloads or on-call rotations that impact work-life balance. Promotions can be competitive, requiring strong visibility and alignment with leadership goals. Additionally, while the company embraces hybrid work, some teams and projects may have more rigid expectations around in-office presence. Lastly, like any big tech company, navigating internal politics can be necessary for career advancement."

Architect,2.0,"Mar 24, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years",It’s structured and lean to complete.,"Every year there are commitments that do not always align with the specifics of the geography or area hence not achievable no matter how hard you work. The core commitments are defined at the headquarters and cascaded down to each management layer across the organization where additional objectives are added to the core commitment to meet each managements own objectives, In the end review commitments are a bunch of metrics that either impacts negatively the customer or the technology/service. Example, product/service software developers are evaluated by the number broken code issues before releasing a product/service. A common practice is to avoid raising awareness or fix any malfunctioning code until the product/service is released. This practice reduces the chances of a malfunctioning code harming developers evaluation and hence their bonus, that’s why after a release of products, service or technology the fixes patches etc. are always high. Seems like any product, service or technology isn’t ready to be released but the bonus is fulfilled due to the way the developers are evaluated. It’s vicious. If you raise concerns about this, you may end up fired. Remember, Microsoft's business culture and values are more important than employees' personal cultures and values. 
Finally, at Microsoft nowadays, if you are not originally or descended from India, your chances to grow your career there are lower in comparison to Indians."

Swag (rare)",Growth mindset is a lie they try to say. Had a bad review over a year ago and had a followup review 6 months after that and it was positive stating that I addressed everything. I was a high performer on the team and 6 months later (a year after the bad review) I was terminated for performance. My manager had said 2 weeks prior to that I'm on track for a promotion for the year. So I think the higherups did some query to terminate people with LITEs (bad review) within a 3 year range. Growth mindset is a lie. Didn't even get severance when I was doing really well in my role.

Benefits are premium. Best 401k match on the planet. Health benefit of $3,000 to spend on bikes, hiking and fitness gear etc. Beer kegs exist in most project rooms. And there’s no need to advance your skills beyond what you learned in college. They run their hardware orgs like college design projects not like commercial product development companies.","Because top pay and frequent failure go hand in hand, the orgs are political. Many directors, general managers and some of the VPs are more motivated to protect their status and compensation instead of trying to improve the organization. And so the hardware groups fail and lose money. 

The worst is the politics that arise due to leaders protecting themselves. And folks deep down know they are less deserving of accolades and higher pay and bonuses than their peers in other industries. So while they post how amazing hogging out space for a motherboard on an aluminum brick is, they avoid mirrors that will reveal the truth. They are locusts.

And finally, internally it was admitted that the company wants to get rid of all white men over 45. As a hiring manager
I took a class in which the instructor stated that. And recruiters also told me that they were not allowed to present resumes to me of anyone over 50."

Reviews only happen twice a year. I worked there for 2.5 years with ""no budget for raises or promotions"". One or two people in the entire org got promoted once a year. After my first year, there was an internal hiring freeze that kept anyone from even changing teams.

Shortly after my fourth glowing performance review, I was part of the 10k people laid off in spring 2023. Though the announcement was made in January, the layoffs were rolling for months. I was a part of the very last ones, laid off in a group of 12 people by my 5th level skip, to make room for more people to work on their terrible AI. 

Disorganized chaos:

Agile/scrum is industry standard but it still hasn't caught on at Microsoft. If you need structure, clear requirements, etc., make sure that's something the team you're going to join cares about. My org only started doing *quarterly* planning for engineering in late 2022.

I'm back as a contractor now in a different org and it's actually even worse. They don't even do quarterly planning.

Every organization and team have different cultures around planning, expectations, documentation, etc. If you're thinking about joining make sure to talk to your individual manager about it."

The team culture is very supportive, and I’ve had many positive experiences working across departments to solve complex issues. There are great opportunities for career development, and the leadership training has really helped me grow in my role. Work-life balance is also respected, with flexible work hours that help me manage my personal time effectively.","One downside I’ve experienced is the heavy workload, especially when managing high-priority projects. The pace can become overwhelming, particularly when resources are stretched thin. Communication between departments could be improved, as there are times when it feels like information is siloed, slowing down project progress. Some processes can feel unnecessarily bureaucratic, making it difficult to push through decisions quickly. Lastly, the performance expectations can create pressure, especially during project launches, which can make the role feel a bit stressful at times."

Principal software engineer,4.0,"Aug 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 8 years","Working at this company has its share of positives. The work itself is engaging and meaningful, providing a good balance of challenges and learning opportunities. The facilities are top-notch, offering a comfortable and well-equipped environment that makes the daily grind much easier. Perhaps one of the biggest advantages is the freedom to make decisions. Employees are given a lot of autonomy in their roles, which fosters creativity and innovation. This level of trust is rare and makes you feel genuinely valued as part of the team.","However, the company is not without its downsides. The on-call rotations can be extremely frustrating, often feeling like a burden rather than a necessary duty. What's more concerning is that management seems indifferent to this issue, leaving employees to handle the stress on their own. Another major drawback is that many talented individuals are stuck supporting legacy products that seem to be on the brink of collapse. This not only wastes potential but also creates uncertainty about the future. Personal growth is another area where the company falls short. Despite the hard work and contributions, salary hikes are questionable, making it difficult to feel motivated in the long run."

They emphasize a growth mindset and try to care about people. They have strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion which helps everyone think about how to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment. The pay and benefits are competitive. Because of all the products they work on, you can work on different products and move teams without leaving the company. They’re also making a lot of great strategic decisions which gives me faith in the leadership and direction they’re headed.","While the company culture overall is good and they try to emphasize good values, it’s a huge company so you can have a vast difference in experience depending on where you work. If you’re interviewing, make sure you meet with your hiring manager, evaluate them and ask questions about the culture of the team. 
A lot of work is still Seattle centric which makes it difficult to be visible if you’re new and remote, impacting promotions, influence, etc.
If you’re getting hired for a PM position, make sure you understand what is expected from the role. It looks vastly different depending on the product and its needs. I would recommend staying away from products that aren’t growing, especially as a PM."

Competitive Environment: The culture can be highly competitive, with a strong focus on performance and results. This environment can foster growth but may also create stress and a sense of constant competition among peers.

Limited Influence on Strategic Decisions: Depending on the level of the PM role, you might have limited influence on high-level strategic decisions, as these are often made by senior executives. This can sometimes make it challenging to drive certain initiatives forward.

Frequent Changes in Priorities: Due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry, priorities can shift quickly, requiring PMs to be highly adaptable. This can sometimes lead to frustration if you prefer a more stable and predictable work environment."

In almost every team I was part of you are expected to somewhat bow down to people at higher SDE levels than you, even if they have less experience, are making wrong decisions, or are being abusive.

Unfortunately, Microsoft is known for this culture. Satya Nadella, the current CEO, has made huge improvements with this.

First, it was do more with less, because Microsoft has been laying off people right and left — many of them totally unnecessarily. The work still needs to be done, but they just cut the teams doing it. My team was cut by 60% even though there is more work than before. Then, it was do more with less compensation, when Microsoft decided not to give raises to full-time employees (during high inflation, let's call this what it is: a pay cut). The, it was do more with less as Microsoft is reducing its budget for morale, equipment, travel, vendors, everything really. WLB has gotten worse. Compensation has gotten worse. Culture has gotten worse. Morale is the lowest I've seen in over a decade. And leadership appears not to care; worse, even to be daring people to complain, daring them to leave.

If you hitch your wagon to a product that fails, you may find yourself on the layoff line despite personal performance. There is little to no effort to retain employees swept up in these broad reorganizations; each employee has to reapply to a new role on their own which often happens during a period of hiring freezes and uncertainty across the company."

Senior management is clearly politically motivated and practices lip service when it comes to work/life balance and desire for diversity and inclusion. If you are of a particular category (in the US), you’re clearly being weeded out to help the company improve it’s look in the industry. Companies they buy are to either stifle competition, or to extend their beholden approach to anything. Then they rip the company apart very quickly thereafter.

Software engineer,3.0,"Jun 9, 2024","Former employee, more than 5 years","You're around very smart engineers from global teams working together. There are a lot of genuinely hardworking, cooperative, kind engineers that make everyday work so much smoother and easier. Good perks and generally calm atmosphere outside of your team (people are usually nice). Pay is decent, less than other big tech companies obviously, but you get a better work-life balance as a trade. Honestly, you're only here for the pay, the generally ok work-life balance compared to industry, and those good teammates who you will treasure.","A lot of older guard workers are resistant to improving the engineering process. PMs dominate the show at the cost of SDEs - you will be pushed to deliver buggy releases to angry customers, prioritize features over bug fixes, and then marked down for spending so much time on-call fixing the problems PMs pushed you to ship. There is no extra compensation or time-off for on-call, just pressure. 

Build and deployment processes are slapdash and flaky - expect to wait multiple hours for a build and deployment only for a transient failure to require you to stay late and retry (and expect those failures multiple times per month). Build and deployment process filled with poorly maintained and poorly documented shell scripts. 

Culture of rushed delivery and constant hotfixes, even worse if you're on a service team like Azure. You will not get extra compensation for all of this pressure, and the teams will stay understaffed. 

There are a lot of ""bad apples"" distributed all over in high positions. Female employees might feel uncomfortable speaking up about their managers leering at their body (as I have), and if spoken up about, little is done for years. Covert racism if you're not white. 

I was in a team under C+AI and we kept losing people and couldn't retain anyone - despite being a crucial and visible part of the ecosystem. Why did people want to leave, and why did people keep getting burned out? We kept losing mostly senior engineers and keeping junior ones, and mostly losing women too. Even if it's not deliberate, you should ask why attrition and poor retention affected those groups the most."

My position was eventually eliminated and I was laid off, but was given 3 months of severance pay and felt that Microsoft handled the process with dignity. Obviously nobody wants to get that call, but it ended up being a good catalyst for my career and having the 3 months of full salary/benefits to take a break and job search was really nice.","As with other large corporations there's a lot of bureaucracy and rigid process.

Micromanagement and unrealistic or unstated expectations were the norm and the environment was fully abusive and toxic. I don't attribute this to Microsoft but specifically to my manager.

Depends on the team, but usually people are nice, helpful and easy to network with. This is especially true across other teams, as everyone maintains a customer-first mindset.","Like I said, depends on the team. In a top down approach, the core values at the top aren't always mirrored the lower you go. People are people and sacrifice these values for deadlines and metrics. Promotions aren't always merit based and there's an affinity for hiring people from outside who do not reflect company core values into management roles that they have no experience in. Also, while there are a lot of resources available, finding out about them is sometimes the hard part. I worked here for years without understanding how ESPP and 401k worked, how to go through the process of taking certifications (for free), and other perks that are available to all employees.

People who have been there for a long time call themselves ""Softees"". The top corporate leadership went to similar ivy league schools and have been there for more than 15 years, so they protect each other. It's very tough being a new manager to offer a different opinion, it's frowned on. They say they want people of diverse backgrounds to participate in introducing new ideas, but it's mostly lip service, since direct bosses will discourage it. Some bosses are frankly afraid, since they don't know anything else besides the ""Softee"" way. Microsoft works in a matrix leadership instead of a pyramid, which is unproductive and very political, since you most likely will not just have one boss, but a ""skip"" boss too that will compete to manage you.

Again, appearances are all this group has going for them. A lot of smiles and small talk but if you show any sign of being a decent person or a true leader, they will try to mentally destroy you.","There was a LOT of intentional deletion/misunderstanding/manipulation of others work product. 

Most of middle management only promotes people who are the same ethnicity as them. 

There was a lot of bullying and racist comments in performance reviews. Racist comments were backed up by Staff. They see no problem with calling Black and Brown people “aggressive” and telling them TO THEIR FACE that they are intellectually inferior. 

Most of the people in this group have ONLY worked in Audit. Their interpersonal skills are limited and they lack creativity to go beyond what’s told to them.

You have to receive a performance review after EVERY 4-week audit. I once took time off due to my dog dying (I took 1 day off) and this was included in my performance review as a “do-better”. 

The group has high turnover (go figure) because upper management talks to people like they’re dirt.

Their “diversity” initiatives are all bull; If you’re not outside friends with upper management you will not be promoted or given the opportunity to travel. 

They will encourage working you like a dog for their 4-week audits that are poorly planned for time/scope, even though upper management is so “skilled” at their jobs they can never budget the right amount of time or resources for an audit.

Most of the group is comprised of “ex-consultants” and this again leads to a negative environment. These people tout lives that would make you think they can extend common decency and some sort of empathy, but you’ll be left talking to empty vessels that are insecure if a thought of yours is someone better than theirs. A very insecure and fake group.

On multiple occasions I saw stakeholders curse at and belittle staff. The thought is that if stakeholders treat you bad that is YOUR PROBLEM and you clearly must have done something wrong. Abuse is encouraged in this group.

I was personally told that my degrees and certificates “don’t matter” by my manager at the time. If that was the case, I’m not sure why they hired me. Statements like this were often made in 1:1s with my “manager” who has been at the company 10+ years, yet never managed people. Make it make sense….. How is one promoted to upper management yet has NEVER managed people. That makes NO SENSE whatsoever. The team does not logically assess if a person is truly fit to lead. 

Theres no training requirement on Project Management so there’s people overseeing this who don’t have the right background. If you bring up Project Management practices they will deflect and state some CPA jargon. This is probably why the genius “4-week” audit idea continually fails and why their scope/budgeting/testing/etc. is always a mess.

Asked to work on weekends (especially for financial audits that are poorly planned) and they don’t pay you for the extra time.

This is currently not a 9-5 job (for the people that aren’t close friends with upper management). This is a 7-8 job and the pay does not reflect that. 

Mentioned above, none of the staff has any background credentials in what they’re doing. Most of the staff has a “CPA” and that’s apparently all you need to understand AI, Project Management, Testing, etc. (*Sarcasm*)."

Work-Life Balance: Despite being a large corporation, Microsoft places a significant emphasis on work-life balance. Flexible working hours and the possibility of remote work are policies that support employees in managing their professional and personal lives.
Career Growth and Mobility: Employees at Microsoft have numerous opportunities for career advancement within the company. The organization's vast array of products and services allows for lateral moves and upward mobility in various departments and global locations.","Work Pressure and Deadlines: Working on innovative and high-impact projects often comes with tight deadlines and high expectations. This can sometimes result in work pressure and long hours to meet project goals.
Bureaucracy and Red Tape: As with any large corporation, navigating the company's bureaucracy and administrative processes can be challenging. Decision-making may be slower, and getting projects off the ground might require navigating through various levels of approvals.

Manager tries to push down provided estimates and add extra work during the sprint. There's no budget to bug fixes. As results nothing is done in time and all blames goes to engineers. I worked for small start up and I know what is real pressure when the future of the whole company depends on the release. So I know what is hard work and I get used to work overtime.

You literally cannot find all of the benefits, people have spreadsheets to keep up with their are so many. The culture though is amazing. If you ever want a day off, you just need to ask. Teams are willing to help you and bend over backwards in an emergency. I love the people","I hate the review process as it feels arbitrary and, in some cases, its like a research project. It is also very inconsistent. My first manager had a slide deck where you had to research and fill in the values. Second manager basically said she does it off the communication notes. There is also a huge disparity in people's skill level. You would think being MSFT you would be with the best of the best and people who really know the platform, sadly not really the case.

Critical environment technician,2.0,"Nov 18, 2022","Former employee, less than 1 year",Medical/Dental benefits cost zero out of pocket for family. Plenty of time off from day one. The benefits and time off is the only reason I gave 3 stars for “compensation/benefits”.,"Pay is substantially below market value, reasoning is because they offer a “whole compensation package”. They say you’ll be paid $X amount annually, but they include the cost of health insurance and other random benefits, so your in pocket pay is $20K-ish less than the amount you’ll actually receive. I don’t know about Microsoft as a whole, but at the location I was at, higher up management doesn’t care about you or your work. They only care about the numbers that get them their annual bonus. Like a responsible employee, I put in a 2 week notice. Was walked off site that day, told I’d be paid for the two weeks, only to find out from HR that they wouldn’t be paying anything. So lost 2 weeks of pay. Luckily new employer actually fairly compensates, so me and the family aren’t not completely screwed for half a month. Lastly, they love to say there is upward growth. However every quarter they “don’t have money in the budget” or “don’t have positions for anyone” but will always have open positions to hire new employees. On that note, I was not a “disgruntled former employee” until the situation with my two week notice. Everything prior to that is an honest opinion of the company/position."

Senior marketing manager,4.0,"Jul 21, 2023",Current employee,"Autonomy, budgets, remote work, opportunity to work internationally and have the ability to have multiple careers in one company. Great program for early in career","Becomes very difficult to move from level 64 (Sr. Manager) to level 65 (Director). Highly political with many layers of oversight to get anything done, needing to go three layers up to approve internal decks and internal emails. Politics can create a highly toxic environment. Leaders pander to one another rather than doing what is right for the customer. Group Manager roles are a promotion in responsibility only, you double your responsibility and working hours with no additional pay until you can reach level 65. No guarantees that you will reach level 65 after working 70 hour work weeks. Certain teams have very little work life balance with a ton of expectation creating a lot of stress in the workplace. Operations are not available to support employees needs in marketing - can take up to 8 months to launch a marketing campaign."

There was a time where I looked forward to waking up and going to work. I felt the work was challenging and rewarding. My contributions were acknowledged and I was learning from my peers and leaders. Over the past few years, however, I’ve seen a drastic change in culture. Priorities change frequently and result in poor work life balance. Mid and low level managers are focused on empire building and promote extremely toxic culture. On top of this, the company had layoffs and stretched it out over many months, keeping employees extremely stressed about job security. We were told to work extra hard during this time, as if to prove we had some worth, and rewarded for that effort with more layoffs and the announcement of no raises. All of this is happening during record high stock prices. It feels that management no longer values its talent and is just chewing and spitting out folks who have worked long and hard to contribute to the success of the company."

Unfortunately, my experience has been far from what I initially envisioned. The organization's leadership seems to lack the qualities of effective leaders. They not only micro-manage their teams but also create an environment that fosters toxicity and undermines employee morale. It's disheartening to witness the consistent favoritism and the tendency to gang up against certain team members. Such practices erode trust and hinder open communication, which are essential for any healthy work environment. It has become clear that the leadership's actions do not align with the values of fairness, respect, and professionalism that should be upheld. In conclusion, my time at Microsoft news and team has been marked by challenges stemming from leadership practices that hinder personal and professional growth. I hope that these concerns are addressed, and the organization can evolve into a more supportive and inclusive workplace in the future."

Principal product manager,4.0,"Apr 28, 2023","Former employee, more than 10 years","For better and worse, Microsoft is a big enterprise software company. While there's a handful of people working in consumer products (mostly in Xbox), for the most part the company is about enterprise software. And it is definitely a big company, and will often feel like one -- product teams are large, decision-making can sometimes be slow, and there are a lot of different angles to consider. But at the end of the day the company places people over process. There's very few processes that are actually mandated across the whole company, and few times the process can't be adjusted to fit local circumstances. Being a big company has other advantages -- it's a company your family has heard of with products they and hundreds of millions of others use. And because the company is so large, you can change jobs within the company and do some very different things. Microsoft's not grown as fast recently as some other companies like Facebook, which means somewhat older employees and more experienced managers. Medical coverage is very good.","As mentioned above, it's a big, enterprise-focused company. The products tend not to be sexy and major decisions take time to make."

Software engineer,5.0,"Jul 22, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year",Honestly the best corporate leadership culture out of any company I've ever worked for.

Benefits are good pay is good it's really hard to beat. But the healthy non toxic culture would make me stay even if i was offered significantly more money. It's that important. Also remote work. No amount of money would ever convince me to go back to an office and so far they 100% embrace remote for some positions so I'll likely be here for a very long time.,Haven't found any downside yet.

Many times they are hard to find or communicate with because they are either not in the office or theyre tucked away in unknown meetings. They'll use cool catchphrases like 'we're working towards a process that allows us to make decisions faster' but that meeting often lasts way too long. They roll out a new structure that everyone has to follow and it disrupts everyone. Rinse and repeat every quarter or so. It's pretty insane tbh.

Recent layoffs across the company shocked many ppl. .Azure orgs have a steep learning curve because the systems are complex . Oncall and incident driven work may not be for everyone .Azure is quite complex to ramp up. Depending on your manager and the level you get hired, you may be expected to understand the systems in unreasonable time. This gets worse when Senior employees do not help well with ramp up or don't have good documentation available . Azure has lots of diferent orgs. So all I am saying here is team dependent. I dont know how it is in other orgs or teams across Microsoft. The quicker you ramp up, the easier the job becomes, the better your confidence and WLB"

Web developer,5.0,"Aug 21, 2023","Current employee, less than 1 year","'ve had the incredible opportunity to work as a Web Developer at Microsoft, and let me tell you, it's been a journey filled with growth, innovation, and unparalleled experiences. Here's why I absolutely love being a part of the Microsoft web development team: Cutting-edge Technology: Microsoft is at the forefront of technological advancement, and as a web developer here, I've had the privilege of working with the latest tools, frameworks, and technologies. This constant exposure to cutting-edge innovations has not only enhanced my skillset but also kept me excited and motivated every day. Collaborative Environment: The work culture at Microsoft promotes collaboration and teamwork like no other. I've had the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry, and the brainstorming sessions, code reviews, and pair programming exercises have significantly improved the quality of my work. Continuous Learning: Microsoft places a strong emphasis on learning and growth. The company offers various learning resources, workshops, and conferences that have helped me stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving web development landscape. The continuous learning mindset here is truly inspiring. Impactful Projects: One of the most satisfying aspects of working as a web developer at Microsoft is the chance to work on projects that have a global impact. The products and services we create touch the lives of millions, and knowing that my code contributes to such impactful solutions gives me a sense of purpose. Diverse Perspectives: Microsoft is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. This diversity of thought and perspective has enriched my problem-solving abilities and has opened my eyes to new ways of approaching challenges. Work-Life Balance: Despite being a tech giant, Microsoft values work-life balance. The flexible working hours and remote work options have enabled me to maintain a healthy equilibrium between my professional and personal life.","Working as a Web Developer at Microsoft has been an enlightening journey, but like any experience, there are a few drawbacks to consider. While the positives are abundant, here are some cons that I've encountered during my time at the company: Bureaucracy and Size: Microsoft's vast size can sometimes lead to bureaucratic processes. Decision-making can be slower due to multiple layers of approval, which can be frustrating when you're eager to implement innovative solutions quickly. Fast-Paced Environment: While the fast-paced nature of the tech industry is exciting, it can also be demanding. Tight deadlines and ambitious project goals can sometimes lead to high-pressure situations, affecting work-life balance. Complexity of Projects: Given the company's focus on cutting-edge technology, projects can sometimes become quite complex. While this presents an excellent opportunity for growth, it can also be challenging and overwhelming, especially for junior developers."

Senior direct sales associate,3.0,"Jul 25, 2023","Current employee, more than 3 years","Microsoft offers very generous benefits. The cost of medical, dental, vision, legal, AD&D, and life insurance for a family of 3 was less than $80/month. Microsoft also offers 401K match, employee stock purchase program, tuition reimbursement, adoption reimbursement, and a fitness/health reimbursement. Pending your team and your manager, work/life balance and flexibility can fluctuate. In my case, we were ""required"" to be in the office one day/per week, but was not enforced. Other team leaders require you to badge into an office 1-3 times/week.","""Culture."" This is a hot-button word leadership and sr. leadership like to tote around, but the reality is the shareholders heavily influence the culture and future of the org. The 10,000+ layoffs this year (2023) no or very limited raises this year ""due to economic times"" came as both a shock and a disappointment, as the organization has had a record-breaking year (again) and is looking to spend $69,000,000,000 in CASH for Activision/Blizzard. It does not seem to add up. ""Diversity + Inclusion"" is another hot-button word Microsoft likes to use, but the company only cares about diversity of color, not diversity of thought. DEI here just checks a box and feels more like pandering than actually doing anything of substance. Benefits - while the benefits are excellent here, they vary greatly per role. The company likes to talk about being ""one Microsoft."" Still, there is a huge disparity of benefits and rewards between retail/hourly workers and corporate Microsoft, also referred to as ""greater"" Microsoft. Corporate employees get higher stock/bonuses/rewards, have 3x the amount allotted for fitness reimbursement, and have higher tuition reimbursement than hourly workers (data centers, stores, digital sales reps, etc.). I understand there may be different rewards for perceived differences in value/ROI, but don't pretend to be ""one Microsoft"" if all is not equal. Paid time off - Microsoft used to have accrued time off based on length of service. This meant you earned your time off. However, the org recently moved to ""unlimited discretionary time off (DTO)."" On paper, this is great; at the discretion of your manager, there is no longer a cap on the amount of time you can take off. It also looks great on paper to say ""unlimited time off."" The issue is that it is discretionary. Instead of telling your manager when you would like to take time off based on your earned PTO, you now have to ask permission.

It has the prestige and respect to open doors throughout your career, and enough departments to ensure you're constantly growing in your discipline. Company culture and values are solid--and there's a real effort to improve, even if pockets of the old company (a place that was aggressive, Type A, competitive, and gate keep-y) still exist. I'm proud of the work we do and don't feel like I'm contributing to a worse-off world. Their commitment to leading the hybrid work conversation means remote work and hybrid schedules are accepted as normal.","Compared to its competitors, Microsoft consistently offers lower pay, particularly for business disciplines. Expect to make less than you would at Google, Amazon, or Meta, and potentially be given a lowball offer.

They justified this by saying we have more stability and less WLB issues. Now we've laid off over 10,000 employees, we've been told by Satya to ""do more with less"", and we've had our bonuses eliminated despite hitting an all time stock high. Given the actions of our leadership, proceed with caution - Certain teams like Azure and Xbox have far worse work life balance than other teams. They can also be highly competitive, making a raise or promo difficult - Role expectations can be pretty rigid. Rather than management looking at your strengths, you are graded against a strict rubric. If you don't fit the mould, your career will suffer - Internal transfers are just as hard as external transfers, as you still have to do a full interview loop"

It isn't a bad thing necessarily just don't get lulled into that they ""care"" about you. They care about creating a great environment for you to do your best work so you can drive more impact at the company. They don't actually care about you as a person beyond what you can drive for them. This is a mirror reflection of the state of companies now.

Mobile app developer,4.0,"Jul 24, 2023",Former employee,"I recently had the privilege of working as an engineer at Microsoft, and I must say, it has been an extraordinary experience that exceeded all my expectations. From the very beginning, I was thoroughly impressed by the company's commitment to innovation, its supportive work culture, and the plethora of opportunities for professional growth. One of the standout aspects of my time at Microsoft was the cutting-edge technology and projects I had the chance to be a part of. The company's dedication to pushing the boundaries of innovation was evident in every project, and as an engineer, it was both inspiring and motivating to work with such visionary teams. The resources and tools provided were state-of-the-art, which allowed us to develop solutions that had a real impact on the world.","My time as an engineer at Microsoft was nothing short of disappointing and left me with an overall negative impression of the company. While it is undoubtedly a prestigious tech giant, my personal experience has been far from the ideal work environment I had hoped for. First and foremost, the work culture at Microsoft was incredibly toxic and cutthroat. Instead of fostering a collaborative atmosphere, there was a constant sense of competition among colleagues. This environment made it difficult to form meaningful working relationships and left me feeling isolated and unsupported. The excessive focus on meeting deadlines and achieving unrealistic targets often overshadowed the quality of work and employee well-being. Additionally, I was dismayed by the lack of recognition for hard work and dedication. Despite putting in long hours and going the extra mile to deliver results, I seldom received acknowledgment or appreciation from management. This lack of recognition left me feeling undervalued as an employee and significantly impacted my motivation. Furthermore, the technology and tools provided were outdated and cumbersome to work with. While Microsoft is known for its technological advancements, it was surprising to see that the engineering teams were often forced to work with subpar resources. This not only hindered our productivity but also made it challenging to keep up with competitors in the rapidly evolving tech industry."

The stock is not just lottery tickets unlike most startups. Some great benefits, such as the ability to put additional $33K (instant Roth conversion) into your 401K after topping off your max annual contribution ($22.5K) and Microsoft's match ($10K). Decent LWB. Decent perks. Okay insurance.","From what I hear, not all organizations within MS are the same. I, however, have only seen one. In my org, we have a codebase that is truly unpleasant to work with. It is bad in every imaginable way, from size, to readability, to performance, to architecture. What makes this worse is the fact that engineers are expected to do the work of product and project managers as well as DevOps. That's in addition to our own work. Theoretically we have product people, but I've never seen them do anything useful except maybe some really high-level stuff. Everything that a PM does in any other company, your team is expected to do. You will see a lot of people who've been at MS for decades. They've not seen much else, or have seen it so long ago that they have no understanding of the current state of tech. And because they've been here for so long, they have a lot of weight. That's why that codebase is such a disaster and why it will remain a disaster despite constant efforts and initiatives to improve it. No architect is ever gonna say ""I messed up, this is all bad, delete it"" or ""We decided to use tech X because it seemed cool, but we don't actually know how to use it, so we applied it in the same exact way as we know how to apply the old tech Y"". And despite tech X actually being awesome, the team produced a monstrosity because all they know is tech Y and reading a couple of tutorials didn't help. To be fair, there are a lot of smart people here, who care about code quality, but the higher a person gets in rank, the more they care about looking important and covering their own behind. The company itself is gigantic and therefore a bureaucratic nightmare with proportional amounts of Kool-Aid being distributed. After the layoffs we are expected to ""do more with less"" (as if that wasn't already the case) and we won't get a cost-of-living pay increase this year because of ""difficult economic situation and uncertainty"". That was announced a few weeks after a record-breaking profits announcement. There is also an eternal corporate song in the air, about supporting the latest trend. At the moment it's diversity, inclusion, equity, social justice, etc. Obviously, the company doesn't actually care, none of them do, but it has to project an appearance or be eaten alive on Twitter. So just smile and wave and you'll be fine. Overall, it's just another large corporation. You can have an amazing experience, or you can have a terrible experience. It all depends purely on the org/team that you end up in/on."

Growing disconnect between frontline employees and executives this year following poor management of mass layoffs, creating an atmosphere of mistrust. Aggressive cost-cutting measures being effected this year, perceived as needless, have impacted employee compensation and benefits, further straining the relationship with executive leadership."

This means that you can be without career evaluation for years. The issue is that the tooling (Connect) is used to apply internally so if like me your manager is simply uninvested, they render you non-competitive. My best option was to apply outside of Microsoft to reach seniority. The other issue is diversity. While I see the value everywhere. As a woman, it wasn't fun to be the only one in the room as I was the only woman in my team. I think Microsoft is overselling diversity to attract talent but there is no real plan after that especially for diverse candidates with manger who are not invested. Lastly HR was not helpful or supportive in addressing the issue besides dismissing my concerns and sending me back to my manager. And so was the leadership team."

You have to accept that you can only impact so many gears around you, and if you want to expand your network you have to make a concerted effort to do so. - There are always some people who make it through the cracks in hiring. Thankfully, I think that is less the case at MSFT, but still, it happens. I just wish we were more rigorous in some aspects of hiring, especially for non-technical roles."

It took me a year from my first interview with zero interim communication until a finals day. I accepted another job and worked someplace else for 10 months before the second round of interviews even began. Internal hiring is equally abysmal, with little to no opportunity for internal movement due to various quota requirements. M1's are literally unable to help you at all. They have no power except forwarding your complaints or concerns to someone who doesn't care to listen--by which time you are persona non grata for not toeing the company line. The work schedule can be grueling, especially if you support multiple timezones. You have to defend your time off and refuse to justify it. During every round of layoffs, you have no idea where you rank. As someone who has had multiple published works, shipping products, involved in community leadership, nominated multiple times for Gold and Platinum club (internal awards), speaking engagements on behalf of MS, highest possible evaluations in Connects (internal review process), and internal mentoring, not to mention years in sales exceeding quotas by 100% or more, I would have thought that I would be valued or given the opportunity to move to a new role. Your contributions aren't valued more than you most recent 1:1 with your manager. Don't spend your life laboring for an organization that does not recognize or reward for sacrifice or above-and-beyond work."

Global hr director,3.0,"Mar 13, 2023","Former employee, more than 5 years","As someone who worked in Global HR at Microsoft, I have seen the amount of travel that Microsoft employees do; so much of it is unnecessary. Microsoft invented Teams in part so that people don't need to travel by air for business so often. Microsoft already knows flights are terrible for the climate – that’s why it’s been offsetting its flights and investing in sustainable jet fuels. But offsets are deeply flawed and sustainable aviation fuels are so expensive that the airline industry has consistently failed to meet its own targets for sustainable fuel use over the decades. If Microsoft wants to be a real climate leader, it must scrap all but the most necessary flights from its travel policy.","There’s a reason Microsoft invented Teams to replace flights in the first place. Flying halfway around the world for a one-hour meeting is a huge waste of time and resources – nearly 1 in 3 business travelers find it difficult to stay on top of their workload when traveling. Polling in Europe has shown around 3 in 4 business workers think recent air travel restrictions had no effect or a positive effect on productivity. Frequent business travel has been linked to burnout – nearly a quarter of business travelers say they have to work more to make up for lost time while traveling. Business flights can especially lead to added stress for single parents, who have to find childcare for their kids. This is something Microsoft should be especially worried about given its own research recently found 41% of the global workforce is considering leaving their employer this year."

There is some respect from non-Microsoft colleagues for Microsoft employees.","Muddled, unaccountable, big middle management.   PFEs have an Account Manager as a person manager, and they work with TAMs and often other Project Managers, Architects, etc. in the course of their work.  I notice that Account Managers are often not only maladroit with respect to Microsoft technology, but technology in general.  And they often are really poor managers.  Microsoft has a 'connect' process that HR instituted to force managers and employees to talk several times a year.  Often, Account Managers view this as a checkbox, and it's symptomatic if their not putting much effort into managing people.   TAMs are supposed to be Technical Account Managers, but often they are neither technical nor managers.  You can't have a grown-up conversation with TAMs, often, because they don't understand the technology.  They are supposed to be bridge between the customer and the technical PFEs, but I have seen a lot of slacker TAMs who actually just make PFEs life more difficult.  And I've heard customers say that they want the good work that PFEs do, but they don't want to pay for the exorbitant associated costs of having to also pay for ADMs, TAMS, etc. etc. Career advancement within various fiefdoms is not based on technical merit or utilization or even how valuable you are to your customer, but based on 'go along to get along' mentality and kissing up to management."

Director,3.0,"Jan 24, 2012",Former employee,An international thinking company with lots of opportunity.  Pay is OK and benefits are great.  Company tries harder than most to treat staff well.,"Review process is competitive with your peers.  This means they gain if you lose and leads to ""invisible"" back stabbing and lack of collaboration.  Staff is group ranked by a commitee of their managers peers.  Most of them are not involved in the same business and don't know the people.  Good ranking comes from either: 
1) ""Visibility"" - which means that lots of internal (possibly non-productive) activities like joining social events and schmoozing with your bosses peers. 
or
2) ""Political games"" - where an experienced senior manager makes side deals with some of his peers to mutually support each other favorites for good ranking."

Senior software development engineer,5.0,"May 5, 2010",Former employee,"Microsoft is extremely professional and mature when it comes to software development. If you want to know how to really make software, this is where you want to work.  Also, if you plan to have any kind of health issues, ever, you want to work here as well.  The health benefits are gold plated. And the chances for advancement are good (up to senior level).","If you are not on the software development track you might not have the most fun in the world.  Testers often try to move over to software development.  And PMs seem to change quite frequently.  So some jobs are better than others there. Also, once you reach the senior level it is very, very hard to move up to the next level (architect).  Some groups don't even have an architect assigned to them, so you may never rise above senior level (I certainly couldn't).  Finally, the cafeteria food is not that great."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Sep 25, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","One of the best things about Microsoft is that you are working with smart, motivated people all the time. You will find great challenges and be inspired by your peers on a daily basis. I'm always growing and learning. This can be untrue in certain teams, but in general I've found this to be true for most of the teams I've worked with.

Loads of opportunity to try new things. I've worked on many different products and gained experience in multiple roles. You can truly change your career while staying in the comfort of the same company.","Politics becomes a part of your everyday pretty quickly as you move up in the company. There is a lot of overhead to get sign off on changes and move forward with something new. They want to be agile, but this is the biggest obstacle in actually being good at it. 

There is a lot of pressure for moving up. This is a good thing in a lot of respects, but can be stressful if you find yourself on a competitive team where moving up is difficult, or if you want to coast for a while career wise and focus on other aspects of life. It's not the place you can just do good work and not worry about promotions. If you're not moving up, you are eventually moving out."

People spend years at MS being under-leveled with no path to promotion, and completely subjective decisions because managers are overpowered in this department and actual impact has no effect on their decisions - it's a popularity contest, so if you're not you managers favorite, you're never getting promoted. It's relatively easy to move around to try and correct that but it can also set you back YEARS because your new team doesn't really care about the blood you spilled on the last product.

Managers are just the best IC in the room and have zero actual management skills along with training that just requires them to FF a video and show no proof of competency. This is the biggest issue with Microsoft, they don't hire people that are good managers to be managers - being the best programmer or designer has NOTHING to do with being a good manager and they simply don't get that."

Senior technology specialist,5.0,"Dec 8, 2008",Current employee,"Microsoft offers some of the best benefits imaginable.  From totally free health insurance for the entire family, to generous time off.  After eight years at Microsoft, I received four weeks of vacation this year.  This year, my wife and I also had a baby.  I haven't paid a single penny in health care costs related to either the pregnancy or the labor/delivery and subsequent pediatric care.  No copay, no deductible, nothing.  Microsoft also offers infant care leave for mothers AND fathers.  As a new dad, I received an automatic four weeks paid leave.  Combined with my four weeks of vacation, I took two paid months off of work when my daughter was born.  You simply cannot beat these benefits.  Add to these benefits the 401k matching, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Stock Awards and an incredible pay package and Microsoft simply cannot be beat!","Work, Work, Work!  I work extremely hard and work long hours to exceed my goals.  Oftentimes, there isn't much recognition.  Additionally, because MSFT is a huge company, there are way too many corporate rules and regulations to abide by and the bureaucratic nonsense oftentimes gets in the way of good performance.

Distance to corporate is also a downside.  I work in the field and only make it to Seattle at most twice a year.  Everyone in Redmond lives in an ivory tower and the disconnect between the field and corporate is shocking - from a culture and a realistic perspective."
Software development engineer in test (sdet) ii,3.0,"Jul 10, 2015",Former employee,"I have joined as a L59 and left an L61.
Big PROS are:
- (if you're lucky) having a good manager who can guide you up the career ladder and broaden your horizons
- smart-ass people. You CAN learn every day, if you want to learn.
- good compensation benefits (until idiots who dialed 911 just for a simple scratch forced MS into introducing co-payments for benefits).","- idiot managers. there are still lots of living FOSSILS who are in management positions just because they've been there for 10+ years. All my last manager was doing is still trying to write a powerpoint presentation from time to time, organize weekly meetings, and (most irritating) reminding me to mark my time off whenever I was out. I asked her what to do when I debug stuff until midnight and she didn't know what to tell me.
MS could fire half of its managers and there would not be a difference in engineering process/deliverables.
- ""russian rullette"" people mention online - you really don't know when you will be fired. Yes, you don't know WHEN, because they fire in such a way so that a pattern can not be established.
- the ""curve"". Not sure if it's still there, but having to find 5% of people to fire based on performance was a bit bad, given the strive to only hire the best. The result was dumber new hires than the people fired.
- after 6 years in the company the new hires were offered more than I had. Same level."
Software engineer-ii,3.0,"Jul 2, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year","Competitive salary and great benefits.  I relocated from a less competitive software industry in comparison to Puget Sound, so I'm probably underestimating a good living.  There are a lot of cool things going on at Microsoft.  It feels like you're entering a pretty special company, given its track record.  Regardless of anyone's strengths or weaknesses, you'll encounter some pretty smart people here and it feels good to work with capable people.  There generally feels to be a high standard of technical understanding without penalizing those who don't know everything.   Most managers and peers are friendly and helpful.  The facilities are modern and clean with amenities.  You should have just about any resource you'll need to do the best job you can.","Microsoft is a 10 ton behemoth with who knows how many teams, products, and organizations.  It's unreasonable to believe you can be satisfied with your job just anywhere.  Enjoyment of your job is highly dependent on what team you're on and the specific things you're responsible for.  Some organizations are bound to aging tools, codebases, and other technical debt issues that can make work stressful and uninteresting.  On the other end, there are teams building bleeding edge tools and services that you can nerd out forever on."

The opportunity to continually work on the next generation of software still gets me out of bed every morning excited to come into work and solve hard problems. Microsoft is a company passionate about software quality and the user experience.,"The bureaucracy has gotten works over the years as Microsoft transitioned from being on the cutting edge to ""playing it safe."" I've spent over ten years waiting for the stock to turn around and keep hoping that it will happen some day. The company has done a good job financially but has simply not captured the imagination of customers and investors in the way other tech companies have. Microsoft has become too risk averse."
Principal program manager lead,3.0,"Jan 17, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years","- Great compensation package & benefits
- Smart people
- Hard problems
- Ability to work on products that are used by 1B people","1) Culture. Everyone is giving praise to the ""New Microsoft."" Satya can say all he wants that he's turning the place around and invests in people - but it's not entirely true. You have the same VPs running teams there and they continue to perpetuate favoritism and sexism. There is no safety at Microsoft. You may be okay in a role for a while, until there is a re-org. A new VP comes in and replaces all the leadership with people they know. That job you were waiting around for? Gone. It's given to someone the VP trusts.

Culture is also about how we treat each other. Office politics happen when there is a lack of trust in the workplace. Teams are still competing with the each other for resources. Within teams, managers are playing games to protect their own feature areas and resources. With respect to compensation, it gets worse. While MSFT can say they got rid of the stack rank, it's the same budget for rewards. It's not possible to give everyone a max payout with the budget. This means the VP takes from everyone to give top rewards to a few key performers.

2) If you ever join MSFT, good luck finding your next job. Many recruiters will question your ability to get anything done. There is definitely prejudice against MSFT employees in the valley."

Regardless of whether it's a smart business move, Microsoft has products all over the map. If you're unsure about what you want to work on or want to try something new, Microsoft is a great place for you. Changing teams is very doable.

2) Great place to learn to be a software engineer. I joined right out of college. Engineers at Microsoft are more battle-scarred than those at younger companies.

3) Stability. If you're looking for stability, look no further. Microsoft isn't going anywhere. Even most of those affected by the layoffs found other jobs within Microsoft.","1) Too big and too unfocused. It's too easy to feel like your work isn't significant due to the sheer volume of other stuff going on. A more lean, focused Microsoft would help engineers feel important.

2) Poor matching of college hires to teams. If you're joining right out of college, be very assertive about what you want to work on (that is, if you actually know what you want to work on). They won't put you where you want to be without a fight.

3) Business outlook. Microsoft is doing just fine but is struggling to gain traction in new and emerging markets. Satya's moving things in the right direction but I have doubts that his changes are radical enough. There's also some resistance from those who have been there forever."

* Coworkers are generally good people and nondiscriminatory","* Microsoft's senior leadership talk a good game, but working on a team day to day doesn't reflect the reality
* Way too many egotistical, toxic senior engineers who have coasted for years and silo'd domain knowledge and are ""too technical"" to let go are the ones who truly run the show. Pray you don't find yourself on a team with one of these.
* Outdated tools for building and deploying means even simple straightforward changes are painful to get through, doubly so for legacy products
* Lateral moves are completely self-driven. Nobody really cares about your individual career advancement. Managers are too stressed out to do anything but get their features shipped in time
* People rave about the WLB but this is entirely team dependent and individually driven. I often see people arrive before 8am and don't leave until past 7pm.

Software development engineer in test (sdet) ii,2.0,"May 12, 2009",Current employee,"Training and technical skill development are generally encouraged during your entire career. So if you are the type of person who is always looking to improve your technical skillset, it's as good a place as any for this. Other good points are that the people surrounding you are going to be some of the smartest minds on the planet. This is not an exaggeration. Because of this, on the job training at Microsoft is looked at by most other companies as a very valuable commodity. Indeed, I've had other employers head hunt me strictly based on my experience at MS without even bothering to ask me tech questions in the interviews.","Innovation at Microsoft has unfortunately died. The company will probably never actually fold up or go under, but if you're looking to make your mark on the world and innovate, this is not the place for you. Some of the leadership ladders go twenty levels deep (!) from the leaf node to the CEO. This means that if you are looking to be a vice president or director or some other highly placed leader, you have virtually no chance of getting there from an IC (individual contributor) roll. The amount of people you would have to leap frog is just too many.

Microsoft used to be about the most secure job you could get in the tech industry. However, the latest (second) round of wholesale layoffs, that have nothing to do with the individuals' job performance, should give you pause."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"May 20, 2013","Current employee, more than 5 years","There are lots of opportunities to move around and switch roles if you find yourself stuck or don't like what you're working on.

Now we have to deal with co-pays and lots of confusing bills and paperwork at the doctors office.  With the old plan, you just walked in, gave them your card and you were done.  Now it's just  a pain to deal with plus a lot of out of pocket money if you need surgery or anything expensive.

The whole rating system of forcing 7% of the employees to get the lowest score is ridiculous.  If they tried to force kids in public schools to adhere to this where 7% of them would always be failing just because their peers were doing better, this would be unacceptable.  The system feels forced and not truly based on performance.  Trying to fit to the perfect curve means a lot of people get scores they don't deserve.  (On both ends I might add.)

The other thing that bothers me greatly about Microsoft is the low number of female engineers and a very low number of females in leadership positions.  It's still very much a ""boys club"" here."

Very flexible with commutes and about getting your work done vs. where you're working or when you're in the office. If you do spend a lot of time, there are opportunities to get experience across industries and roles to some extent either voluntarily or involuntarily (if you get reorganized like I did every 6 months!). Because of its size, it's a good place to build your career especially early on since you have ""margin"" for error and lots of resources to support you in your work...","Has become a very large company and become a victim of its own success. Bureaucracy, process have eroded the agility and entrepreneurial culture quite a bit. People are not incentivized always to do what's right for Microsoft and you can learn a lot of bad habits here that will not serve you well in other quarters. Beware of constant reorganizations, incentives that focus on individual achievement over teamwork and narrowly defined roles that pigeonhole or limit your movement/marketability. Your career is maybe 20% under your control and luck will play a big role unfortunately..."
Technical account manager,3.0,"Dec 29, 2014",Former employee,"Great benefits package
Interesting work
Opportunity to have broad impact","There are really two areas that hold Microsoft back from being a great company to work for; both could be easily addressed. First, your experience will depend completely on your manager - good manager = good experience, bad manager = bad experience. Microsoft has failed for a long time to effectively train, develop and mentor their first-tier managers and this is the core of their failures. Second, there is still far too much ""busywork"" that doesn't apply to a particular role's core execution. Does a developer really need to know how to sell a Surface? I agree that ""everybody sells"" but Microsoft seems to be lost in a morass of everybody sells everything...and the portfolio is just to broad and diverse for that to be the case."

They have completely different working style, technologies , people skills & possibly evaluation process. Upper management & HR is really working hard to make it a better place to work, but I think they don't realize that real bottleneck is their hierarchy & too many managers.

There is a clear lobby in Organizations like Office & Windows. I haven't seen such things in Live/MSN. I would love to work for this company if they get rid off leads & managers who are just playing games, checking emails & giving big management lectures w/o having any technical insight. Too much hiearchy comes in a way for company's progress & decision making process.

- In the correct industry for the future, if not exactly seizing those opportunities

- Nice benefits

- Attractive and convenient campus","- Stack-ranking. Microsoft's persistent use and defense of this outdated, intelligence-insulting and ineffective performance evaluation tool continues to fragment and drive away people who are most intellectually prepared to rescue the company. It is not the same model that's being used at other corporations; it is being abandoned at a restless clip at least partially because of Microsoft's very public example of how it fails. The many levels at which stack-ranking has eviscerated Microsoft's culture, environment, product line and innovation are staggering. Prospective candidates for Microsoft employment should really investigate as to whether Google, Apple or some other well-funded tech start-up has opportunities for them until stack-ranking is abolished and new leadership resets their company's priorities. 

- A ""chase-after"" mentality, rather than an inventive one. They've fallen behind the rest of the game, and for obvious reasons that doesn't bode well.

- The inferiority complex tends to permeate all sectors of the company. It's the tech world's Charlie Brown.

- The isolationist culture in Redmond takes away any chance of long-range or visionary goals."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Oct 24, 2014",Current employee,"Much of what's been said about the company is true - it's a fascinating and often challenging place to work with smart people on tough problems or cool products that impact or are used by millions of users. When it's good, it's great. I worked on internal-facing/supporting teams and released products and they were both gratifying. The changes during Satya's tenure are promising, but not with impact. The culture is good, but there's still a lot of ""old skool"" and elitist thinking. I had a great career there, was well compensated, and provided plenty of opportunities to learn and have an impact.","The company has great values, and in it's recent efforts to become more relevant again (and undo some of the bad publicity wrought by Ballmer's waning years) it has really reminded the industry that they are still a force to be reckoned with. Purse strings and resources are getting tighter and this makes it difficult. The recent layoffs don't seem really smartly planned, with lots of great people being let go while other non-performers remain. Benefits are still good, but have been reduced year over year to where they aren't much better than anyone else's. I remain bullish on Microsoft's future, but think they have a way to go to get to where they want to be."

When you get a good manager, the opportunities are vast and you can make an impact.
They understand when you need time off.
The shuttle system is excellent
The connector system is AWESOME!
They can take and even welcome criticism (to an limit I think)
The level of intelligence at MSFT is 2nd to no one.
The people are generally warm to work with.
When they focus on something, they really dig in and get it done properly.","The amount of re-organizations (re-orgs) stifles productivity, promotes confusion and continually leads to bad middle management.
If you do NOT get a good manager in your next re-org, good luck. It can be a death sentence.
You really have to work 12+ hours a day to be able to be seen as promotable. (though they will not agree with that statement).
The awards system is really nothing more than a round robin method of handing next level promotions.
With the intelligence comes the arrogance level, 2nd to no one (maybe).
The inability of middle and senior management to allow for true innovation at the ground level. If you're not working on the team or technology you are best at, you're essentially losing your skill set day by day."

Ample free parking (kind of running short in various buildings in Redmond) and free coffee and pop. Good pay.  Medical benefits used to be good prior to 2013, but not anymore.","Probably the world's worst employee rating and review system. You can't just be happy with your job and do that really well -- they want you to move up the chain or they'll cut you out. It is a dictatorial company, where information and instructions always goes downstream to the subordinates, but any improvement ideas never make it up the chain and are usually terminated at your immediate manager level.  Microsoft management in general have very fragile egos (probably due to their nerdy nature) and will only promote those who kiss up to them (by promote I mean give them good rating at review time). Medical benefit is no longer a magnate to bring engineers to Microsoft as it kind of sucks for people who are not in perfect shape.  Microsoft lays off large number of people and entire groups occasionally and the last large layoff was really targeted at the older employees (40-45 plus) probably due to insurance cost savings, so don't consider a Microsoft job as a safe job by any means.  Management never want to hear real concerns. They shut you down at your team level and don't allow true feelings find their way up the chain."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Feb 26, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years","Microsoft is a good place to work. The offices are nice, the people are smart. The company tries hard to focus on employee development. 

Considering the size of the company, Microsoft is a well run business in most respects. Planning processes are well defined and executed. Organization structure is clear. People are very willing to work in a matrix and collaborate.","Speed. While more aggressive companies are focused on what they will ship 3 weeks or 3 months from now, Microsoft operates on very long cycles - 2 to 4 years. As a result, Microsoft has the unique ability to be both too early and too late in a given market. 

Take mobile or tablets. Microsoft shipped product years before other companies. But when Apple demonstrated the first successful model, it took years for Microsoft to emulate. 

Political complexity. Efforts to operate as ""one Microsoft"" often hinder success of individual groups. Take Office for the iPad. Where is it? Office Mac is also a terrible product. 

Leadership is a mixed bag. The leadership ranks at Microsoft include some of the best and some of the worst leaders you will find. Question of luck."
Senior program manager,2.0,"Nov 10, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years","Generally good benefits (though they've been cutting back in recent years).  Very sharp to excellent developers, testers, and PM individual contributors to work with.","WAY too many managers (and of those, only a small percentage are of any real benefit to their teams or the company).  During my MBA we studied Jack Welsh, former GE CEO and Chief Executive Magazine ""CEO of the year"".  I recall Welsh noting that ""managers should have ten (10) direct reports at the minimum, and 30 to 50 percent more if they are experienced"" - that would be 12 to 15 direct-reports for a good manager.  The teams I worked with in Windows Division and Developer Division had only 3 to 5 reports for each manager.  Not only did this create on-going fiefdoms and turf battles but also lead to to excessive micromanagement.  Many managers provided little real value to their team or the company.  (And for many, their overriding focus seemed to be on their next promotion and bonus.)  Customer needs and what was best for Microsoft were frequently sacrificed for bogus features sold to make the manager ""look good"".  Once released, new products often fell flat so the next year they'd be off pushing some other idea (which often again, didn't meet any real customer needs).  (It seemed that many managers are just going through the motions and putting in time to get their tenured ""partner"" status.)  I got tired of the silly politics, fiefdoms, turf wars, and micromanagement.  After 7 years at MS I resigned and am now at Google (so far, much better)."

The benefits were also great.  I don't have kids, but it seemed great for people with kids.  If your kid gets sick, you can just work from home for a day.  The flexibility is amazing.

In general, work life balance at Microsoft is great for the life part of the equation, but not so great for the work part of it.",I hear this is different at other parts of the company but I was working in the US M&O.  It's supposedly a marketing group but no marketing gets done.

Director,3.0,"Apr 28, 2015","Former employee, more than 8 years","Microsoft people are incredibly bright.  They are certainly above average when compared to most companies (that are not tech companies).  When working on a good team, you will find that your work product excels and exceeds what you could accomplish alone.

Also, as Microsoft is an incredibly large organization, it can offer lots of possibilities -- different careers, products, geographies, and experiences.  This is almost unparalleled even in other large multi nationals.  At worst, you will be exposed to people from all over the world with different viewpoints and priorities and this is always a good thing.","When I left, and I have heard it is changing, Microsoft had become very bureaucratic.  Unfortunately, trying to get hings done required the synchronization of many groups and there was often no incentive for alignment.  even if management was aligned, the front line troops often weren't, which meant things would not get done.  And being a large organization, blame was rarely applied.

Also, the evaluation system, which has also been changed and should be investigated, was one that created individual rewards at team expense.  Provided that that has been changed, this may not longer be an issue.

Regardless, try to find a group that is as autonomous as possible and a boss that has a reputation for fighting for his employees, as that will always be key in a large organization."

- Company is huge so there is a lot of space to find interesting projects in almost any computer science field.
- Company invests in teaching. There is an entire division dedicated to internal education and you can learn a lot if you are driven and plan your time well. You get time off for this so it is not double duty.
- In my experience the people are professional and friendly especially if you are an engineer up to mid-level management (dev leads, dev managers). 
- Ballmer is gone. The new guy Satya seems to know what he is doing. I get this from the many friends I have left at Microsoft and from watching the public moves the company makes. 
- They are stongly poitioned to take advantage of the cloud revolution (Azure is a distant number two after Amazon)","- There is some politics from mid-level up (quite a lot). This affects everybody because it results in teams being realigned, moved around, competing projects etc. 
- Company has the two cash cows struggling. Windows ecosystem (outside cloud) is disappearing and Office has some stiff competition. But they are trying to do the right thing

Basically if you're maybe in highschool or starting college this might be a decent job, otherwise I can't recommend it.","Moving up in the company is not easy at all, espically when your manager favors hiring externally instead of promoting internally. There's huge problems with favoritism, and Store Managers work horribly under any type of stress. You're constantly reminded the retail stores aren't making the company any money, and that your employment is almost a gift. Yearly, the entire company structure changes and you're expected to immediately fit into their new mold. While there is zero commission, you're expected to sell like your job depends on it. People with absolutely no experience whom have just started with the company get promoted over people who have worked there for years since tenure isn't looked at for growth. 
Work environment can be fun however a lot of times its extremely childish and ridiculous with constant cheering, clapping, yelling. If you go through their NSO program you'll know all about this. Most of the time you're treated like you're in kindergarden. 
Bonus is based on sales and customer satisfaction survey. However, if your store isn't making huge business sales, your bonus will never amount to anything. Raises are yearly and the absolute most you can make is 4%. Most employees only get 2% raise. It's pretty horrible."

In smaller companies a person can be pigeon holed into a given role whereas at Microsoft one can move from role to role, often across disciplines if one is able to show good results constantly.  A big reason that I am proud to work at Microsoft is also the company’s commitment to supporting good causes, which includes generous 1:1 matching for charitable donations, and Microsoft even pays $17/hour to charities where the employees volunteers time.  It makes me happy to know that a good portion of our profits goes to make the world a better place, even though for financial reasons I am not able to work directly in a charitable organization.","It is hard to figure out how to move from a individual contributor role to a management position.  The first jump into management is the hardest and it seems like a good percentage of people make the leap through politics (who you know) vs. merits. Also, the promotion speed in the field is much slower than that of Redmond, which doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense to me."

Makes sense from the ""protect your own brand"" point of view, but I found it really annoying to be closed to great technologies you have access in all the other companies (let's say, to use Ruby/Python for a side team stats project, you will probably be looked at like a weird being). That for sure makes you fall behind other engineers in the market, limiting your scope of development.

The so known calibration at the yearly performance review creates a working environment of ""I won't help you because I don't want you to be above me"", and I really felt that, I was even criticized for helping other teams in my organization because I should had give total priority on my team (it's not that I was not doing anything for my team, but I was the one that could help the other teams and that also benefited us)."

I found management to be very understanding anytime I needed time off, and also management was OK with varying my daily start and stop times as long as the work was getting done and as long as others were not negatively affected.  I feel that pay was good, and benefits especially healthcare, were better than any other company.","In the past Microsoft had too many re-organizations, often every 6-9 months (however re-organizations do allow for re-filling the organization budget frequently).  Some managers are not good people managers, others are great.  The employee future career path is completely the responsibility of the employee (probably not really a con though I think it bears mentioning).  During annual review time everyone's review numbers, i.e., pay raise, bonus, stock grants, etc., are decided by management about a month before the manager/employee annual review conversations actually happen, which I feel does not properly allow the employee to show or prove to the manager what benefits and successes the employee has had over the past year."
Principal software engineer,3.0,"Mar 29, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years","I think now that MS has real competition, it has sharpened its focus, has become more open minded and has broadened its willingness to consider new opportunities, risks, and models, even open source which was blasphemous back in the days of mR. ballmer. 

Glad to see Satya  in charge (and ballmer long gone). Its a good time to consider MS!","Many things pop-up when you've been somewhere for decades, but one thing that I like to mention here is this HR policy, where even if you have years of industry experience, or even if you are technically qualified, yet you are treated as a college hire no matter if a hiring team might find you as fully qualified or not. 

Basically, hiring teams don't really get to see you in order to evaluate your qualification unless they have a req for a college hire. This means that you as a candidate have less opportunities since you are pushed into a smaller set of job-opening (and auto-rejected from industry-hire category), and you as a hiring team are being excluded from considering candidates that are technically qualified.

This seems insane, policy trumps qualification! 

It was like this when I joined back the end of the last century! Crazy that such an irrational policy is still the HR mantra.

I can  whine about stack ranking and such, but many people have in the past, so I'll let it go."

If, for example, a department wants to stretch its headcount dollars to add extra heads without officially getting any new headcount budget, managers will make it their fulltime jobs to convert a sufficient number of good performers into bad performers through review management techniques that slingshot off a review system that requires an employee and the employee’s colleagues to serve up areas of vulnerability under the disguise of opportunities for growth. In reality, there is generally nothing egregiously wrong with the employee’s performance. It is just that the employee happens to have fallen into the path of the manager’s short-term measure of success and so will be chewed up and spit out.

Microsoft is a fantastic place to work, and I highly recommend it! Come and join us.","The salary, while competitive isn't as high in some cases as in other companies.  You have to wait a long time to receive benefits such as stock options and other rewards.  The company invests in you, but you have to wait and invest your time and career to actually see the reward.  Bonuses are usually quite low, and stock awards take years to divest, so you only see part of the money immediately.  For other awards, you'll have to wait for several years, before being able to use it. The last thing is tenure, seems like that's important and is able to get you promoted faster than newbies."

Microsoft is probably involved in it, and you can be a part of our work to become the leader or, if we are already the best in the field, to improve the state of the art.  Money is not an obstacle.  The lower ranks can bring significant change to products.

The development process.  There are some downsides to the systems and bureaucracy at MS, but after being in the business for 30 years, they are trying their best to improve and bring consistency to the way software is written.  Having worked for companies that do not care about a product other than getting it out the door, this is a huge win.","The location.  To live in a city with nightlife (or _any_ entertainment), you must suffer an hour-long commute each way in heavy traffic.

The speed of the company as a whole.  Don't get me wrong - individual product units can be very agile and work cross-team (hundreds of employees), but to really mobilize across entire organizations takes multiple releases.  This can sometimes mean that the customer has to wait, which is frustrating for anyone who has come from a small-company background.

The lack of attrition.  I don't know anyone who has been fired from Microsoft.  I have not met many people who deserve it, but when you do find them, you really question the management of the company."

Microsoft would do well to have an internal recruiting program. When looking for other positions internally, HR would only offer, ""Use the Career site and your network"". I could have used help in finding roles that lined up with my skillset and interests. 
Sometimes I felt like Microsoft management HR mindset was, ""Employees are our most valuable asset!! ...well, perhaps not you, specifically... but employees, in general, are our greatest asset!!!""
At times, Microsoft would publicly support or not support particular polarizing social issues that were not directly related to the product or service or customer set. I don't think this behavior is appropriate for any public company."

You question how they got where they did - they don't know what it takes to build an organization, culture, transparency, nor do they care.  Its everyone for themselves - very little team mentality, support, sharing of information.  Culture is bad.  Little attention is spent on mapping out a master plan for an organization, so you end up doing a lot of work that doesn't appear meaningful and end up thinking that Microsoft makes money in spite of itself.  Managers aren't rewarded for developing people underneath them - i.e. if people get promoted, that isn't rewarded.  So, who will cares about your success?  only you.  No career advisor or someone who will be a champion for you.  You have to sell yourself and figure it out on your own.

Different divisions or teams can vary widely in terms of working environment. You may land in a good place, as I said before. But you may land at some bad places, where the environment is almost hostile, and all interactions are very loaded. You may spend more time dealing with the inner politics of management and your co-workers than with actual work. It may also have rather unreasonable working hours and make your life quite stressful. Finally, even though employees are supposed to move between teams fairly easily, that may not always be the case, and you may see yourself stuck in a not so desirable situation."

My team and I found that if you don't live in Redmond or Bellevue, it's much harder to feel included as part of the larger team and very hard to be promoted or recognized for your full contribution. They had a ranking-style ""bucket"" review system that meant that someone always had to be put in the ""bottom bucket"", an awkward situation for any manager. My team and I found that our manager preferred to put his out-of-towners in those bottom buckets, and it was harder for us to defend ourselves against this action from afar. We had to push to be invited to visit Bellevue or Redmond, and our requests were often delayed or denied, so it seemed like we were held in remote reserve for the convenience of being put in the bottom bucket. We felt like orphans, to be sure. Our boss generally did not like working with remote employees, and we could not have been more aware of that fact.

Industy experience: There are some very cool things going on in a variety of industries that Microsoft is playing in.  Getting involved in these projects can be exciting and even historic in many cases.
Internal flexibility: If you don't like your job, boss, team, building location, or even industry, take a look around internally and dip your toes in the water somewhere else.  It is pretty easy to maneuver the internal job market.","Slow to react to industry trends: Microsoft has been historically about 2-3 years behind where they should be from an innovation perspective.  See next point for the reason why.
Too many meetings and approvals needed to make decisions: I can't stress this enough.  Be prepared to move VERY, VERY slowly to get almost anything accomplished.
Too many overlapping functions: There's fat in many of the organizations that could be trimmed.  Another reason why it takes so long to make decisions.
Engineering dominates most business strategies and decisions: This is how Microsoft was built, and it still exists in the corporate culture today.  Not a bad thing, unless you're on the business side and you want to try and do the job you were hired for."

At the end of the day, they just care about a job well done","- Groups are hit or miss. Sometimes you're working within a great organization with an exemplary leader, other times you're not. The company is so big, it's best to do your research on each organization as if it were it's own separate business
- There is a lot of resistance to ""outside of the box"" thinking. Senior management is well aware of the public's perception of Microsoft's lack of creativity in terms of marketing, but it often felt as though they were powerless, hence so are you
- While you do get compensated well enough, you must consider the amount of hours being put in. When that's considered, you're not necessarily being paid as much as you think.
- The majority of people here are Type A personalities, so be ready to keep up
- In the pursuit of upward mobility, you can EASILY lose a sense of work/life balance. Be careful. You need to always put your personal life first.

While there are many product areas, my impression is that exploring other teams and trying to transfer to another is strongly discouraged. Transfering to a different division is even more of a challenge.

Not much support by management to explore areas of interest in terms of new tools or technologies. This might have been a culture trait of my team.

Lots of redundant menial work that should be automated, but no bandwidth given to work on tools for these. Also a lot of the existing tools were slow or error prone and needed to be improved or redone, but again no bandwidth given for these.

Internal transfer between teams is allowed (compensation and level wont change even though you have the experience) so you can get a diverse experience (server side stuff, devices etc. ). As long as you have the skills you can also try out different roles like SDE, SDET, and PM. Some of the teams have excellent software engineering practices.

Many times new college hires earn more than experienced candidates. When joining please do your homework and negotiate a proper level and compensation. Once you are in it is almost impossible to reach your expected level. Even though management says promotions are based on contributions and not based on the time served in the company in practice it is actually opposite.

Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jun 5, 2018","Former employee, more than 3 years","Smart people, great potential, lots of big challenges to solve, good teams. Good benefits and lots of support.","Upper management is cultish, plays favorites and disregards feedback. The ""values"" are there for everyone else to be evaluated on and not necessarily applicable to upper management.  The time spent on connects and documenting your work can be overwhelming if you are looking to get recognized for your work.

At times, the work you do is not easy to connect to actual value and it is hard to justify the time and effort spent on it. Work/life balance at upper management is hardly existent.

Mobility between teams is dependent on headcount availability and you will chase an internal job the same way external resources are. Just because you work there (insert group name), that doesn't mean you can work here (insert group name).

Word of advice: 
Research your manager and make sure your ""priorities"" line up with his/hers. Depending on the person you work for, you may find that you can be pushed out in ways you never actually even conceived of. 

The ""partners"" are very adept at playing Microsoft's version of the game of thrones, using the ICs and lower management to advance their priorities. 
Especially applicable to the people that have been in the company for 15/20years and up and are not interested in anything to do with the life outside of the MS bubble. Or the newly ""made"" partners looking to prove him/herself."

Satya promotes a good overall direction.","Work-life balance can be rough if you're a software engineer in certain orgs. Most engineers I met were forced into participating in on-call support rotations. When you're on-call, be prepared to skip most travel or any event where you can't reach a laptop to be online to respond within 10 minutes. 

We were told by management that, in order to meet our requirements, we should avoid going to movies, sporting events, and to avoid areas where cell service wasn't consistent, and anywhere that we couldn't get internet service quickly. Be ready to skip workout classes, school events, long walks, or even scenarios where you may potentially get stuck in traffic. 

These on-call shifts may last for a few hours/day up to an entire week at a time depending on your team's rotation policy. There is no real compensation for work done during on-call shifts or for being on call. Your manager may give you some flexibility in your working hours to compensate.

Some upper managers are really into doublespeak and cognitive dissonance. When multiple teams were laid off to move headcount to sites in other countries (without reasoning given), the VP of the org bragged of record growth and profits while simultaneously telling everyone that they need to tighten up and work harder because they were now inexplicably short-staffed."

Software development engineer,5.0,"Nov 6, 2008",Current employee,"Most of the people here are really smart. There's so much going on at the company and they've been at this forever - Microsoft knows how to ship a product. The volume of information (and professional development resources) available to employees is enormous. If you want to work on products the entire world uses, look no further.

Compensation and benefits are both very good. There's a lot of emphasis put on individual career development. In terms of social responsibility, they're very generous and proactive re: corporate giving and volunteer work.","There can be a lot of red tape. Sometimes you can get the feeling that you're spending more time talking about what is going to be done than actually doing it. This is both good and bad: your plan is always rock solid but because of all the time spent planning you have less time for the work itself.

Depending on the team there can be pressure to ""just get the job done"" whether or not that means working reasonable hours. In my experience this is cyclical.

There can also be politics to deal with since, after all, this is a big company.

There can be reluctance to embrace non-Microsoft technologies, particularly open source ones. Some of this is valid from a legal perspective (Microsoft is a big target and can get away with a lot less than a smaller company which is off the radar) but regardless of the actual reasons this can make it take longer to get the job done."

Decent compensation.
Most people are very friendly and good to work with.  
It is relatively easy to move positions within the company to seek new challenges.","A lot of process is needed to guide a ship as big as Microsoft but the company is often a slave to the process instead of effectively using it as a tool.

It is a very political environment.  The best way to ""succeed"" is the spend a significant proportion of your time selling your accomplishments up the management chain.  It is an environment where self-promotion is key.

A lot of attention is paid to ""level"" of employees.  New hires are often brought in at relatively high levels but can't perform.  Despite their poor performance they continue to be chosen to lead projects because of their “level”.  There are now many people in the Principal level-band while I’d say less than half deserve to be there.

Decisions are often made at the upper management / executive levels with zero visibility provided.  Why was this product/feature cut?  Why are we putting more resources on project X?  It is expected that the worker ants will just do what they are told.  They don't need to understand why."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Nov 25, 2019",Current employee,"Satya Nadella has the right vision and direction for the company.  He understands how to make the company successful. 

Pay and benefits is exceptional. Flexible work, autonomous work environment. Excellent company and work environment to be an individual contributor in.","Microsoft Services is the worst place to work in a manager role, if you have the option do not come in as a manager. Being an individual contributor  in services was great and the work was highly impactful. As a manager here it is utter chaos, and this is coming from someone with a lot of leadership experience in other roles and companies. Other managers, in attempts to justify their own roles and existence, make up side projects for mid to upper management that never serve a purpose to our clients yet they cannot perform the basics in their own role. Leadership is incompetent enough to fall for this charade time and time again, meanwhile the managers that aren’t busy brown nosing are the ones keeping the business afloat. This is the worst organization I’ve ever been a leader in and if I had to do it again I would never have become a manager here. Run away before you get sucked into this dumpster fire of fifedoms, favorites, and meaningless work."
Customer success manager,4.0,"Feb 22, 2021","Current employee, more than 5 years","Pay and compensation regularly above market. Remote work has been always available, and a giant organization gives employees the opportunity to explore all kinds of interests and resources. Culture of inclusion pivoting to hire from ""non-traditional"" backgrounds is beginning to build an interesting and diverse workforce. Strong Senior Leadership. Great benefits, tuition reimbursement especially. Skilling focus, self-managed growth and learning opportunities, and the name recognition that can be quite impressive to external hiring.","Benefits standard for tech, but on the lower rungs (retail, employees sub. <60,000) the co-pays can be impactful. Difficult to time tuition reimbursements to ""real"" college semesters, best to apply yearly instead.

Management in direct teams are under so much pressure to perform that they can in turn overwhelm or give conflicting information on a day-to-day basis. Low retail-to-corporate transition pipeline exacerbated by shuttering of retail stores in favor of hub model. Poor communication when internal hires are concerned. 

Rarely hear back from hiring managers or recruitment agents unless you are being hired. No feedback on interviews that do not result in a hire. Promises for temporary roles to become permanent that never materialize and return now over-skilled employees to lower rungs, making even moving forward in another organization difficult.

Quarterly team rotations leave customers with few resources that they know directly, and employees are often placed on a merry-go-round of ""find new person in charge."""

""If you're a technologist and can't get hired directly into a research group - you really don't want to work for Microsoft today. Microsoft has suffered horribly since Ballmer took over. He's a marketer. He was always the guy who'd come stomping down the hallway going ""I WANT WHAT I WANT"". We'd explain that the products couldn't actually do that and the reaction would be along the lines of ""AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?"" If it was important, we'd take the technical facts to Bill, and Bill would intervene and shut him down. It was a decent balance of power. Ballmer's drive to do the impossible would get Bill to do things he wasn't inclined to do, but only if they were POSSIBLE. Yes, there was a time when I loved Microsoft and worked with great enthusiasm in that niche of the ""not technically impossible"". I did a lot of risky things knowing that I could always count on Bill to rein things in when I could prove they weren't technically possible, or so difficult they simply weren't practical. 

But Bill is gone now. Since taking over, Ballmer has promoted other similarly-minded marketers around him, so now he's completely cocooned in layers of marketing fluff with absolutely no basis in reality. He doesn't know the difference between an actual product and a picture of a product. And just to improve the whole customer-focus and employee-focus thing - he's imported old IBM (Kevin Johson) and legacy Wal-Mart (Kevin Turner). """
Site manager ii,4.0,"Mar 12, 2010",Current employee,"Microsoft is a huge company with tons of opportunity and lots of places to work. By moving between the different divisions (MSN, Entertainment, Office, Windows) it can feel essentially like moving to a whole new company, only without losing seniority or having to figure out a new benefits package or even a new commute. The company values work/life balnce (at least my areas in it have) and there are also a lot of smart people that you work with on a daily basis. The benefits package is outstanding, and overall the company seems to truly value employee rentention.","Microsoft is middle aged, and it shows. The company has got so large that it's often impossible to get anything done. I feel like I spend 2 days per week explaing what I might do, 1 day actually doing it, and then the following 2 days defending what I just did. The company as a whole also still fundamentally fails to understand the web and how to navigate it. That said, the penny has dropped that cloud computing is coming, and will be disruptive. Either Microsoft will get on board or it will be swept away. It's going to be a bumpy ride, but in the end Microsoft will get there, and I think there's a lot of room for growth for those with the right experience to help it navigate the way."

It's the tech-equivalent of a Detroit car manufacturer: slow, boring, silo'ed, and process-oriented. You don't get any end-to-end responsibilities unless you've been there for 20 years and have finally 'served' enough time to make Corporate Vice President. Even then, there's a ton of pointless politics and absolute lack of regard for how simple the offering should be and how to serve the customer. Half the time, nobody knows what the hell is going on in the organization. The company is so big and bloated that there's so much duplicate work going on, and zero ownership given to young, motivated, smart people. You're expected to 'shut up and learn', and don't suggest or question anything until you've been around for as many years as it takes for someone to forget when you joined.

For a dozen of really good working bees, there would be one smart guy who only knows how to manage his own career. Most probably it is a ""middle manager"", because new hires get filtered out quite effectively. So how those career-focused people survive? - They create ""processes"" and ""initiatives"", and then you are the one to fight back.

Years of business division model managed by individual P/L fiscal responsibilities meant less risky to focus on incremental improvements on products so sales can grow a certain % in each fiscal year. And the 'follow the market' approach to product development meant consistently a few cycles behind market makers. Even with the recent re-orgs instituted by Ballmer, the top ranks are still predominantly sales people, who are best at driving and managing sales organizations. Plus a top-heavy culture means conformity (to a sales-oriented culture, as opposed to a more bottom-up engineering and product-focused one) is preferred, and very difficult for grassroots innovation to make ground."

The company values have gentled over time to emphasize happier, healthier employees who don't feel worked to death.  Real commitment to good corporate citizenship.

As a company, very much likes to promote from within.","Admins are just not getting the comp packages they deserve.  Pay stalls hard in the 56-57 bands. You must be part of a two-income household to even pay rent, much less own, as a Microsoft admin.  You are not bonus eligible.  Raises run around 2-3 percent, which can be less than a rent payment.

It is a very broad position, depending on your manager. You clean offices for new hires, set up new PCs, negotiate for office space, may manage budgets. Responsibilities merge with the much more highly paid Business Manager position which can be very hard to get (and will always be underlevelled for an admin making the jump).

* My team had 6 managers and 12 individual contributors--a 1:2 ratio. Managers had nothing to do except micromanage and then start managing each other's ICs.

* There was too much focus on the bright, shiny object that was an abject failure, and those who actually produced useful things for customers got little credit or support. Plus, we had to work harder to get things done in spite of having to waste our time on the bright, shiny object.

* Microsoft is quietly getting rid of its older workers. With each layoff, even those that are supposedly to ""fix"" the phone division debacle, older workers in other divisions are also laid off. They are often rehired later as a contractor at a substantially reduced rate.

* Management in my division made it very clear that any new hiring or replacements for those who quit would  not be in the US. There is talent in this country, but Microsoft isn't willing to pay for it.

* Because of the internal politics and processes, any real innovation happens due to acquisitions and mergers.

Principal program manager,3.0,"Jul 18, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","Microsoft has a great working atmosphere that is better than most companies in the world.  Pay and benefits have improved in the last few years and are hard to beat.  Despite many frustrations with the Microsoft is a great company to work for.  

Microsoft is trying to change it's culture to be more contribution and using the ideas of the greater company.  It remains to be seen if this will happen. This change in culture will be one of the most positive changes the company has if it is successful.   In two years I would love to update this review to see if it really will make an impact.","Work life balance and internal politics often make the company a frustrating place to work.  While I have heard of groups where the work culture is relaxed, I have never seen them or been a part of it.  Internal advancement and opportunities can be very frustrating to understand and difficult to understand.  

Many senior and middle managers still believe in a culture of intimidation and oppressive culture.  There is a move to try and change this culture but these behaviors are hard change.  I have high hopes for Microsoft, though it's future remains cloudy."
Product development director,3.0,"May 19, 2015","Former employee, more than 1 year","As you would expect, Microsoft is a very interesting and dynamic company.  When we joined after the Nokia acquisition, we were very interested in getting to know a little about Microsoft from the inside.  Nokia was one of the biggest acquisitions made by Microsoft and that change along with the already significant changes going on removing silos was an interesting thing to observer and try to understand.","We were already in a precarious situation at the time of the acquisition and I was glad to see Microsoft move fairly quickly to make decisions on the future of all of the Nokia phone businesses.  It was assumed and became clear that all they were interested in was the Windows Phone business and announced 3 months after the deal closed that they were shutting down the rest.  From that point on, it was clear that our teams were going to be shut down as well, but it took another 9 months for that to happen without a real idea of when it would be.

It would be best to work at a main Microsoft/Nokia site (i.e. Redmond or Finland).  Otherwise, like most companies, not going to live for long.  However, the sales and consulting roles in different regions are an exception."

- Lots of people who help you succeed! I was lucky to have an amazing mentor and a fantastic manager.
- If you get bored with one problem, you can always move on to something else that is equally interesting. Microsoft really offers a wide variety of problems to work on (from games to enterprise software to search to mobile phones to operating systems to ...)","- People are really competitive here. If you are in a team of more senior people, then you don't have to worry much but if you are in a team with more junior people (i.e. ones who are closer to your level), then it can get messy really quick as everyone is trying to proof how their contributions matter the most.
- Frequent reorgs and changes in strategy. If you are one of those people who can switch directions fast, then you can thrive over here. However if you are one of those people who get really attached to your work, then the reorgs will have a toll on you."

Company events are usually pretty good  - I particularly enjoyed TechReady every year.   Great place to learn about other Microsoft products that you may not have any prior experience with - lots of internal resources to leverage when you want to explore something new.    Lots of smart co-workers - as long as you're not management, you can almost guarantee that your peers won't be idiots.","Extremely likely that the quality of your work will have exactly zero impact on how you are perceived (and rewarded) by management.   It's really just a popularity contest, and there aren't any checks and balances on this process.   You could be the smartest guy on the planet, delivering the most amazing solutions, generating nothing but love from your customers, but if you didn't happen to work with your practice manager at his previous company, or don't golf with him, etc - you can probably forget about recognition.   Seriously, this isn't sour grapes here (I was actually pretty well rewarded), but the VAST majority of smart, hard-working people are ignored at best, and taken advantage of at worst."

It's like having all the smartest kids in the class in the same stadium, all wildly waving their hands in the air so they get called on next.  

But seriously, it is a great place to work for a while if you like a challenge and the opportunity to do something with huge numbers and impact.","Hyper competitive culture means that you spend more time on internal politics than succeeding in the market.  Seriously, it was easier to gain market share with an existing product than go through the hassle of launching a new one. 

The wrong folks are rewarded - predicting hockey stick growth charts is critical to getting new funding - after all, nobody cares about a business that won't make a billion $ with 50% margins.  So the inflated growth charts are made, funding given based on those charts, and then the 'responsible' execs move on to their next promotion, leaving somebody else to hold the bag when projections aren't met.  I've seen it happen over and over.

Finally, as Microsoft makes the transition from a growth company to a cash cow, there's a lot of internal dislocation and the internal culture suffers."
Director,5.0,"Mar 21, 2018","Former employee, more than 10 years","Great people is number one reason to work at Microsoft, regardless of what role or position, you will be surrounded by the most talented, passionate and driven people.  You will have the opportunity to have impact at every level and be part of a very flat organization where you are truly a peer to everyone on various teams you'll work with.  Great benefits and competitive compensation package is part of the attraction. You will learn from your mistakes and as long as they are the same mistake repeated, you will thrive which is unusual in it's own right.","Must be able to deal with ambiguity and constant organization changes and you will have much turnover in your management, especially your direct manager.  Buckle up your seat belt, the ride can be unsettling if you are not used to constant change.  You also cannot wait around to be told what to do and you must adhere to the fact that he or she who has a plan, however tentative will win the day in any meeting.  You also must maintain a high energy and always meet your objectives at a minimum while exceeding expectations is considered a must or you will be shuffled out quickly."
Senior account executive,1.0,"Sep 25, 2018",Current employee,The name. Only the name. The lie is that you'll get paid a ton of money. The truth is its 100% biased on whether you manager likes you,"Get rid of your re-branded rankings. The zero rewards is a scarlet letter and unfair. It's a way to give people your manager likes (even if they under-perform) a ton of money and leave you with nothing to force you to quit. There's no way out of it. None. Many of the managers are immoral and protected and they have ALL power in their hands with no accountability for their actions (I've even heard managers joke about it over dinner). If they don't like you, they will take all your credit, give you all their blame, and bully you until you quit. I've personally stopped 2 suicide attempts from manager bullying since I've been here. This is not a game, this is people's livelihood. I've also seen people given offers to fake positions just to let go of them one month later into the new role. Look it up! There is so much corruption and bias."

Senior software development engineer,2.0,"Aug 12, 2013","Former employee, more than 10 years","It has several great systems in place and was a great company in the past.
If you are a just starting your career, Microsoft is a great place to work for two years.  You can learn a lot about how a big company works and take all that knowledge with you. Technology wise, they only use Microsoft software which is bad if you want to join other technology company that maybe built on open source software.","It kills your potential. 
To succeed in Microsoft the primary skill you need is perception management. That means you need to be a great politician. If you are busy working and doing the right thing for the company without playing the game, be sure some else will take the credit for your work. Actually doing the right thing for the company is a bad thing for you. Your focus should be only in growing your manager’s kingdom that may include sabotaging their competition and doing what is wrong for the company. 
The company is setup to hire young people and get rid of the old. So you have a medical plan that you probably won’t use much anyway. Since 2013, the medical plan is not that great anymore.
In the end, keep your eye on the ball which is to maximize the benefits you can get out of Microsoft.  If you spend your time in doing the right thing, do not expect the same in return. Do it knowing you will not get the same in return."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Mar 22, 2015",Current employee,"Used to be a big company, so some people may still think it as a good enough IT company. Or belongs to the first tier. Not the top pay company, but is good.","1. The Windows technology is not used by the world. And it's going downward, so your experience at Microsoft will no longer help you when you find new jobs outside. Because everybody else are using something different.
2. The Benefit is going down. The medicals increased deductible, like 3K for two people family. 3.75K for family with 1 kid.
3. bureaucracy and politics. Now revolution is going on, like agile(ship monthly), flatten structural, merged engineering. But the many level of leads and managers are not going away. After a while, they fall back to their previous role. The lead now doesn't own head count, but they are doing exactly the same thing as before. That's pushing others.
4. The famous Stack ranking system. It is being revolutionized, but it's still there. And now Microsoft have a lot of crazy policies like: if you didn't get good review last year, you can't move within Microsoft, you have to leave for other company. If you leave Microsoft as FTE, you can't work for it until 6 months later even as vendor. My friend was just forced out of MS, now they don't fire you, they ask you to voluntarily resign from MS, with very small amount of money no matter how many years you have served here.
MS is becoming more and more mean, and less sympathy here."
