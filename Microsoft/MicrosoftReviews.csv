Great products
Stability",Average pay compared to competitors
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jan 28, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade""."
Product manager 2,2.0,"Aug 6, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","A decent salary and benefits, all things considered","The expectation to grow products exponentially, but bureaucracy and lack of autonomy hamper your ability to actually execute on any sort of ambitious vision."
Product manager,4.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","* I constantly felt like there was a steady flow of very talented people, Not only are people brilliant but also open to mutual growth and learning.
* Exceptional cultural patience, especially within the New England management team, where time and space were generously given for individuals to grow and integrate.
* The company’s scale and appetite for calculated risk created abundant opportunities, which I was empowered to pursue and make the most of really making for an awesome career.
* Microsoft has a remarkable ability to hire genuinely kind and caring individuals. I deeply valued and admired the ICs I worked alongside.","* Senior leadership(CVP level) often impedes progress with decisions that feel disconnected from the realities of product development and customer needs. CVPs and above are disjoint from building and customer feedback process and are difficult and even resistant to involve or inform. This can lead to erratic decision-making canceling projects then months later restarting them as competitors did it, people working on the same thing but in nuanced different ways.
* CVPs really are neglecting areas where the Microsoft brand is strong, in favor of ""red ocean"" areas where Microsoft could succeed but would face tremendous friction.
* Microsoft is moving to a culture of layoffs where they are not based on performance or any meaningful metric often eliminating people who are incredibly talented devoted and loyal over people who really are stagnant.
* PM leadership continuously fails to define a strategy in any meaningful way to help organize IC teams."
Senior data center technician,4.0,"Aug 10, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, leaves a bit to be desired when compared to other big tech, but in general quite solid. Culture is generally great, benefits are fantastic. Lots of opportunities for growth. Having Microsoft on your resume is obviously a huge plus. Tons of opportunity to work with some incredibly smart, talented people. Management will fight for you on your behalf if you have the right skills and mindset.","Big shift lately towards an Amazon-like performance culture and less trust placed in employees. Lots of bureaucracy that makes it difficult to truly innovate. Pay is not good enough IMO for the second largest company in the world (market cap). Lots of values that are thrown out and sound really good, but in practice -- especially as you move up -- are essentially thrown out the window. Feels like MSFT bought too many GPUs without figuring out how to make it actually profitable, and the employees are paying the price."
Customer success account manager,3.0,"Jul 28, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years",Great benefits.  People take great pride in the work they do.  Microsoft is always at the forefront of technology and innovation.,"The role is seen as at the bottom.  Other roles are promoted more frequently and if you haven’t forged good relationships with those you work with, you’ll find their feedback can severely tarnish your year end review.  You can really learn a lot in this role but it can be difficult to have a career doing this. While there are some that have done so, it’s advisable to leverage the learning opportunities to move into other roles as quickly as you can.  This is also one of the only roles that have you on call 24/7.  They’ll tell you that you don’t have to answer the phone at 1am but if something goes awry and you don’t answer, you own the accountability."
Senior data analyst,1.0,"Aug 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years","Great benefits, great people, great place to learn",They will lay you off in a heartbeat if it makes any level of sense to them. There is no loyalty to employees. I have seen 20+ layoffs with the company in 23 years. I have been laid off twice by them. Be grateful for every day and always keep your resume current and have another plan.
Sr product marketing manager,2.0,"Jul 23, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","Great benefits, amazing people and the chance to work on some of the best products in the industry.","After having my most successful year at Microsoft (Excellent Connect Review, Bonuses and Raises) I was laid off after 15 years with the company. Why? Age (I am over 55), Years in role, (I was having huge impact but, I had not changed roles in over 5 years because I loved what I did and was having impact doing it) and Salary (I was at the top end of the salary). I am glad I left now that meeting 100% of your Connect objectives is now seen as only reaching 80% of them, This means MSFT can hire two people with minimal experience and have them work 60-70 hrs a week for the same cost as me that will be happy to change roles every three years. In short, they drew a line, if you were over the line with age, salary, or years in role, you were gone."
Csam - customer success account manager,3.0,"May 31, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","You might work for one of the most powerful tech companies on Earth, but your clients just want to know:

You're supposed to “drive adoption” of Microsoft tools... with clients who still pay invoices via fax. You’re constantly pushing for “modern collaboration,” while begging someone to accept a Teams meeting instead of sending a meeting invite from Lotus Notes

Partner development manager,4.0,"Jul 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","Most folks I met at Microsoft are great people. Because my team is great and my colleagues are dedicated to customer satisfaction, my job is enjoyable. Benefits are great. In the US, we have access to fantastic resources. Well respected company and gives you skills to thrive elsewhere.","The layoffs have been consistent over the past couple years and it has me in this constant zone of anxiety. I have to keep applying for roles externally just in case and that takes a lot of time. Career growth is very difficult at MS. You have layoffs and many talented people raising their hands for the same role. It’s easy to feel stuck in a job here. It’s all about exposure, your network and the stretch assignments you do outside of your role, to get you known. It can feel exhausting that doing your job isn’t enough. MS doesn’t see the great employees and offer to promote you into a new role, it’s all in your hands. Pay isn’t as good as other tech firms."

- Good benefits","- Leadership makes decisions that are either baffling ignorant or outright malicious (example: investing billions into developing a new campus in India, but also having several waves of layoffs due to insufficient funding)
- HR tends to be intensely passive aggressive when it comes to dealing with issues. They also can be straight up dismissive and uncaring. In my particular case, I had to move to a new state for personal reasons, so I had to notify them when I signed a new lease for my new place so they could notify me of my newly adjusted salary. Instead of the 10 - 15% reduction at worst they promised, they reduced my salary by 18%. Left several HR tickets over the situation and was promptly ignored. Left a bad taste in my mouth."
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Aug 9, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years",I liked the inclusive and supportive environment. There is a lot of synergy within a team where everyone wants everyone else to succeed.,"It's a big organization and not very agile. There is a lot of duplication of effort. There is a lot of ""not my job"" and  ""that's not your job"" when it comes to cross team collaboration."
Sr. ux designer`,1.0,"Jul 19, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years",The actual worker-level people are generally very down to earth and good folk.,Pathetic executives doing mass layoffs amid record profits destroying morale across the board. Worthless AI hype obsession rather than actually making good products.
Data center technician,4.0,"Jul 31, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Work life balance, benefits, and decent culture. Opportunities for growth are there if you have the right personality. Always something new to learn.",Raises/Promotions are hard to come by if you're not visible enough to management. Culture is dependent on which campus you're at. Technically gifted individuals are often overlooked and neglected. Lack of technical roles in the data center. General career paths are management and project management.
Server engineer,3.0,"Aug 13, 2025","Current employee, less than 1 year",Good benefits and co workers are actually nice,Poor management they dont really seem to care much unless its really urgent
Business program manager,3.0,"May 7, 2025",Former employee,"The benefits were incredible. Microsoft covered premiums for medical/dental/vision. They gave thousands in an HSA card. They matched 50% of 401k contributions up to the IRS limits. All told, probably 30k worth of benefits. 
The work was interesting, at least at first. 
Not too much micromanaging.
Excellent severance package.","No job stability. Seemingly at random, groups would get laid off. Might be 10 people this week from a neighboring department. Might be 2000 people next week. My group lasted pretty long, all things considered. Doesn't matter how well your team does, how many projects you complete, your team may be laid off with no warning.
I'm marking DEI as 1 star not due to any personal bad experiences, but rather because they laid off the entire DEI team, so I anticipate things getting worse.
More and more of the work is focused on the AI projects, even when the results of those projects are less than impressive."
Software engineer,4.0,"Jul 30, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","1. Manager at least I meet are very responsible and helpful
2. There are smart, experienced engineer who is still feel passion about tech around
3. A big company where you can work on different tech stacks.","1. Like every big company, politics sometimes influence the long term decision. 
2. Although there are smart, passioned engineer who took responsibility, there are also quite a big portion of engineer who simply do not care and do not interested in 
3. Reward system can be designed better to encourage hard-impactful work people"
Customer success account manager,4.0,"Jul 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","The organization offers a great deal of autonomy, and you're surrounded by colleagues who are genuinely willing to support you. Additionally, the benefits provided are among the most competitive I’ve seen in any U.S.-based career.","Over the past few years, the frequency and handling of organizational changes have raised significant concerns. These changes often appear abrupt and poorly managed, leading to a sense of instability across teams. There is a growing perception that senior leadership may lack a clear understanding of the day-to-day responsibilities of the roles beneath them—or, perhaps more concerning, that this understanding is not prioritized.
This shift has contributed to a culture where employees feel increasingly expendable. What was once a values-driven and people-focused environment now seems to be primarily centered on financial outcomes. Even in times of strong performance, job security feels uncertain, which undermines morale and trust."
Software engineer,1.0,"May 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years",Pay is fine I guess,"Lack of career options, no internal movement options without going through full dehumanizing interview screening again, posts record profit quarter and celebrates by laying off thousands of employees, every mandate and priority only matters if it cuts costs. Gone is any impetus for creating innovative experiences, quality products, and environments that care about people. AI to cut costs and reduce headcounts and eliminate orgs, they don't hire the brightest nor best people, there's no accountability or consequences for LT and execs, they get away with terrible decisions that sink orgs and cost the company billions by scapegoating the teams under them so they get a bigger bonus by closing studios and firing entire teams that only did what those execs directed them to do. They force you to be on-call 24/7 for long periods of time with no support, bridge calls with thousands of random people around the world for hours and hours on end, sleepless nights with your phone ringing off the hook because they're not interested in improving anything, just maintaining status quo and making it cheaper. We stopped fixing anything more than a year ago and just piled on more half-baked ""features"" that makes the business ""happy"" while making every user experience worse, buggier, slower, frustrating and aimless."
Principal customer engineer,4.0,"Jul 2, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years","Pay, benefits, and overall access to products and software. There are some great managers too as well as options to work remote depending on the role. Supportive with moves to other teams.","Like anything Technology, fast paced and competitive. A.I. has changed the landscape with roles and reorganization with recent layoffs in the thousands. Need to be sure to stay sharp on latest trends and notice the writing on the wall or changes will come without notice. Being flexible is key."
Director,4.0,"Jul 31, 2025",Current employee,"Amazing team, great benefits, good pay, good work life balance.","If you do not live in the Seattle area, you will be pretty isolated. Most people are based there and there's no travel budget to meet your team. it gets tiring after a while of being the only one in the team outside of Redmond. Also, you must be in Redmond to advance in your career past a certain level."
Software engineer ii,2.0,"Jul 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","- Good pay/benefits
- Generally good work/life balance for big tech, depending on your manager
- Decently supportive of WFH/hybrid, with no forced RTO","- Changing teams is the same as applying from outside the company, lengthy interview loops and all
- Very deep hierarchies with many middle managers, lots of office politics, reorgs, etc.
- Always a big layoff around the corner
- Even if your manager is good, sometimes company-wide initiatives will hurt you. I lost my job due by an automated process that my manager wasn't even involved in.
- Anti-DEI at this point. Got rid of their whole DEI department, and then fired me and a lot of other trans and disabled people two days after the inauguration this year."
Hrbi analyst,5.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","People are great, work is interesting, work life balance amazing",Depending on leadership could be toxic
Principal program manager,2.0,"Jul 21, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","If you're at the bleeding edge of AI and the supporting technology, it's where the money is. Copilot be damned, Azure OpenAI will be a force.","If you were a part of the 'old guard', the legacy products, you're being cut to bare metal on resources to fund the juggernaut. That includes things like security & privacy efforts, supportability, anything resembling quality of life for employees. We even had a Satya direct tell us anything less than Enterprise customers weren't a priority any longer, it was AI and the Enterprise customers for the foreseeable future."

Great products: office, Azure, Windows

There are teams with the old Bill Gates/Ballmer culture,  that micromanage every detail and can fire/insult you just because of typo in a presentation.
Hiring and layoffs are done with excel spreadsheet."

My first line managers were all amazing and supportive.","- mid level to senior level leadership were out of touch and came off disingenuous
- senior leaders very passive aggressive and “my way or the high way”
- decisions made by senior leaders were questionable and they always paired the picture of “everything is going great keep faith things will pick up” while sales consistently flounder quarter after quarter and the bench continued to grow. 
- Culture: it’s not what it used to be. The culture is shifting for the worse. Lower sentiment towards trust in leaders, no job security regardless if you’re a top performer and fully utilized."
