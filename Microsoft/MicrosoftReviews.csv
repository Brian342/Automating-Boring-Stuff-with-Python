Great products
Stability",Average pay compared to competitors
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jan 28, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade""."
Product manager 2,2.0,"Aug 6, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","A decent salary and benefits, all things considered","The expectation to grow products exponentially, but bureaucracy and lack of autonomy hamper your ability to actually execute on any sort of ambitious vision."
Product manager,4.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","* I constantly felt like there was a steady flow of very talented people, Not only are people brilliant but also open to mutual growth and learning.
* Exceptional cultural patience, especially within the New England management team, where time and space were generously given for individuals to grow and integrate.
* The company’s scale and appetite for calculated risk created abundant opportunities, which I was empowered to pursue and make the most of really making for an awesome career.
* Microsoft has a remarkable ability to hire genuinely kind and caring individuals. I deeply valued and admired the ICs I worked alongside.","* Senior leadership(CVP level) often impedes progress with decisions that feel disconnected from the realities of product development and customer needs. CVPs and above are disjoint from building and customer feedback process and are difficult and even resistant to involve or inform. This can lead to erratic decision-making canceling projects then months later restarting them as competitors did it, people working on the same thing but in nuanced different ways.
* CVPs really are neglecting areas where the Microsoft brand is strong, in favor of ""red ocean"" areas where Microsoft could succeed but would face tremendous friction.
* Microsoft is moving to a culture of layoffs where they are not based on performance or any meaningful metric often eliminating people who are incredibly talented devoted and loyal over people who really are stagnant.
* PM leadership continuously fails to define a strategy in any meaningful way to help organize IC teams."
Senior data center technician,4.0,"Aug 10, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good pay, leaves a bit to be desired when compared to other big tech, but in general quite solid. Culture is generally great, benefits are fantastic. Lots of opportunities for growth. Having Microsoft on your resume is obviously a huge plus. Tons of opportunity to work with some incredibly smart, talented people. Management will fight for you on your behalf if you have the right skills and mindset.","Big shift lately towards an Amazon-like performance culture and less trust placed in employees. Lots of bureaucracy that makes it difficult to truly innovate. Pay is not good enough IMO for the second largest company in the world (market cap). Lots of values that are thrown out and sound really good, but in practice -- especially as you move up -- are essentially thrown out the window. Feels like MSFT bought too many GPUs without figuring out how to make it actually profitable, and the employees are paying the price."
Customer success account manager,3.0,"Jul 28, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years",Great benefits.  People take great pride in the work they do.  Microsoft is always at the forefront of technology and innovation.,"The role is seen as at the bottom.  Other roles are promoted more frequently and if you haven’t forged good relationships with those you work with, you’ll find their feedback can severely tarnish your year end review.  You can really learn a lot in this role but it can be difficult to have a career doing this. While there are some that have done so, it’s advisable to leverage the learning opportunities to move into other roles as quickly as you can.  This is also one of the only roles that have you on call 24/7.  They’ll tell you that you don’t have to answer the phone at 1am but if something goes awry and you don’t answer, you own the accountability."
Senior data analyst,1.0,"Aug 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 10 years","Great benefits, great people, great place to learn",They will lay you off in a heartbeat if it makes any level of sense to them. There is no loyalty to employees. I have seen 20+ layoffs with the company in 23 years. I have been laid off twice by them. Be grateful for every day and always keep your resume current and have another plan.
Sr product marketing manager,2.0,"Jul 23, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","Great benefits, amazing people and the chance to work on some of the best products in the industry.","After having my most successful year at Microsoft (Excellent Connect Review, Bonuses and Raises) I was laid off after 15 years with the company. Why? Age (I am over 55), Years in role, (I was having huge impact but, I had not changed roles in over 5 years because I loved what I did and was having impact doing it) and Salary (I was at the top end of the salary). I am glad I left now that meeting 100% of your Connect objectives is now seen as only reaching 80% of them, This means MSFT can hire two people with minimal experience and have them work 60-70 hrs a week for the same cost as me that will be happy to change roles every three years. In short, they drew a line, if you were over the line with age, salary, or years in role, you were gone."
Csam - customer success account manager,3.0,"May 31, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","You might work for one of the most powerful tech companies on Earth, but your clients just want to know:

You're supposed to “drive adoption” of Microsoft tools... with clients who still pay invoices via fax. You’re constantly pushing for “modern collaboration,” while begging someone to accept a Teams meeting instead of sending a meeting invite from Lotus Notes

Partner development manager,4.0,"Jul 4, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","Most folks I met at Microsoft are great people. Because my team is great and my colleagues are dedicated to customer satisfaction, my job is enjoyable. Benefits are great. In the US, we have access to fantastic resources. Well respected company and gives you skills to thrive elsewhere.","The layoffs have been consistent over the past couple years and it has me in this constant zone of anxiety. I have to keep applying for roles externally just in case and that takes a lot of time. Career growth is very difficult at MS. You have layoffs and many talented people raising their hands for the same role. It’s easy to feel stuck in a job here. It’s all about exposure, your network and the stretch assignments you do outside of your role, to get you known. It can feel exhausting that doing your job isn’t enough. MS doesn’t see the great employees and offer to promote you into a new role, it’s all in your hands. Pay isn’t as good as other tech firms."

- Good benefits","- Leadership makes decisions that are either baffling ignorant or outright malicious (example: investing billions into developing a new campus in India, but also having several waves of layoffs due to insufficient funding)
- HR tends to be intensely passive aggressive when it comes to dealing with issues. They also can be straight up dismissive and uncaring. In my particular case, I had to move to a new state for personal reasons, so I had to notify them when I signed a new lease for my new place so they could notify me of my newly adjusted salary. Instead of the 10 - 15% reduction at worst they promised, they reduced my salary by 18%. Left several HR tickets over the situation and was promptly ignored. Left a bad taste in my mouth."
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Aug 9, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years",I liked the inclusive and supportive environment.

Always something new to learn.",Raises/Promotions are hard to come by if you're not visible enough to management. Culture is dependent on which campus you're at. Technically gifted individuals are often overlooked and neglected. Lack of technical roles in the data center. General career paths are management and project management.

Business program manager,3.0,"May 7, 2025",Former employee,"The benefits were incredible. Microsoft covered premiums for medical/dental/vision. They gave thousands in an HSA card. They matched 50% of 401k contributions up to the IRS limits. All told, probably 30k worth of benefits. 
The work was interesting, at least at first. 
Not too much micromanaging.
Excellent severance package.","No job stability. Seemingly at random, groups would get laid off. Might be 10 people this week from a neighboring department. Might be 2000 people next week. My group lasted pretty long, all things considered. Doesn't matter how well your team does, how many projects you complete, your team may be laid off with no warning.
I'm marking DEI as 1 star not due to any personal bad experiences, but rather because they laid off the entire DEI team, so I anticipate things getting worse.
More and more of the work is focused on the AI projects, even when the results of those projects are less than impressive."

Customer success account manager,4.0,"Jul 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years","The organization offers a great deal of autonomy, and you're surrounded by colleagues who are genuinely willing to support you. Additionally, the benefits provided are among the most competitive I’ve seen in any U.S.-based career.","Over the past few years, the frequency and handling of organizational changes have raised significant concerns. These changes often appear abrupt and poorly managed, leading to a sense of instability across teams. There is a growing perception that senior leadership may lack a clear understanding of the day-to-day responsibilities of the roles beneath them—or, perhaps more concerning, that this understanding is not prioritized.
This shift has contributed to a culture where employees feel increasingly expendable. What was once a values-driven and people-focused environment now seems to be primarily centered on financial outcomes. Even in times of strong performance, job security feels uncertain, which undermines morale and trust."
Software engineer,1.0,"May 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 8 years",Pay is fine I guess,"Lack of career options, no internal movement options without going through full dehumanizing interview screening again, posts record profit quarter and celebrates by laying off thousands of employees, every mandate and priority only matters if it cuts costs. Gone is any impetus for creating innovative experiences, quality products, and environments that care about people. AI to cut costs and reduce headcounts and eliminate orgs, they don't hire the brightest nor best people, there's no accountability or consequences for LT and execs, they get away with terrible decisions that sink orgs and cost the company billions by scapegoating the teams under them so they get a bigger bonus by closing studios and firing entire teams that only did what those execs directed them to do. They force you to be on-call 24/7 for long periods of time with no support, bridge calls with thousands of random people around the world for hours and hours on end, sleepless nights with your phone ringing off the hook because they're not interested in improving anything, just maintaining status quo and making it cheaper. We stopped fixing anything more than a year ago and just piled on more half-baked ""features"" that makes the business ""happy"" while making every user experience worse, buggier, slower, frustrating and aimless."

- Very deep hierarchies with many middle managers, lots of office politics, reorgs, etc.
- Always a big layoff around the corner
- Even if your manager is good, sometimes company-wide initiatives will hurt you. I lost my job due by an automated process that my manager wasn't even involved in.
- Anti-DEI at this point. Got rid of their whole DEI department, and then fired me and a lot of other trans and disabled people two days after the inauguration this year."

Senior software engineer,1.0,"Jul 25, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","* Flexible working time with fully remote option
* Compensation is so-so, Microsoft actually pays the least of the big tech companies (at least as of 2025), if you can get in at another big tech company rather do that since you'd be dealing with a lot of nonsense in any big tech company for the salary you're being paid, make every dollar count.
* Stock compensation can be good as long as the stock price are going up, but it serves as ""golden handcuffs"". If the stock price of Microsoft for whatever reason does not do well it is not worth working here.","* Mountains of red tape, stale documentation and bureaucracy that makes working here as an engineer dreadful experience. There can be days that you spend most of the day just navigating the bureaucracy that has nothing to do with actual engineering.
* There's this concept of ""One Microsoft"" that tries to foster cohesion across teams; this is failing miserably as people are being laid off and teams are increasingly facing higher pressure to deliver on commitments leading to unnecessary push back across team boundaries.
* Your direct manager (and skip level manager) is going to make or break you at this company. If your direct manager is not informed on the engineering side of things or cannot give much guidance regarding engineering processes as a senior/principal engineer, you'd have to pick up the slack for them and potentially do their job. Avoid new (less then 5 years at the company) managers, especially managers that do not learn on the engineering side of things. Try to get into a team with a strong engineering manager that knows what's going on, this will set you up for success. If you end up under a manager that do not know what they're doing (to determine this ask them technical questions and see whether they have at least some level of informed answer) aim to move to another team sooner than later.
* Tied to the previous point, your direct manager can see when you apply for other positions in the company, know that this has the potential to sour the relationship with your manager which can impact your career opportunities at the company.
* Engineers that stay at the company for a long time has to essentially work themselves into positions that are isolated from all the bureaucracy, red tape and potential cross team dependencies (think positions like code modernization that does not have a lot of cross team dependencies besides getting PR approvals)."

There is no path for growth and a lack of vision. The “values” are performative and they use growth mindset as a crutch to continue to cause disruption rather than making strategic decisions. Overall it’s a very “meetings about nothing” culture, everything gets offloaded to vendors and partners so you’re mainly babysitting rather than participating in meaningful work. Microsoft may be printing money, but the amount of waste is unbelievable. And when I talk about waste, it’s not the people, it’s the vendor relationships and frequent pivots.

Having Microsoft on your résumé can open doors to future opportunities, even at higher rates.

As a contractor, you probably won’t receive health insurance, paid vacation, or stock options—those are reserved for full-time employees.

2. Inconsistent hours:
Contract work may not guarantee 40 hours/week consistently, which affects total take-home pay.

3. No paid holidays or sick days:
Unless negotiated, days off are usually unpaid.

4. Limited internal influence:
Contractors may have less say in strategic direction or access to internal resources and systems.

5. Taxes & admin overhead:
You’re likely considered self-employed, so you’ll need to set aside taxes, manage invoicing, and potentially deal with HST if you're in Canada."

Content strategist,3.0,"May 19, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","Generous attention to health and well-being (could be lip service, of course); great food on campus; surface-level promotion of diversity and inclusion (my experience could have been an outlier, being one of two people on my team who didn't belong to the same ethnic group, with the only other employee of a different background having left the team between the time I trained them and my return from parental leave)","Preface - Received my first LITE (MS PIP) after over three years with the company, two weeks before the May 2025 layoffs

-The low performance claim was based mainly on brand new tasks, involving only three weeks of training for tasks on platforms with which I had no familiarity. Furthermore, despite receiving instruction to not include future ongoing/new tasks for this Connects (performance review) season, and training having only begun three weeks before the Connects call took place, these tasks occupied a significant portion of my performance evaluation for this Connects. One of these tasks centered around a tool that I verified via screenshare with the co-worker training me that it was providing incorrect numbers despite correct inputs, something I immediately remedied upon some lengthy troubleshooting but could not have known prior. I was also cited for not updating tags on a handful of content, when I had originally only been instructed to update the tag for one article. I then immediately remedied this once learning the additional tags were necessary, but not before the co-worker who trained me copied our manager on an email laying out these issues rather than addressing me about them first.

-Retroactive reasons given for low performance, counter to evidence: Another reason given for the LITE was allegedly not creating a user feedback synthesis with which I was tasked to create alone – even though I had created it alone, only for management to instruct another co-worker to create a second synthesis to which the whole team would contribute. When I asked, I was given no reason why they were not using my version, nor informed that this had been formally updated into a team effort (which evidently come this Connects season, it had been reverted to only my task again). Notwithstanding, I still contributed most of the content to the synthesis and organized a prototype design to propose a product feature based on the synthesized customer feedback.

-Retroactive reasons for low performance #2: It was claimed that I was taken off of a reports-based role due to “repeated glaring issues”, yet at the time, this was not given as the reason. At the time, I was juggling most of the reports for the team due to time zone, and those who took over from me have experienced similar occasional complaints from our partner team, suggesting issues that had arisen under my watch over an extended period just appeared to be repeated/numerous, as I was carrying most of that effort. Most of these issues involved technical trouble with our content management system which were debilitating enough that we had to migrate platforms, with the others mainly being our partners not wanting our team to conduct such meticulous reviews (despite this having been the review style on which I and others who joined around the same time were trained and having been docked once for allegedly not reviewing one report closely enough upon return from parental leave, I committed even more strongly to thoroughness). Instead, I was told at the time that I was taken off reports, because they needed someone full-time for another initiative. For the past year, I have received wonderful feedback on metrics goals I have achieved with this program. However, after being the only one on the team to not receive a raise or promotion despite only positive Connects/bonuses over three years at the company and seven years of previous industry experience, during our previous Connects season in December 2024, I asked what I could do to improve and was told that I needed more visibility and given a rundown of the role/band's subjective expectation categories - all of which I was able to speak to. To improve impact, I joined another initiative to enhance my existing initiative. The positive feedback received from three different Perspectives (peer reviews) regarding innovation for driving customer success and revenue were ignored and for the most part, this customer success and visibility initiative was discouraged by direct management. 

-Perspectives potentially influenced by management: A co-worker who is a senior on my team but who has never managed or trained me before the past three weeks working on one of these new tasks framed their feedback as if they were my manager, summing up my entire career at Microsoft and claiming I should be much further than I was, despite never having worked with me directly or overseen my tasks prior to the past month. They referenced a tool we have never used in our work together (but that another co-worker in their time zone has which suggests collaboration in writing this critique but was already covered by the other co-worker in their Perspective) and deliverable types we never worked on together. Furthermore, I was called out for “recurring” issues which were actually all unique from each other and stemming from lack of prior awareness (such as being told that required information was in the training video when it wasn’t, and that I made an inconvenient oversight in an email when it turned out the email in question was actually in an entirely different thread sent earlier on). By and large, while mitigating these hiccups are my responsibility and I am always ready to do so, some could not have been avoided until other factors came to light, so they seem to have been used as a paper trail to reflect negligence.

I had suspected that collaboration might have been occurring behind the scenes when the Connect Tool during last Connects season informed me that management had requested me to ask for a Perspective from a teammate with whom I hadn’t worked in two years but who was a principal member of the team, despite my having already requested Perspectives from five different folks. I was ultimately thankful for this peer’s feedback, as it was overall quite constructive and said that I took feedback very well, which countered what my manager’s comments have claimed - even if the feedback was regarding a task on which I no longer worked (hence us not having collaborated for two years). This could have been at the time due to the situation not being as dire as initially expected last Connects season, despite the performance-based layoffs already kicking off at the time. Once again, it would have been more lucrative to just explain that the report reviewing style (the only capacity in which we worked together) had changed rather than sequester me to a narrow role that has evidently minimal visibility.

While I understand that Microsoft is in a tough spot with these performance-driven and RIF layoffs, I wanted to craft this response, following a Connects call that was very rushed and had such poor audio quality from the manager’s side that I had to rely more on reading the comments than conversing and was not able to pose any questions before they had to end the call. I wanted to summarily assure that, despite my layoff, our team goals and my career at Microsoft have meant so much to me, and that, despite taking parental leave, I have remained ever-committed."
Senior software engineer,3.0,"Jun 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","good values in theory, good work life balance (not including on call), good benefits","work is boring, DRI shifts are hell, compensation is below industry average, no comradery/collaboration on team. forcing continued growth every year at the same level is psychologically harmful. it makes you feel like you are never good enough, and the company is just trying to squeeze more out of you all the time."

Discretionary time off was one of the worst things to happen to this company.","Your growth in a job often depends on your team and your relationship with your manager.

Unfortunately, I had a hard time with a manager who wasn’t respectful. They used Discretionary Time Off (DTO) unfairly against me. For example, after I worked an on-call shift, my boss told me I couldn’t take the compensatory day off like others because I had recently taken my birthday off.

It was also hard to get time off approved. Last year, I only managed to take about 10 days off—my birthday and a five-day trip I had planned. I wasn’t even able to take time off for Christmas.

There were times when my manager made me feel embarrassed in front of my team, even though they would later say they “had my back.” When I tried to share feedback, it was brushed aside, and they would talk about their own personal struggles instead. Despite getting poor ratings as a manager, they didn’t seem to make changes to improve.

That said, this experience was only with one manager. My other managers before this were supportive and professional."

However, recently, they've changed how vacations work by leaving it to manager's discretion which has absolutely destroyed the work life balance. Managers will ask for you to plan your vacations 6 months to a year in advance. They'll guilt trip you into not taking a vacation or taking a shorter vacation. They'll tell you how hard they work to discourage you from taking time off.

There are so many stories that both I and other people in my team and org have about these types of manipulation tactics from managers.

The management team is exceptional—highly technical and deeply understanding of the engineering experience within the organization.
The projects here operate at an extraordinary scale—arguably among the largest in the world, easily within the top three by size.
The work involves tackling unprecedented challenges in networking across a diverse range of sub-domains.
There's the opportunity to contribute, albeit somewhat indirectly, to groundbreaking technology initiatives.
Work-life balance is strong; while the team is hardworking and highly skilled, the workload is managed within humane hours.
Competence across the team is notably high. While the organization may not always have a top-tier reputation overall, the level of expertise within the Azure Networking group stands out as exceptionally strong, surpassing much of the broader organization.

For those who are queer or part of other marginalized groups, the environment is inclusive and respectful. It’s a remarkable place to focus on meaningful work without fear of harassment, bullying, or being overlooked—unfortunately, still a rare quality in many workplaces.","Compensation tends to be lower compared to other major tech companies.

Team leader,1.0,"Oct 17, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Had an awesome team, deeply dedicated to their domain of expertise. Loved the work I did with them. 

The pay and benefits were really good comparatively to other companies.

Did I say how awesome the ICs and my team was.... great, kind, humble (most of them anyway)","My new boss was toxic: I was screamed at, humiliated, and gaslit for; 6 months. I dropped 30 pounds from the stress and was throwing up every morning when my boss called threatening my career and livelihood. I was a high performer under my prior boss, the only difference now - the CVP above me that I reported to. They were a terror.

CVP purposefully set out to destroy our team. Cut our team resources to nothing and then demanded we hit the same KPIs/ ""Do more with less"". CVP withheld critical information to make the team look less effective than other parts of their business. Very nasty/intentional -- played a game of favoritism and game of thrones. Very political. 

HR is often weaponized by underperformers - those people then abuse managers through blind survey or filing illegitimate complaints.. No one ever held accountable for filing BS claims - can say nasty things about you and degrade you; while their lawyers try to extort the company for money. Ugly game. HR does nothing to protect front line manager. HR irrelevant and not helpful, only objectives - protect the company and $ -- use a corrupt process. 

Became concerned for my safety and my family's safety as one employee that was mentally unhealthy threatened me personally. 

The most toxic environment imaginable."

While expectations are high, the environment is not overly stressful, and there's a strong focus on productivity rather than just hours worked.","While Microsoft offers many benefits, there are some drawbacks to consider. Being a large corporation, bureaucracy can sometimes slow down decision-making and innovation, especially compared to smaller, more agile companies. Team experiences can vary significantly, and some teams may have higher workloads or on-call rotations that impact work-life balance. Promotions can be competitive, requiring strong visibility and alignment with leadership goals. Additionally, while the company embraces hybrid work, some teams and projects may have more rigid expectations around in-office presence. Lastly, like any big tech company, navigating internal politics can be necessary for career advancement."

Architect,2.0,"Mar 24, 2025","Former employee, more than 10 years",It’s structured and lean to complete.,"Every year there are commitments that do not always align with the specifics of the geography or area hence not achievable no matter how hard you work. The core commitments are defined at the headquarters and cascaded down to each management layer across the organization where additional objectives are added to the core commitment to meet each managements own objectives, In the end review commitments are a bunch of metrics that either impacts negatively the customer or the technology/service. Example, product/service software developers are evaluated by the number broken code issues before releasing a product/service. A common practice is to avoid raising awareness or fix any malfunctioning code until the product/service is released. This practice reduces the chances of a malfunctioning code harming developers evaluation and hence their bonus, that’s why after a release of products, service or technology the fixes patches etc. are always high. Seems like any product, service or technology isn’t ready to be released but the bonus is fulfilled due to the way the developers are evaluated. It’s vicious. If you raise concerns about this, you may end up fired. Remember, Microsoft's business culture and values are more important than employees' personal cultures and values. 
Finally, at Microsoft nowadays, if you are not originally or descended from India, your chances to grow your career there are lower in comparison to Indians."

Swag (rare)",Growth mindset is a lie they try to say. Had a bad review over a year ago and had a followup review 6 months after that and it was positive stating that I addressed everything. I was a high performer on the team and 6 months later (a year after the bad review) I was terminated for performance. My manager had said 2 weeks prior to that I'm on track for a promotion for the year. So I think the higherups did some query to terminate people with LITEs (bad review) within a 3 year range. Growth mindset is a lie. Didn't even get severance when I was doing really well in my role.

Benefits are premium. Best 401k match on the planet. Health benefit of $3,000 to spend on bikes, hiking and fitness gear etc. Beer kegs exist in most project rooms. And there’s no need to advance your skills beyond what you learned in college. They run their hardware orgs like college design projects not like commercial product development companies.","Because top pay and frequent failure go hand in hand, the orgs are political. Many directors, general managers and some of the VPs are more motivated to protect their status and compensation instead of trying to improve the organization. And so the hardware groups fail and lose money. 

The worst is the politics that arise due to leaders protecting themselves. And folks deep down know they are less deserving of accolades and higher pay and bonuses than their peers in other industries. So while they post how amazing hogging out space for a motherboard on an aluminum brick is, they avoid mirrors that will reveal the truth. They are locusts.

And finally, internally it was admitted that the company wants to get rid of all white men over 45. As a hiring manager
I took a class in which the instructor stated that. And recruiters also told me that they were not allowed to present resumes to me of anyone over 50."

Reviews only happen twice a year. I worked there for 2.5 years with ""no budget for raises or promotions"". One or two people in the entire org got promoted once a year. After my first year, there was an internal hiring freeze that kept anyone from even changing teams.

Shortly after my fourth glowing performance review, I was part of the 10k people laid off in spring 2023. Though the announcement was made in January, the layoffs were rolling for months. I was a part of the very last ones, laid off in a group of 12 people by my 5th level skip, to make room for more people to work on their terrible AI. 

Disorganized chaos:

Agile/scrum is industry standard but it still hasn't caught on at Microsoft. If you need structure, clear requirements, etc., make sure that's something the team you're going to join cares about. My org only started doing *quarterly* planning for engineering in late 2022.

I'm back as a contractor now in a different org and it's actually even worse. They don't even do quarterly planning.

Every organization and team have different cultures around planning, expectations, documentation, etc. If you're thinking about joining make sure to talk to your individual manager about it."

The team culture is very supportive, and I’ve had many positive experiences working across departments to solve complex issues. There are great opportunities for career development, and the leadership training has really helped me grow in my role. Work-life balance is also respected, with flexible work hours that help me manage my personal time effectively.","One downside I’ve experienced is the heavy workload, especially when managing high-priority projects. The pace can become overwhelming, particularly when resources are stretched thin. Communication between departments could be improved, as there are times when it feels like information is siloed, slowing down project progress. Some processes can feel unnecessarily bureaucratic, making it difficult to push through decisions quickly. Lastly, the performance expectations can create pressure, especially during project launches, which can make the role feel a bit stressful at times."

Principal software engineer,4.0,"Aug 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 8 years","Working at this company has its share of positives. The work itself is engaging and meaningful, providing a good balance of challenges and learning opportunities. The facilities are top-notch, offering a comfortable and well-equipped environment that makes the daily grind much easier. Perhaps one of the biggest advantages is the freedom to make decisions. Employees are given a lot of autonomy in their roles, which fosters creativity and innovation. This level of trust is rare and makes you feel genuinely valued as part of the team.","However, the company is not without its downsides. The on-call rotations can be extremely frustrating, often feeling like a burden rather than a necessary duty. What's more concerning is that management seems indifferent to this issue, leaving employees to handle the stress on their own. Another major drawback is that many talented individuals are stuck supporting legacy products that seem to be on the brink of collapse. This not only wastes potential but also creates uncertainty about the future. Personal growth is another area where the company falls short. Despite the hard work and contributions, salary hikes are questionable, making it difficult to feel motivated in the long run."
