Business development representative (bdr),5.0,"Nov 2, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","great team, great pay, great offices","Sales team goot toxic, bad management"
Solutions engineer,2.0,"Jun 26, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",New CEO might improve things,Lack of direction and too many managers who do nothing
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Feb 4, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Decent place and great coworkers.,Leadership needs to do more.
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jan 16, 2025",Current employee,Good work place and people,"Hard work, would do again"
Revenue operations analyst,3.0,"Nov 10, 2024","Former employee, less than 1 year",An incredible culture filled with amazing individuals who foster collaboration and creativity.,"The organization has experienced frequent changes in upper management, leading to a lack of stability and direction. This uncertainty is compounded by regular layoffs that create an atmosphere of tension and insecurity among employees."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Sep 17, 2024",Former employee,"There were so many great employees at Bolt, it was a bummer that the product never could find it's market fit. The 4-day work week was amazing.","There was poor communication between sales and eng teams that led us to take on merchants that needed a ton of new features that would be of no use to other merchants. It led to a lot of wasted time and energy, and ultimately money."
People leader,5.0,"Jul 24, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","Bolt has a big vision, bringing frictionless shopping experiences to millions of shoppers worldwide by allowing shoppers to be recognized. The people at Bolt are highly motivated and exceptional to work with.","Bolt is still a startup, and pivots are frequent. We do a lot of experimentation and are aggressively trying to find our way to scale. If this sounds a little too uncomfortable, we may recognize it may not be the best environment for every personality."
Senior recruiter,5.0,"Jul 23, 2024","Current employee, less than 1 year","Interviewing with Bolt consisted of 4-5 conversations with leaders and stakeholders I'd be working alongside on a daily basis/supporting. Interviewers were engaging and it was a very positive experience overall. 

Once hired, onboarding took about 1-2 weeks and was very organized. Had more than enough support in terms of both materials and colleagues to get up to speed on Bolt's product, culture, etc. 
Pay and benefits are strong - company is remote-first, Pay is competitive (at/above industry average), and benefits are in alignment with other tech companies in the space. 

Despite previous re-structures and changes in the organization the last few years, leaders are/have been transparent about the changes, the reasons behind them, and the vision/plan for Bolt moving forward. 

Product is interesting and a disrupter in the e-commerce space. You'll have the opportunity to work on/support the development of a product that supports well known brands everyone knows which is cool. 

There have been changes in leadership recently, and as a new hire, it seems from both a company vision/GTM strategy, as well as an employee morale standpoint, they are for the better. Individual contributors and leaders alike are aligned on the vision for the company and the product moving forward and are making a concerted effort to create a culture of more communication, transparency, and openness within all aspects of the organization. 

Definitely a startup culture where they prioritize hiring individuals who are able to/enjoy working autonomously, are strong culture builders, optimistic, and take ownership and accountability on the work they contribute. While there are more than enough systems/processes put in place, you also will have the opportunity to create processes from scratch or iterate on them. This may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy working in a high growth/scrappy startup environment, you will likely enjoy the type of work you get to do here.","Because of the multiple changes that have been made in the last 6-12 months, there may be some people that may not be aligned with the new vision/strategy of the company or new leadership moving forward. That being said, leadership has made a concerted effort to address this misalignment head on and have candid conversations about the future rather than not addressing people's apprehensions. From everything I've seen, department leaders and the executive team have taken a very humanistic approach to addressing people's concerns, and you can/will be heard and seen as a valued member of the Bolt organization."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Jul 23, 2024",Current employee,"There is a lot of opportunity to roll up your sleeves and take on ownership that influence the strategic direction of the business. Bolt is going through a transformational shift and has great people in place across the board to help drive that. This is a great time to join if you like building, owning your domain, and innovating.","Bolt moves fast, there is no question about it. Often times, moving fast means things break. It's expected in a startup, but sometimes there are pieces to pick up and fix/solve when the company moves so quickly."
Account manager,4.0,"Nov 3, 2024",Current employee,Salary and work environment are great,Lots of overtime and not much vacations
Revenue operations,3.0,"Aug 21, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Great perks for both in office and remote employees 
Smart people with a passion to collaborate with one another","Management was very secretive of process and what was happening. Also, leaders didn't always support their team. Layoffs several times a year."
Software engineer,1.0,"Sep 18, 2024","Former employee, more than 1 year",Compensation is reasonable if you are not in Bay Area,"Not a week goes by without news of some drama about financing or a lawsuit by a customer. Most of the time, we hear about it from public news rather than being transparent internally. Very difficult to focus on work, keep good talent, or even attract customers."
Risk analyst,2.0,"Oct 1, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Flexible hours and decent pay,Upper leadership was unstable. There were may changes made to the team last minute and it can be stressful
Software engineer,1.0,"Nov 26, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Good domain and scale to work on.,No one knows what they are doing at Bolt.
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 18, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco based pay no matter where you're located in the US or Canada. Bolt USED to have a 4-day workweek but that's no longer the case starting in 2024, so I wouldn't be surprised if everyone starts abandoning ship. Huge upside IF everything works out, but it's a massive risk, so you've got to be OK with that.","Bolt has downsized considerably with multiple layoffs within the past two years, and with no more 4-day workweeks, expect to be overworked and stretched very, very thin. Morale is abysmal. Seriously, STAY AWAY."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 18, 2024",Former employee,The managers were really good people.,"The executive leadership team could not be doing a better job at driving this company into the ground. 5 formal rounds of layoffs in 2 years. All female execs were “laid off” at the end of the year. The board is mostly the founders friends who are not experienced in the industry. The only perk, the four day work week, is no longer a benefit. If you asked most employees what the product is they wouldn’t have an answer. Pivoting, refocusing and changing plans occurred at least quarterly. Sales drives product. Sometimes the stores are the customer, sometimes the users are. The reason the company got as big as it did was because of shady user sign up practices. Leadership will not take any responsibility for any of the downturn they directly caused by their incompetence as business leaders. There is continuous news of litigation against the company. Shocked it’s still operating."

There are so many different personalities on the team but everyone is so driven and extremely competent. They are by far the brightest and funniest people I've ever worked with. 
- Even though the company is full of very young and ambitious people, there really isn't a tech bro culture you would see at many other rising startups in the bay area.
- Extremely ownership and autonomy is highly encouraged here. 
- Leadership is highly transparent and you can tell they make it a priority to keep their doors open for any feedback and thoughts.
- Very competitive comp package and benefits. But besides financial incentives, I truly feel taken care of by the company and everyone on the team on a day to day basis.","- The level of autonomy people function with is not for everyone. If you're not a self-starter and an independent thinker, I can imagine it'd feel challenging to get things done.

I've been impressed and more quickly acclimated by a super robust onboarding and all the Culture Meetings too (Firedsides, Affinity Group Events, etc.).
- Am learning about the benefits of Bolt's value of writing over talking. I've been at other startups and this is by far the most organized, the most accountable, the quickest and the most transparent.
- I, even from the interview process, feel like I can be myself here. Bolt encourages uniqueness and celebrating our team (all parts of us), and I'm happy that there's less posturing (that people don't seem fake/political/game-playing at work) and more genuine openness and realness.
- Bolt truly believes in the value of doing right by, and supporting, all the teammates. So far it seems like the company has prioritized various efforts, services and perks to help employees have a better work experience (I'm obviously biased, but I think that's hugely important).","- Bolt is still a startup, and feels like one (for better but also for worse in some cases). I feel confident that the company will keep fine-tuning processes and policies, but everyone who joins will have to bring their proactiveness, creativity and a little patience to the table."

Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 9, 2020","Current employee, less than 1 year","The people! Of all the places I've worked and interviewed at, Bolt rises to the top. The people are driven and intelligent, and are surprisingly very down to earth and eager to get to know new folks. And that's not just within engineering-- everyone across the company is phenomenal and you'll get to know everyone.

There is also a ton of work to be done. Our CEO (Ryan) has a really ambitious vision for Bolt's product, and if you're the type of person that thrives when given a lot of responsibility, Bolt is a great place to be.

The key differentiator for Bolt is the size of the problem we're trying to solve. If realized, the Bolt vision would change the landscape for online retail in a huge way. Not a single one of the other startups I interviewed at felt like a gamechanger in the same way that Bolt could be.

Also the snacks are :fire:","There is definitely a level of uncertainty that you need to be comfortable with. Know that if you're joining a startup, there is risk involved that you wouldn't be taking on if you joined a big company.

From a technical standpoint there isn't as much developer tooling as what you'd find at a big company. That being said, we have some absolutely amazing people working hard to make developer's lives easier and every week there's another improvement. There are also a lot of things about the development process at Bolt that are actually better than what you'd find at a big company, but know that there will be some differences."

- Our culture is genuine, and even though we have some of the smartest people in FinTech working here, there's no egos. People are just excited to drive the needle, which every person has the ability to do!
- Playbooks and processes are either already built out or are in the process of being built out.  This makes scaling a startup way more efficient, and is a big reason we've been able to grow as fast as we have. 
- Autonomy!! You are the CEO of your desk and are expected to deliver. The amount of trust we are given is motivating in itself. 
- We live by our values, and have great values in place.
- Flexible hours to allow a work life balance. If you want to take a workout class midday, you can. 
- On that note, we have the best benefits, including gym, commute, phone, lunch/afternoon coffee, and company happy hours to name a few.","- Not really a con, but we have a self on-boarding process. On one hand, self on-boarding goes WAY faster because you can power through the tasks in a couple days. On the other hand, if you're a visual learner or if you prefer classroom-style tutorials, it will take longer for the information to stick. Just something to keep in mind."

Special projects associate,5.0,"Aug 18, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","I've been working at Bolt for over a year. I can't stress enough about how much I've learned during my time at Bolt. It's been quite the journey, and with each quarter, I continue to work on new projects, iterate, and drive success within Bolt. There are many pros to being here.
I'd say the best thing about Bolt is the collaboration. I work across multiple teams and I love the personal connection and great work relationships I've built. I'd say most of the people I work with are great to work with and genuinely want what's best for Bolt.
I am not one to take vacation or sick days, but my manager always asks about how I’m feeling and how things are going and always recommends time off and taking time for myself. Super appreciative of this and I have taken a few days off, and Bolt strongly recommends absolutely no work during these days which is great. You’re able to really unplug.
Lastly, I’d say that Bolt is a great place to work. If you want to succeed and grow and learn, you are able to. There’s hard work wherever you look, but it’s all worth it. I enjoy my role and the impact of the projects I’m given. I look to continue to learn during my time here.","This is a tough one, I don't think I have explicit cons, especially with my team and role. Coronavirus is definitely a huge con here, as the work-life balance is less concrete."

-They emphasize hiring for culture, but fail to recognize that diversity exists beyond people looking differently or coming from a variety of demographics, but actually encompasses the ability to think differently too. They are at risk of hiring a bunch of people who all think the same way, which sadly kills diversity."
Customer experience,5.0,"Dec 26, 2019","Current employee, more than 1 year","- Smart, collaborative people and an excellent executive leadership team
- Great market opportunity and strong company growth potential
- Anybody at the company can have outsize impact
- Cultural norms and tooling allow for teams and individuals to easily provide feedback (positive & constructive) to one another, and feedback is nearly always given appropriate consideration regardless of who is giving the feedback to whom. 
- Solid pay & benefits compared to companies of similar size and funding","Like many high-growth startups, the environment is fast-paced, change is regular, everybody has a lot on their plate, and some parts of the organization are more mature in their processes and decision-making than others.  

To that end, being successful at Bolt requires you to:

- Be highly thoughtful about what is a priority and what can be accomplished over a specific time frame, and be comfortable saying ""no"" to projects or goals that are unrealistic or not yet a priority.
-  Take time to build foundations, organizing information & data so that team members can make decisions quickly and then disseminate information about those decisions to key stakeholders with high efficiency.

Currently, not every team or every individual makes the time to do the above on a regular basis, which can result in friction between teams and individuals. However, over the course of my time at the company, people have improved in these regards significantly and I have little doubt that we will only get better as time goes on."

These challenges have helped level up my personal and professional persona. Being successful in such a fast paced environment would require an A-list team to lean on for support, and Bolt has no shortage of this. The commitment to employee satisfaction is evident in compensation, attention to health and wellness, unlimited time off to spend with family, and overall excitement towards progression. I am in love with my profession, and can say with confidence that it has been the best career choice for me. The atmosphere allows for the employees to identify an area of improvement and run with their solutions. And each day is filled with exciting new challenges to overcome. The product is constantly leveling up and so are the people who are involved.","It’s easy to sue one to negativity at this stage of growth within an organization.

-The workload can become daunting if you aren't ready to work hard, work smart, and bring your A game. On occasion, your time (in a customer facing role) may be needed outside of a traditional 8-5 schedule, though this is seldom the case.

Technical recruiter,5.0,"Aug 27, 2021",Current employee,"There is a great company culture here at Bolt -- a lot of this stems from our CEO, Ryan Breslow, and his progressive attitude towards hiring and keeping employees happy and productive -- he's even gone so far as to carve out a playbook for other companies to follow

There are a lot of opportunities for growth, ownership, and impact here at Bolt. We are a rapidly growing company that provides employees with autonomy and trust to do our jobs well. 

Leadership is amazing, coming from many large e-comm companies that bring years of relevant experience in the space and are always working to ensure that employees have the tools they need in order to be successful.

Wins here are team-wide with support coming from all members of the company and constantly being shared on different slack channels.",None that I can think of so far. Right now with COVID we aren't doing in-person activities and a majority of employees are fully remote so I am definitely looking forward to meeting everyone in person at an all-hands once COVID situation improves.
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Oct 24, 2018","Current employee, less than 1 year","Bolt is not the place for you if you settle, are okay with complacency, and enjoy the status quo. This is a rapidly growing startup that is changing the way that people do business in the ecommerce space and you just might be lucky enough to join the team. 

You are given ownership and autonomy to make rapid-fire decisions, change how business is done, and drive results. It is not for the faint of heart. My experience at Bolt has been a whirlwind, to say the least, and I mean that in the best way possible. 

The company culture and values are very results and business orientated. The team consists of hands-down the most brilliant people in their respective industries. This combination means that Bolt is looking to make a real impact in the payment/ecommerce space. 

It's growing rapidly as a company and as of such will see a lot of lateral growth. Offices are springing up all over the place and will facilitate that lateral movement in the organization. 

Bolt is awesome.",It depends on what you consider a con. Some people think it's a con when they get brutal feedback from their manager while others are able to thrive off it. Bolt fits into the latter category. You'll work hard and know it. If that's a con-Bolt isn't for you.

Management values the team and pay, perks and career growth are all structured to ensure we are a highly competitive workplace.  The team is strong and many members bring with them experience from leading tech companies (Google, Twitter, Facebook, Uber, AirBnB, etc), payments companies (Adyen, Braintree, Worldpay, Marqeta, etc), consulting firms and universities (Stanford, MIT, CMU, etc.).","We have very ambitious goals and move at a quick pace so you need to be comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty to succeed here.

Software engineer,5.0,"Jan 18, 2018","Current employee, more than 1 year","There are so many things to love about Bolt. I personally think this is one of the best startups to join in all of Bay area.

- Fast paced execution: Bolt iterates really fast. The company is very nimble and the company has a ""get stuff done"" attitude.
- Highly motivated employees: Everyone believes in the company vision and is excited about the opportunity ahead of us. Massive product market fit.
- No corporate structure: People here have decades of experience but everyone is so easy to work with. There is no hierarchy and people just get along so well with each other.
- Very ambitious founders: The company is willing to take risk that many would shy away from. 
- The culture is one of the best things about Bolt. I absolutely love coming into work everyday because of the energy everyone brings to the company. The company is active early in the morning and stays busy till pretty late in the evening.",Bolt moves fast and things change very quickly. Deadlines can be aggressive and things can be volatile. There can be long hours and work on weekends.
Account executive,3.0,"Jun 2, 2022","Current employee, more than 1 year",The people you get the opportunity to work with are incredible. The product is great. The software is great. The benefits are great. The money is decent. Until it is not.,"They clearly have no idea how to run a business. Our CEO is 28 years old and while his ideas might be interesting they are very unrealistic and he is not disrupting the tech space, he is destroying his name and company.

There are several law suits going on around Bolt and for good reason. They are overpricing their product and not delivering. Similar to how they treat their employees. 

They over hired and then fired everyone out of the blue. They kept their cheapest talent and let go of anyone they felt they were ""overpaying"". I was not one of them but I will deff be looking for my next opp as this seems very sketchy. Who knows what will happen next. 

Managers are great but not very experienced managing a team."
Software engineer,5.0,"Apr 3, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","Bolt has a very strong engineering team which means we can move really fast and ship cool products. There is a great emphasis on mentor/mentee relationships so you have a mentor while you are onboarding and then get the opportunity to mentor other new hires. 
We have a big emphasis on writing over talking meaning best ideas win, rather than loud voices. This is especially important in architectural decisions the engineering team makes where a variety of ideas shape the direction of the solution we choose.
The culture of the company is also really strong - there are lots of cross-team events and constant iteration on ensuring that teams are cooperating with each other effectively and efficiently.","In 2019 I felt like we unnecessarily grew too fast which lead to some strain on processes. Since then, we have been more thoughtful about growing teams and it has shown with team culture."
Software engineer,5.0,"Jun 16, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","I've been at Bolt for over a year and I think the one thing I like most is the ownership and freedom to go solve problems. The amount of things I've learned in the last year is crazy compared to my previous roles simply because I was given the chance to try new things and pick up and own various parts of the system.

The company is on a great growth trajectory, so you get to build the core part of the company.","Focus on the company mission takes up a lot of time and there is a lot more work than there are engineers which means that if working on random prototyping of potential features etc is something you want to do, that will have to be on your own time. 

That said there are frequent hackathons and brainstorming sessions to collect these ideas and make sure they aren't lost. Overall its probably good that the company is focussed"

What I can tell you is that ever since a certain manager came in, sales numbers in Salt Lake steadily dropped until their worst month ever.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Feb 3, 2020","Former employee, less than 1 year","- Perks are good - too good to the fact that revenue doesn't support them
- Beautiful offices","- Young founder / COO who really just do not understand how to operate a business
- Metrics for revenue growth are a slim fraction of what other companies report on
- Company manipulates when an employee leaves and announces it on Slack"
Risk analyst,5.0,"Mar 24, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","-Good Benefits: Bolt has the stereotypical Silicon valley benefits package, catered lunches, snacks, company events, etc. The two that I think are really nice are the extremely good healthcare options, the transportation compensation, and the other miscellaneous insurance benefits, like life insurance. There's also a flexible PTO system that people are actually encouraged to use.

-Great Future Outlook: As of the time of writing this review, COVID-19 and the imminent financial recession are very worrying. Bolt's product, future outlook, and current financial situation are all great counters to this. It's great being able to work from home during this time and not be worried about Bolt going out of business. In general I also feel really optimistic about our product's financial viability. 

-Company Culture: While this definitely varies by team, I really enjoy the company atmosphere.  It's definitely relaxed, but people are held to the standards they need to be meeting.

-Great Risk Team: I'm a risk analyst, so this matters most for the purposes of my review. Since I've started, our team has exceeded expectations and goals. It's nice being part of a group that is successful.","-Some Growing Pains: There's definitely been a transitional shift between when I started working here and now. Early on the company was definitely an early stage startup, where as now leadership has shifted to trying to actually be viable and make money and not just rapid expansion. There were some issues along the way, one of which is that our sales and talent teams were restructured. Obviously layoffs are unpleasant, but they seemed necessary for long term success.

-Engineering Focus: Bolt's culture does feel a little to heavily centered around programmers/engineers. It can sometimes feel like they are running the show in terms of resource allocation. From a risk team perspective this means we get a lot less development of our tools and features compared to other areas of the company."
Marketing,5.0,"Sep 10, 2021","Current employee, less than 1 year","Bolt's conscious culture is amazing and the company truly walks the talk. It empowers you to have a big impact when you're at work. And it enables you to truly take care of yourself when you're off. Plus, the company is super fast-paced unlike others who say they are but in reality, move slower than slow.","Not really a con but sometimes the fast pace means you'll get high-priority ad hoc projects send your way that need to be launched within 24 hours without prior notice.

Sales,5.0,"Apr 8, 2020","Current employee, more than 1 year","Bolt has been an excellent company to work for thus far. The management team largely cares about each employee and their individual success. Bolt hires the best of the best in every org and has puts a lot of emphasis on the talent we select. 

The team facilitates all kinds of team-building events from your standard happy hours to ping pong tournaments, and hot wing eating challenges. These events make it easy to meet cross-functional teammates and become tighter knit as a company. 

The product is a unique and has no immediate competition. This makes it exciting to sell and engaging  to watch the progress of our offerings. The sky is the limit with this platform. 

We move quickly and have had to make tough decisions related to specific organizational restructuring. These are things that are never easy but are critical in the calculated growth of the company. These difficult decisions were made thoughtfully and have set up the company for continued success.","Because we are creating a new category and have no direct competition, our product can be a hard concept for retailers to understand initially. This had led to challenges in outbound sales motion and marketing. Because of this, the sales team has seen spotty lead-flow. I would like to see more emphasis put on the marketing and demand generation of our platform/category. 

Over the last year, our addressable market has shrunken due to technical limitations. I'd love to see addressable market grow rather than shrink. That being said, we are continuing to invest in our platform to grow addressable market in a thoughtful way. I am excited to see this come to fruition."

Even from a non-professional standpoint Bolt employees are just genuinely great people.","All the challenges of building an early stage company exist at Bolt - now layer on the uncertainty and risk of creating a new category within eCommerce.

Since then the company has been very thoughtful about growing at a high pace and at the same time managing load across different units."
Marketing,5.0,"Apr 7, 2020",Current employee,"Working at Bolt has truly been one of the most refreshing experiences of my career.
 
Corporations typically provide employees with all of the resources they need but they move extremely slow due to enormous amounts of red-tape; startups on the other hand typically have limited resources and almost no red-tape, so they are able to move very fast. 

Bolt is the best of both worlds -- we have all of the resources we could ever need and none of the red-tape that slows things down. We are encouraged to pursue 10x improvements, to take risks and try new things. When they don't go as planned, we reflect on the learnings, get back up as a team and try again. 

I often find myself working alongside some of the most intelligent and driven individuals, I've ever met. I'm continuously amazed at all of the things we are able to accomplish in accelerated timelines. From new feature launches and integrations, to landing page builds, webinars and new candidate recruiting everything moves at light speed. 

We’ve all heard the expression that “when you do something you love, you’ll never work a day in your life” — I never thought that this could actually happen, but I can honestly say it’s true. I often find myself coming home late at night with more energy and enthusiasm than I’ve ever felt before. The people at Bolt have become my friends and my mentors.

I am beyond excited to see where we can go from here as a team!","Bolt is a place that rewards the bold, the hardworking and those who take risks. It is a place where top-performers thrive and surpass all of their operational expectations. People have the ability to learn more at Bolt in one month, than a year at a traditional organization. 

Bolt is not the place for those who want to just float-by and give the minimum effort. Bolt is not the place for those who blame others for their failures or those who claim successes as their own. 

Bolt is the place for hard-working individuals who go the extra mile, celebrate their wins and their losses and have the desire to grow — both personally and professionally."

Company Benefits: Bolt has tons of great benefits like 100% covered health insurance premiums, commuter benefits, health and wellness stipends, catered lunches, team outings, flexible PTO, etc.

Future: Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Bolt has recently moved to a WFH policy until it is 100% safe to go back into office. Even then, Bolt still expects the same amount of work output in order to exceed our clients expectations. We strive for perfection and will 'do whatever it takes' to enhance our customers' overall experience.

- There are some awesome, smart and capable ICs to work with","- Exec has shown me a masterclass time and time again of how to set terrible goals, welcome little to no feedback, and how to be pro micromanagers. And of course when we miss these ""goal(s)"", exec doesn't hold themselves accountable and finds an appropriate person/ people/ function to be thrown under the bus, and then they repeat the process, sprinkle in a few more layoffs etc.
- The culture that Bolt is supposed to embody, like ""Founder Mentality"" is a lie. You aren't encouraged at all to act like its your company and you are taught fairly quickly not to question things because the response you get from senior leadership/ exec is quite uninviting and autocratic.
- Since the President joined, Bolt has bred a lot of ""yes"" people (refer to the bullet above as one culprit for this) and it's creates unhealthy tension between teams and mediocre work.
- No career growth opportunities, growth plans aren't a thing here, and people tend to fail up and get promoted into senior leadership, which is comical."
