Solutions engineer,2.0,"Jun 26, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",New CEO might improve things,Lack of direction and too many managers who do nothing
Senior software engineer,4.0,"Feb 4, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year",Decent place and great coworkers.,Leadership needs to do more.
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jan 16, 2025",Current employee,Good work place and people,"Hard work, would do again"
Revenue operations analyst,3.0,"Nov 10, 2024","Former employee, less than 1 year",An incredible culture filled with amazing individuals who foster collaboration and creativity.,"The organization has experienced frequent changes in upper management, leading to a lack of stability and direction. This uncertainty is compounded by regular layoffs that create an atmosphere of tension and insecurity among employees."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Sep 17, 2024",Former employee,"There were so many great employees at Bolt, it was a bummer that the product never could find it's market fit. The 4-day work week was amazing.","There was poor communication between sales and eng teams that led us to take on merchants that needed a ton of new features that would be of no use to other merchants. It led to a lot of wasted time and energy, and ultimately money."
People leader,5.0,"Jul 24, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","Bolt has a big vision, bringing frictionless shopping experiences to millions of shoppers worldwide by allowing shoppers to be recognized. The people at Bolt are highly motivated and exceptional to work with.","Bolt is still a startup, and pivots are frequent. We do a lot of experimentation and are aggressively trying to find our way to scale. If this sounds a little too uncomfortable, we may recognize it may not be the best environment for every personality."
Senior recruiter,5.0,"Jul 23, 2024","Current employee, less than 1 year","Interviewing with Bolt consisted of 4-5 conversations with leaders and stakeholders I'd be working alongside on a daily basis/supporting. Interviewers were engaging and it was a very positive experience overall. 

Once hired, onboarding took about 1-2 weeks and was very organized. Had more than enough support in terms of both materials and colleagues to get up to speed on Bolt's product, culture, etc. 
Pay and benefits are strong - company is remote-first, Pay is competitive (at/above industry average), and benefits are in alignment with other tech companies in the space. 

Despite previous re-structures and changes in the organization the last few years, leaders are/have been transparent about the changes, the reasons behind them, and the vision/plan for Bolt moving forward. 

Product is interesting and a disrupter in the e-commerce space. You'll have the opportunity to work on/support the development of a product that supports well known brands everyone knows which is cool. 

There have been changes in leadership recently, and as a new hire, it seems from both a company vision/GTM strategy, as well as an employee morale standpoint, they are for the better. Individual contributors and leaders alike are aligned on the vision for the company and the product moving forward and are making a concerted effort to create a culture of more communication, transparency, and openness within all aspects of the organization. 

Definitely a startup culture where they prioritize hiring individuals who are able to/enjoy working autonomously, are strong culture builders, optimistic, and take ownership and accountability on the work they contribute. While there are more than enough systems/processes put in place, you also will have the opportunity to create processes from scratch or iterate on them. This may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy working in a high growth/scrappy startup environment, you will likely enjoy the type of work you get to do here.","Because of the multiple changes that have been made in the last 6-12 months, there may be some people that may not be aligned with the new vision/strategy of the company or new leadership moving forward. That being said, leadership has made a concerted effort to address this misalignment head on and have candid conversations about the future rather than not addressing people's apprehensions. From everything I've seen, department leaders and the executive team have taken a very humanistic approach to addressing people's concerns, and you can/will be heard and seen as a valued member of the Bolt organization."
Anonymous employee,5.0,"Jul 23, 2024",Current employee,"There is a lot of opportunity to roll up your sleeves and take on ownership that influence the strategic direction of the business. Bolt is going through a transformational shift and has great people in place across the board to help drive that. This is a great time to join if you like building, owning your domain, and innovating.","Bolt moves fast, there is no question about it. Often times, moving fast means things break. It's expected in a startup, but sometimes there are pieces to pick up and fix/solve when the company moves so quickly."
Account manager,4.0,"Nov 3, 2024",Current employee,Salary and work environment are great,Lots of overtime and not much vacations
Revenue operations,3.0,"Aug 21, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Great perks for both in office and remote employees 
Smart people with a passion to collaborate with one another","Management was very secretive of process and what was happening. Also, leaders didn't always support their team. Layoffs several times a year."
Software engineer,1.0,"Sep 18, 2024","Former employee, more than 1 year",Compensation is reasonable if you are not in Bay Area,"Not a week goes by without news of some drama about financing or a lawsuit by a customer. Most of the time, we hear about it from public news rather than being transparent internally. Very difficult to focus on work, keep good talent, or even attract customers."
Risk analyst,2.0,"Oct 1, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Flexible hours and decent pay,Upper leadership was unstable. There were may changes made to the team last minute and it can be stressful
Software engineer,1.0,"Nov 26, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year",Good domain and scale to work on.,No one knows what they are doing at Bolt.
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 18, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","San Francisco based pay no matter where you're located in the US or Canada. Bolt USED to have a 4-day workweek but that's no longer the case starting in 2024, so I wouldn't be surprised if everyone starts abandoning ship. Huge upside IF everything works out, but it's a massive risk, so you've got to be OK with that.","Bolt has downsized considerably with multiple layoffs within the past two years, and with no more 4-day workweeks, expect to be overworked and stretched very, very thin. Morale is abysmal. Seriously, STAY AWAY."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jan 18, 2024",Former employee,The managers were really good people.,"The executive leadership team could not be doing a better job at driving this company into the ground. 5 formal rounds of layoffs in 2 years. All female execs were “laid off” at the end of the year. The board is mostly the founders friends who are not experienced in the industry. The only perk, the four day work week, is no longer a benefit. If you asked most employees what the product is they wouldn’t have an answer. Pivoting, refocusing and changing plans occurred at least quarterly. Sales drives product. Sometimes the stores are the customer, sometimes the users are. The reason the company got as big as it did was because of shady user sign up practices. Leadership will not take any responsibility for any of the downturn they directly caused by their incompetence as business leaders. There is continuous news of litigation against the company. Shocked it’s still operating."
Ops manager,2.0,"Oct 3, 2024",Former employee,Salary is the only one,Everything besides salary is it
Business development,5.0,"Jul 23, 2024","Current employee, less than 1 year","-New CEO with a bold vision 
-Great team
-Opportunity to solve challenging problems and tremendous potential to differentiate and create value in the e-commerce space","-Things can appear to be chaotic at times
-Making progress on focus and alignment"
Partnerships,4.0,"Jul 19, 2024","Current employee, less than 1 year",Ability to revolutionize commerce and drive strategy. Fast paced and strong group of people who are great to work with.,Frequent shifts in strategy to find product market fit
Communications manager,5.0,"Aug 19, 2024","Current employee, more than 3 years","Good cash comp; (finally) some engaged, empathetic leadership","It's been a tough ride with lots of layoffs, executive changes, and challenges"
