Anonymous employee,5.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Empathetic leadership and an inspiring, organization-wide commitment to improvement.","When role boundaries are unclear, you may be required to handle work outside your expertise—an especially daunting prospect when critical issues demand immediate attention."
Advisory engineer,4.0,"Aug 26, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 
1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 

4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come..."
Ibm cloud sales,4.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","I have truly enjoyed my time working at IBM, especially the training opportunities and benefits provided. It’s a company that invests in its employees and offers great development programs.","Recently, I’ve observed some changes in how roles and compensation are handled. Some senior leaders have been reassigned to lower roles, and there have been salary adjustments, including reductions for those with extensive experience. 

For someone motivated by promotion and salary growth, IBM might not currently be the best place, as the company seems to be focusing on hiring younger talent at lower salaries, while experienced employees are experiencing cuts. Nonetheless, IBM remains a respected company with many strengths, but it's important to be aware of these recent changes."
Customer success manager - architect,3.0,"Jun 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years","Exceptional pay and benefits. Great people, great customers.","- Heavy organizational ""tech debt"" drives down efficiency and job satisfaction. 
- Customer Success is not truly customer success - it's an organization created as a reaction to an inability to deploy products from Enterprise License Agreements. The primary mission of CS at IBM is to identify use cases, sponsors, budget, and gain commitment to deploy software from ELAs. Those are PRE-sale activities, not POST-sale CS activities. Just because an ELA was sold does not mean things are actually post-sale. An ELA is just a contract vehicle to buy something in the future, a gift card sold at a discount, all the normal sales activities still need to happen. 
- Sr. team members are being let go in favor of inexpensive, inexperienced new hires."
Application developer 2,4.0,"Jun 11, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Out the gate, IBM educational material teaches you all about how to be an impactful player as part of an active tech business. You will have reviews of updated material on how to conduct business with others professionally. On a monthly basis you'll have access to C-suite thought leadership statements and chats, and I have even participated in chats where the CEO of the company will voice his opinion on the goings on in tech news as it relates to IBM.

The location selected is a location in WV nearby to where I am employed, as my actual location was not selectable among provided Glassdoor options.","IBM is a big business, and sometimes promotion can seem years away from actualizing due to the changing structure of the company in the big tech boom times we are in. As a young player myself, the desire to self-educate and become more productive with practice and experimentation can sometimes compete with the need to deliver products on a team. I think the company makes it hard sometimes to balance the two, and when you have to do both, you have to work a heavy load of hours to accomplish it all."
Progammer,3.0,"Jun 25, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","You will get experience working in multiple fields 

You will build up tech experience as well as soft skills. This is a good place to start if you do not have better offers, right off the college (especially if you are local or you don't have much experience in IT and you want to have a recognizable name on your resume 

Opportunities for training like Udemy business accounts as well as certifications. IBM proper also have a load of training. 

Decent work-life balance if you have a project. 

Hybrid model is good at CIC. Three days are required at office as long as you have a project.","Very hard to get promoted 

The consulting sector is very chaotic at IBM. 

Expectations are not always clear. 

Project Leadership is lacking too often on multiple projects. 

Pays lower than most other IT companies.

Whatever you do, if you work at a CIC at IBM, you have to get off the bench as fast as possible, however you will have to fight for work compared to another company where they will give you work."

Consultant,2.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Decent work life balance
Remote work for consulting (at the moment)","Revenue is being driven by outsourcing labor to india so that leadership can keep their hefty paychecks while the lower class get laid off. IBM consulting consistently posts <2% rev growth per year. This is not a place you want to invest in unless it is your only option.

Early career consultants - stay away."

• Strong learning opportunities through programs like Developer Jumpstart and hands-on complex projects
• Autonomy and trust - no micromanagement, allowing developers to work independently
• Comprehensive development process from research to deployment with proper testing protocols
• Opportunity to work on challenging, mission-critical systems that build strong technical foundations
• Recognition for good work through equity awards and peer appreciation","• Steep learning curve due to heavy reliance on proprietary technologies that aren't transferable
• Poor documentation organization makes problem-solving time-consuming and frustrating
• Limited ability to use modern tools and frameworks due to legacy system constraints
• Difficult to find solutions online since most tech stack is IBM-specific rather than industry-standard
• Fast-paced environment can be overwhelming initially, especially for new developers"

However, my personal experience has exposed significant internal challenges that contradict its outward reputation as a forward-thinking and ethical company. While IBM offers many opportunities, its corporate culture and policies may not align with the ideals it publicly espouses.

Global Expertise: IBM has a wealth of talented professionals and innovative technologies. Working here provides exposure to cutting-edge solutions and opportunities for global collaboration.
Diverse Projects: The scope of projects, especially in fields like AI, cloud computing, and enterprise solutions, is vast and can be intellectually stimulating.
Professional Development: IBM offers certifications, learning resources, and a platform to gain industry-recognized skills.","Workplace Culture: The management style I encountered felt rigid and occasionally dismissive of employee concerns. Policies promoting inclusivity and ethical practices were not reflected in the day-to-day environment.
Discrimination Issues: My experience highlighted a concerning level of marginalization and retaliation. IBM's actions during my tenure did not align with the values of equality
Bureaucracy and Inefficiency: Navigating the company's internal systems often felt like an uphill battle, with layers of red tape slowing progress and undermining innovation.
Ethical Inconsistencies: IBM’s policies on issues like vaccination mandates, etc.
Lack of Support for Employees: Efforts to address genuine workplace concerns, such as abusive management and unfair treatment, were met with resistance or outright dismissal, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued."

Senior software developer,2.0,"Mar 12, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years",Ability to work remote. Friendly co-workers.,Most managers were actively doing things to demoralize workers. Seems that the people most likely to be hired as managers are the coldest and least friendly.  Some were outright rude. Workers were pressured not to take vacations or punished for taking earned vacations! This isn't just my opinion. Several co-workers agreed with me.  Most jobs are being outsourced to India or replaced with AI. The idea that this is a US company is wrong. The vast majority of employees now work in India. There's a token number of workers in the US. Of course they look for any excuse to send your job to India without admitting that's their goal. One high level guy who had around dozens and dozens of managers (and three levels of management) below him happened to be Indian. After I left the company I discovered his work experience consisted solely of being a lecturer without a technical degree for 6 years and then he was somehow promoted high into IBM management and was telling technical people what to do. Curious.
Contract management advisor,4.0,"Jan 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","Brilliant people, excellent lower and mid level management. Cutting edge work. Decent, not great, benefits and salary.","Jim Kavanaugh and his colleagues implementing a nonsensical Return to Office policy, with no waivers or exceptions. This is now cascading to all US based jobs, forcing out thousands of great employees. This is a thinly veiled targeted ""layoff"" of the older and higher paid employees, who are less likely to be able to move to a large metropolitan IBM cost center location, without having to declare a layoff or answer to those pesky EEOC issues. This is implemented even against long time fully home based workers who never had an office to ""return"" to. Employees are given 30 days to decide to move, if they are outside a 50-mile radius of the fewer and fewer IBM offices and then drive to that office at least three times per week. No excuses or exceptions. For a global IT company, this is madness. It's just a masked layoff. It's also bad for business, and that's what is so unusual about this--IBM rarely intentionally shoots itself in the foot at point blank range like this. They are bleeding highly competent talent. For a temporary stock bump? Sad."

Good work life balance, though there is now an unnecessary 3x/week RTO mandate. Pay and benefits are not top tier but are decent enough.

Great opportunities to grow and evolve your role. Managers I've had have all been great too; they care about you as a person and want to help you grow even outside IBM. No shortage of mentors at IBM either.

Leadership is accessible and human (CEO office hours ad All hands with Slack Q&As) and is for the most part transparent. Senior leadership takes feedback seriously and acts on it.

If you can design at IBM, which focuses heavily on enterprise design - you can design for a lot of other things. Good opportunity to take ownership and lead projects from the start. 

Work itself is usually the right level of challenging but doable and I'm always learning. The design org is fairly mature and I don't take the incredible Carbon Design System (and its supporting teams) for granted. 

Overall, an excellent place to start your career as a UX designer if you want some structure and mentors and are ok tackling complex enterprise problems.","Lack of diversity and minority representation in senior leadership, so there are not many to look up to higher up. 

Design work is not the most exciting or relatable to the average designer. You have to enjoy ambiguity and be ok navigating around politics / red tape especially when it comes to talking to actual users, which can be frustrating. We also used to have Design researchers embedded in each team... that is no longer the case :( 

Product management is often not empowered to drive features or lead products based on talking directly to customers; they often hear indirectly from CSMs or sales which means a game of telephone and a lot more ""design a vase"" instead of ""design a way to hold flowers"". Makes good user-centered design harder too. We all  often have to make do with proxy users.

3x/week mandate is unnecessary especially since many cross functional teams aren't co-located anyway.

No annual salary raises due to inflation.

Recently, lack of clear company direction or strategy. Seeing a lot of US layoffs (RA's) and moving design roles to India or Budapest, likely to cut costs, along with RTO. We say we're invested in Cloud and AI but I see key roles getting cut like our very important documentation team, and as a result, usability suffers. For example, we now have various AI related services and teams that are doing similar things but are not talking to each other."

For me, it's a choice of $3,000-$4,000 COBRA costs, which disqualify you from obtaining insurance from me and from obtaining reasonable coverage from Healthcare.gov.

---

Working at IBM as a Full Stack Software Engineer was a valuable and enriching chapter in my professional journey. The company offers a unique blend of enterprise stability with a constant push for innovation, especially in areas like cloud computing, AI, and hybrid technologies.

Team & Culture
IBM fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment. I had the opportunity to work alongside talented engineers, product managers, and designers from diverse backgrounds. The culture encourages continuous learning, knowledge sharing, and creative problem-solving, which made for an engaging work atmosphere.

Projects & Impact
During my time at IBM, I worked on end-to-end development of scalable web applications, contributing to both frontend and backend components. I was involved in designing APIs, implementing user interfaces with modern frameworks like React, and building backend services using Node.js. The projects were challenging yet rewarding, and I appreciated how the work directly impacted clients and internal tools at scale.

Learning & Growth
IBM invests significantly in employee development. I had access to a wide range of internal resources, mentorship opportunities, and certification programs. I enhanced my skills in cloud-native technologies, DevOps practices, and agile methodologies. The experience helped me grow both technically and professionally.

Challenges
Like many large organizations, IBM can sometimes have slower decision-making processes due to its scale and structure. Navigating legacy systems alongside modern stacks posed occasional challenges, but it also provided valuable lessons in system integration and refactoring.

**Overall**  
My experience at IBM was overwhelmingly positive. It was a great place to sharpen my full stack skills, work on meaningful projects, and collaborate with intelligent and driven colleagues. I left with a strong foundation in enterprise software development and a deep appreciation for IBM’s commitment to innovation and excellence.","One of the notable challenges at IBM was navigating the bureaucracy that comes with working at a large, legacy enterprise. Decision-making processes could be slow, with multiple layers of approvals often required even for relatively minor changes. This occasionally hampered agility and made it harder to quickly implement innovative ideas or respond to changing requirements. While there’s a strong emphasis on process and compliance—which is understandable at IBM’s scale—it sometimes created friction for fast-paced development and experimentation."
Director,3.0,"Mar 16, 2025",Former employee,IBM offers competitive pay. It's a very large company and you can work there for 2 decades and still not work for every business unit.  It provides you many options to keep evolving as a business professional.  Stocks have also been doing well which is nice for any restricted stocks awarded (you can make a nice sum of money once they vest).,"It's a hierarchal company and unfortunately is very much about who you know which in turn drives promotion or selection of a highly desirable position.  Layoffs are very much happening across the company and not always public knowledge. Work life balance based on my experience was nonexistent. In order to keep up with the demand expected, and succeed it requires you to work late hours and weekends."

Technology, even if it's on your own time, was cool to see it work in real time","Where it went wrong for me was in selling myself. I am in a role as more a consultant than anything else. I have to bid for a position on projects where I am competing with people all across the country, and maybe even the world for one position. If you think you qualify for something, the only thing I'd recommend you to have for when you apply is a portfolio of your work. I didn't and paid the price. Everything else, as far as promotions and seeing how effective you are, rides on working on projects through IBM's clients."

People are put on PIP for unachievable targets that they know you can't meet. However, they will save their friends and people in management cult. Early career professionals jobs will be saved too, even though they don't perform. High PIP rate and inferior territories are given to African Americans. Nepotism runs rampant.

Associate designer,5.0,"Oct 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","They trusted my skills and experiences outside of my age and Psychology major. They hired me based on conversations and demonstrated work, not just paper facts.

My base salary is currently $9,999 per month at 21 years old; I got an 8% raise beginning of the year. I also get ""incentive pay"" (commission) totaling $20-45k annually on top of that as well as a 401k (no matching), retirement account, dental, vision, and healthcare benefits at very reasonable prices.

My first project was with the Fortune 1 company. I now manage the design aspects for 4 high-profile client accounts a year into my job. I am well supported and not overwhelmed. My manager is EXCELLENT and always preaches and acts on family and health coming first over work. I almost never work overtime. Never weekends or after 5pm on a Friday. It's an incredible job fresh out of college and I am very lucky.","I wish the Band promotion process was easier. They recently automated it so it only recommends you for a Designer promotion if you're performing at 132% of quota I believe, eliminating the previous skills test. That was a bad move, pretty much guaranteeing no Designers get promoted.

Also it's hard being gender non-conforming. We need better LGBT community support, resources, and gender-neutral BATHROOMS."

Over 22+ years I've worked with some great people.,"The days of the ""IBMer"" are over. Over the past year and a half, IBM leaders have gone from being ambivalent to being openly hostile towards employees. They eliminated 401k match, eliminated remote work (including for employees who were remote prior to the pandemic), implemented return to office mandates regardless of job role and team structure, conducted multiple layoffs (including three in 2024 and one so far in 2025), forced relocation to high cost locations with the goal of getting older people with families to quit, eliminated employee-friendly perks and benefits, changed the annual employee assessment program multiple times (and now returned to a forced-rank system where 20% of all employees are required to be identified as low performers), stopped all employee spending (including office supplies, keyboard/mouse, travel, etc. Multiple cases of employees being told by their managers to pay for work-related travel out of their own pockets), annual promotion cycle cancelled for two straight years, and the list goes on.

The 2025 GDP and ESP programs (bonus and annual salary increase) were rigged to skip older employees regardless of their 2024 performance ratings ($0 for both bonus and annual salary increase). This was mandated by senior leadership and is blatant age discrimination (which IBM has been successfully sued for multiple times).

There is an aggressive plan to move a significant portion of jobs to India and other ""low cost"" countries. This is ongoing and is planned to continue for the next three years. It will impact employees in all parts of IBM.

Most people I work with come to work every day feeling fear, anxiety, and depression. For all of us, the question isn't ""if"" but ""when"" we will lose our jobs. And there's nothing anyone can do about it - being a top performer, working extra hours, taking on more projects, etc. do not provide any protection.

Even though I still work at IBM (and have for over 20 years), I can no longer recommend IBM as a place that anyone would wish to work. If you're considering coming here, do yourself a favor and DON'T."

Team members who are good at their jobs are like superheroes without capes. When you're part of a good team that is winning clients and closing deals, you feel on top of the world. The technology verticals at IBM are so cool. They support SO MANY businesses, it's hard to wrap your head around. Lots of travel opportunities if you're it. Generally easy to move into new roles from within the company, but you have to prove that you're capable of the new role. I was promoted often. The pay was awesome. Benefits were great. Honestly, I barely have any complaints. They're a great company which is why so many people dedicate their entire careers at IBM.","Lots of ""reorgs."" If IBM doesn't like how a particular strategy is working out in the short to mid-term, they pivot shamelessly. From a leadership perspective, I respect the decisiveness. From an employee perspective, it can leave you changing clients and having to form new relationships all over again.

Uncompetitive technology, and can only acquire tech these days vs. innovating on its own. A lot of big customers are stuck and can't easily dump IBM for another vendor. The company simply cannot get out of its own way. If you're in Sales, your #1 customer will be IBM, i.e. ""what have you done for me lately"".

I was very productive and enjoyed working with colleagues across the globe.

They claim covering increased insurance premiums to be the same as raises, but they just want the tax deduction. They replace senior staff, claiming the costs are too high, with inexperienced new hires. Contracts that were always profitable are suddenly tagged as loosing money, but the costs are normally associated to internal services with inflated pricing or executives listed to accounts that only bill but do no work. There is no job training meaning quality is significantly impacted. Training is primarily for the new sales idea they are pushing, it does not help your work and any substantial training must be done on your own time as they count sick, vacation, holidays, and training against your billable hours.

Automation sales specialist,5.0,"Mar 25, 2024","Current employee, more than 5 years","IBM's training and mentorship are some of the best in the F500 community, and maybe the tech industry as a whole. The people are reasonable, the workload is fast-paced and interesting, but not at the expense of your health. Pay has become more competitive in recent years, leading folks like me to stay for years, even when courted by higher-growth startups. Overall, there's lots to like about IBM.

The new CEO, Arvind Krishna, also seems to have a good handle on what IBM needs to succeed, and he's steering the ship confidently in the right direction, after many years previously of stagnant growth.","Some of the ""old guard"" at IBM are stubborn, resistant to change and adapt to clients' needs. But those folks are starting to leave the company. Sales quotas occasionally can be quite aggressive, but if you are a nice/reasonable person and visibly show effort/hustle, management can be lenient on performance targets. Targets are also subject to change at a moment's notice.

Also, promotions can be extremely slow, and you have to fight for every new career opportunity. Management won't guide you in your career - that's up to you and you alone."

IBM is known for being at the forefront of technology, investing heavily in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cloud services, and data analytics. Working at IBM offers opportunities to engage with cutting-edge technologies and be part of pioneering projects that shape the future.
2. Global Impact

As one of the largest multinational technology companies, IBM provides employees the chance to work on projects with a global reach, serving some of the biggest organizations worldwide. This offers exposure to diverse challenges, industries, and geographies, allowing for significant professional growth and the ability to contribute to impactful solutions.
3. Learning and Development Opportunities

IBM places a strong emphasis on continuous learning. The company offers numerous professional development programs, certifications, and internal training opportunities. Employees are encouraged to enhance their skills and pursue new areas of expertise, fostering career growth and adaptability in a rapidly evolving tech industry.","One potential downside of working at IBM could be bureaucracy and slow decision-making. As a large, established company with a complex organizational structure, decision-making processes can sometimes be slow, and navigating corporate policies can be challenging. This may hinder agility and innovation at certain levels compared to smaller, more nimble companies or startups."

If you are based in the United States, I would give working at IBM a second thought. Moreover, if you are a more senior level employee I would give pause to working at IBM. The focus on ""THINK"" that dominated IBM for decades is out. Now its all about execution, which is fine, but they don't want higher level employees with critical thinking skills.

- Better than average pay and benefits.
- For me personally, I felt valued on my team and like most people really cared.
- They make it a point to be ethical in everything they do, from the way tech is designed and the way employees and customers are treated. I always appreciated that.
- You get to be a part of a world-leading tech team.
- Lots of opportunities for growth and career movement.","- Probably the same type of stuff as any big tech corporation.
- Tons of meetings.
- Few choices in what tools to use. 
- You'll be on IBM cloud instead of AWS which isn't doing your resume any favors.
- I wasn't a fan of the new pension plan (new in 2024 IBM no longer contributes to your 401k, they do this pension plan thing instead)
- It's nearly impossible for the managers to fire non-contributors ... but the catch is there is a (annual? ) round of layoffs. They call it ""RA"" for resource actions. Which always felt like an arbitrary selection of people. I always thought that was stressful because it didn't matter whether you're doing your job or not. Lousy people stayed and good people got let go every time.
- You could be working on a project for 6 months or more, and executives might decide to scrap the whole thing and you just get absorbed into a new team. 
- Uncertain future if you're into remote work. At the time when I left in early 2024, managers were required to come into the office at least 3x per week. Maybe everyone is required now? If not, I have a feeling everyone will be required to come into the office at some point."

Once they have the client's processes and metrics aligned on required service levels, they begin reducing the dedicated experienced Recruiters who were employed with the Client previously in United States to other IBM Recruiters at oversea locations to reduce their overhead salaries and benefits to improve their profit margins. It wasn't a good experience for me since they promoted that coming over to an IBM RPO you would have opportunity to be reassigned to other client accounts when business and economic situations changes.

Senior software engineer,5.0,"Jun 25, 2024","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM is a place that I love to work because the impact that the things that you get to work on is immeasurable. IBM is so involved in many facets of everyone's everyday life and often gets little to no credit for it. 

The company is constantly innovating and coming up with new ways to be relevant in society. 

In addition to all of that I truly believe that IBM often has my best interest in mind and has and will continue to develop me as a professional.","IBM can make various unpopular decisions internally and externally from time to time. Rarely are we caught in serious scandals but things that are popular today like remote work can be a sore subject. 

Although innovation is sought after that unfortunately comes with a lot of churn and change which some people find unsavory. 

IBM is doing its best to reinvent itself and keep the right people on the bus but sometimes due to other factors those people can be deterred from staying at the company."
Managing consultant,4.0,"Dec 6, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Working at IBM offers the opportunity to be part of a global leader in innovation, engaging with cutting-edge technologies like AI, quantum computing, and cloud solutions. The company fosters professional growth through extensive training programs, internal mobility, and a collaborative culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. With a focus on work-life balance, IBM provides flexible working arrangements and a competitive benefits package, including health coverage, retirement plans, and wellness initiatives. Employees also find fulfillment in contributing to IBM’s sustainability and social responsibility efforts, all while building their careers within an iconic organization renowned for its global presence and commitment to excellence.","While IBM offers many advantages, there are some potential challenges to consider. The company’s size and complexity can sometimes result in bureaucratic processes, making decision-making slower than in smaller, more agile organizations. Additionally, while there are numerous opportunities for career growth, navigating IBM’s vast structure to find the right path can be overwhelming. Some employees may also feel that the emphasis on traditional corporate practices and policies limits flexibility in certain roles. Compensation, while competitive, may not always align with industry benchmarks for similar positions at newer tech companies. Furthermore, the company's focus on innovation means that employees are often expected to stay ahead of rapidly changing technologies, which can feel demanding. Lastly, balancing the global nature of the work with personal time zones and schedules may occasionally pose challenges for employees in international roles."

If you go to work there with the attitude, ""What is somebody going to teach me today?"" you'll meet some incredible technical practitioners. You'll keep them in your professional networks forever. for early career, it'll look great on your resume.","Huge cultural shift over the past 0-5 years where the employee is just a commodity. You are nothing else but a commodity. You can be the hardest worker; you can get great performance reviews. But if you're in the wrong place in this vast company, and your data points turn up positive in an algorithm selecting employees for layoff, you will be hit. No quarter. All cards are stacked against you except if you are college hire to mid career lower salary. As an individual contributor (less if you are a manager, but still happens), you will be eventually laid off. So, employee culture is pretty much hollowed out -- lots of grim faces because of the packed conditions in the office, rolling layoffs, and RTO mandates. So sad, but true. I hope IBM can find its way again and start investing in people by letting them grow a career there again. But the powerful short-term (Q2Q) financial chess game rules at IBM. You'll run into some wonderful people there, tho! The best!"

When I joined, I was told about how good the benefits were, and how IBM was a ""family."" In the past few years, that philosophy has been discarded. Every few months upper management makes sweeping policy changes, with no employee input, that significantly hurt US employees. When employees react en masse with concern, alarm, and constructive feedback, they ignore or gaslight us, or commit the strawman fallacy by mischaracterizing employees' concerns and then dismissing them. For example, in November 2023 (right after the employee engagement survey concluded), the did away with 401k matching, replacing it with a novel financial vehicle called an ""RBA"" with much lower yields, and tried to spin it as a good thing for us. Based on publicly available information, I'm estimating that this will probably save IBM at least $100M over the next decade in US benefits payouts. It also means IBM holds our retirement money, rather than the employee. IBM simply does not care about retaining talent right now -- if you are a senior or well-paid employee in the US, they see you as an expense, and they're showing you the door."

Project manager,1.0,"Dec 10, 2024","Former employee, more than 8 years",IBM experience looks decent on a resume.,"If you value your career, mental health, and want to grow at work do yourself a favor and avoid IBM. The culture is broken, the leadership is inept, and your work-life balance will suffer. There are far better tech companies out there where you can actually learn and grow your skills.

Every decision, no matter how minor, requires endless layers of approvals from people who have no real reason to be involved. This causes endless delays on very simple work, a complete lack of autonomy, and a company wide culture of inefficiency. New ideas are immediately shot down because the company is stuck in the past. We constantly lost talented people to better tech companies because they felt undervalued at IBM. 

Management is a joke. Leaders at IBM are out of touch with the day-to-day operations. Management does not help you grow or guide you to become a better employee. The company is led by people who have clearly forgotten what it means to actually lead – they are more focused on surviving layoffs than innovating or supporting their team members. 

At IBM career development is a joke. The company has no clear path for advancement. If you don't keep jumping around expect to be stuck in the same position for years, doing the same mind-numbing tasks with no hope of getting ahead.

Toxicity runs rampant at IBM. Expect to be constantly overworked and undervalued, with little to no recognition for the effort you put in. If your manager doesn't like you expect to be blocked from meetings and pertinent information until you eventually get laid off. Morale is at an all-time low, most people are looking to leave for another job/opportunity to escape.

In terms of compensation IBM is behind other tech companies. Forget about sign on bonuses, yearly bonuses or pay raises – they are non-existent, or at best, an afterthought. Some IBM orgs offer 2% - 3% pay raise yearly which is not enough to keep up with cost of living. 

Working at a tech company like IBM means you're stuck using outdated tech. The company’s focus is no longer on innovation, but on milking outdated products for as long as possible. Don’t expect to work on anything exciting or new. IBM can’t keep up with the tech landscape and as a result your skills and career will stagnate."

Digital sales transformation leader,3.0,"Oct 25, 2024","Former employee, more than 5 years","The legacy of great innovation still exists within small, siloed pockets of the large, albeit shrinking, company. Furthermore, IBM has a history of employing exceptionally smart and talented individuals. Finally, IBM has been hiring more young talent as a way to not only save money (less expensive staff) but also to build a new cadre of talented IBMers.","IBM, once a dominant force in the tech industry, has experienced a decline in its leadership position over the past few decades. While the company has invested heavily in emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing, its strategic decisions and organizational culture have contributed to its challenges.
IBM's revenue peaked in 2012 at $104.5 billion and has since declined to $61.86 billion in 2023.
IBM has a history of significant layoffs, often targeting experienced and high-performing employees. These layoffs can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and innovation, hindering the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions. In 2023 alone, IBM announced layoffs of around 3,900 employees, with plans for further cuts involving 8,000 roles by automating positions through AI. In 2024, thousands more senior skilled staff were laid off who were in the Band 10 (the highest pay grade before Executive pay bands) pay range in order to reduce expensive, talented employees in an effort to artificially boost the company's profits.
 IBM’s network and firmware are often outdated, with some software no longer supported by vendors. This reliance on aging tech infrastructure, compounded by offshoring, has made it harder for IBM to implement updates or compete effectively on cutting-edge services.
IBM’s commitment to AI and quantum computing, while substantial, has struggled to yield competitive financial returns, partly due to the company’s conservative approaches to AI applications, cost-focused layoffs, and reliance on outdated infrastructure.
Large amounts of technical debt and aging infrastructure prove difficult to connect shared data sources, leading to multiple ""sources of truth"" for data, which degrades the IBMer's ability to be efficient and highly productive.
Finally, while IBM was a pioneer in cloud computing, it was slow to adopt a cloud-first strategy, allowing competitors like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to gain significant market share."

Some employees may feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure.

Limited Work-Life Balance: In certain roles or during demanding projects, employees might find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long working hours and tight deadlines may contribute to this issue.

Bureaucracy: Large organizations often have established bureaucratic processes, which could lead to delays in decision-making and project execution. Navigating through these processes might be cumbersome for some employees.

Limited Managerial Support: Your experience of feeling overworked without sufficient support from management is a common concern in various workplaces. In a large company, communication channels can sometimes be complex, and individual experiences may differ based on teams and managers.

Emphasis on Metrics: Some employees may feel that the company places a strong emphasis on metrics and performance indicators, which could potentially impact the work environment and stress levels.

Limited Flexibility: Depending on the role and team, some employees might find that the company has a more structured and less flexible approach to work arrangements.

Communication Challenges: In a large organization, communication can sometimes be a challenge. Important information might not always be effectively communicated across teams, leading to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity."

Terrible place to work for engineers in general but female engineers specifically. Male colleagues make way more, are offered stock, and sign-on bonuses. When asking for the same, management tells you IBM does not do such things. Which is a complete lie. Spent 8 years working for this company only to find out these things later on and immediately deciding to leave. Worked towards a promotion for 3 years and only was told I should have gotten it 3 years prior when I decided to quit. Save yourself the time. They have no clear goals and are just headed down the drain. Their HR is completely messed up, basically non-existent. Worked there for 8 years and they asked for money back for ""overpayment"" or they would send me to collections. Am looking into a lawyer to deal with the discrimination and terrible behavior."

They really are walking the talk when it comes to how best to provide feedback in a fast-moving, social environment.  While the outside debate rages on about the value of performance management systems, IBM has done something about it, and has spent time listening to employees and incorporating their feedback into the design elements of the new system. No more forced distribution, with multiple touchpoints during the year and a human-scale time horizon around goal-setting and goal attainment.  All around, this is one of the best approaches to performance management that I've seen.",We'll wait to see how well managers can incorporate this.

It's a cold, cold place where the only measure of worth seems to be billable hours. No place for people like us who were paid out of overhead to develop managed services and offer them to the world.

For mature teams (support teams of stable offerings, who'd each in their field 10-25+ years) - forcing a ""low performer"" to meet a quota when there really was no differentiator, was too close to a lie for me.

Empowering Work Environment: IBM encourages a culture of autonomy and responsibility, where employees are empowered to make decisions, innovate, and push the boundaries of technology.
Working at IBM provides opportunities to contribute to high-impact projects, grow professionally, and be part of a dynamic global team.","1. Bureaucracy and Slow Decision-Making
Large Company Structure: As a massive, global organization with over 350,000 employees, IBM can sometimes suffer from slow decision-making processes and bureaucratic hurdles. It can take time to get approvals or push through initiatives, which may frustrate employees looking for agility and speed in their work.
Complex Organizational Layers: The multi-layered hierarchy may make it difficult to implement changes or navigate internal structures.
2. Frequent Restructuring and Layoffs
Ongoing Restructuring: IBM has undergone several rounds of restructuring and realignment in recent years to focus on cloud computing and AI. While this shift is strategic, it has led to frequent layoffs and uncertainty in certain divisions.
Job Security Concerns: Due to these periodic layoffs, employees may feel insecure about their positions, particularly in legacy business units like hardware or traditional IT services.
3. Compensation and Raises
Slow Salary Growth: Some employees report that salary increases and promotions can be slow to materialize, particularly when compared to competitors in the tech industry. Merit-based raises are sometimes modest, despite high performance.
Below-Average Pay in Some Regions: Depending on location and role, IBM's base salary may not always be competitive with other major tech companies, especially for junior or mid-level employees.
4. Work-Life Balance
Long Hours in Some Roles: While IBM does offer remote and flexible work options, some employees, particularly in client-facing or high-pressure roles, report long hours and heavy workloads. The balance between work and personal life can be challenging in certain departments.
Global Teams: Employees working with international teams may have to deal with time zone differences, leading to meetings or tasks outside of standard working hours.
5. Legacy Systems and Technology
Outdated Technology in Certain Areas: Despite its focus on innovation, IBM still has divisions dealing with older, legacy systems and technologies. Working on these systems may not be as exciting or fulfilling for employees looking to engage with cutting-edge projects.
Transition to Cloud: IBM is still in the process of pivoting to become a cloud-first company. Some teams are caught between maintaining legacy systems and transitioning to modern platforms, which can be difficult to navigate.
6. Pace of Innovation
Slow Adoption of New Technologies: In some cases, IBM's size and bureaucracy can slow down the adoption of newer technologies or agile practices, making it harder to keep up with fast-moving trends in the tech industry.
Resistance to Change: Legacy teams or more traditional areas of the company may resist newer, more modern methods of working, such as DevOps or agile practices, which can frustrate employees looking to innovate.
7. Limited Career Advancement
Limited Mobility in Certain Divisions: While IBM offers many training and learning opportunities, some employees report that career advancement can be slow, especially in non-technical or support roles.
Competition for Promotions: Due to the company's size, competition for leadership roles or promotions can be stiff, and upward mobility may be more challenging in saturated areas.
8. Complex Internal Tools and Processes
Complicated Internal Systems: Employees have reported that internal systems (such as HR tools, approval workflows, and internal communication platforms) can be outdated or overly complex, which can hamper productivity.
Inefficient Processes: Navigating IBM’s processes, from project management to performance evaluations, may feel inefficient, especially compared to more streamlined, agile environments in smaller companies.
9. Focus on Legacy Clients
Older Client Base: Some employees may find that much of the company's business still revolves around maintaining legacy clients or contracts, particularly in industries like finance, government, or healthcare. This focus may limit exposure to exciting, new industries or projects.
10. Cultural Divide Across Teams
Varied Experience Based on Department: The culture at IBM can vary significantly from one department or location to another. Employees in newer, cloud-focused divisions might have a more dynamic, innovative environment compared to those in traditional, more bureaucratic areas.
International Differences: Because IBM is a global company, employees may experience cultural and communication differences when collaborating with teams in different countries."

Both leaders realized that the top IT companies in the world had deep in investment in design and UX research. For 7 years or so, IBM was a wonderful place to work. I had a future and I had hope. I worked with great people.","But Ginni failed to increase revenue. 

Arvind Krishna was put in place, a mustachioed little man, Jack Welch's Indian 8th cousin on his mother's side, with a drive to increase revenue at all cost. He got the stock price to record levels. Yay. 

But Arvind has destroyed IBM's culture. The design program was laid waste. Phil Gilbert and even his successor was let go. Now the company is being managed by this visionless egomaniac who has staked IBM's entire future on a sad stack of AI solutions that previously he himself had left on a shelf as irrelevant. He has done all he can to make IBM a dividend stock anyone would want, and he didn't care how many IBmers he'd have to step over to get there. 

IBM is a truly awful place to work now. And the man lies as much as Donald Trump - pretending the endless layoffs he has instituted is to due to ""AI"" - when what that really means is ""All India"" as he relentlessly outsources and American jobs to his home county and lying that it is because of IBM's great AI tech.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 9, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Coworkers were *mostly* nice. Management was kind, if not always competent.
People that don't work at IBM and aren't in the tech industry think it's a prestigious company.","Several coworkers were just outright rude, hostile and almost insufferable to work with. They often seemed angry and bitter and I didn't want to turn into them.
Management seemed detached, disinterested in the job and basically already retired, zero advocacy for me as person or interest in my professional growth and development.
Good work always just brought heap loads more of the same drudgery. Innovation was rejected immediately, ""that's a great idea, and you're right, but IBM will never do that,"" was a common reply. 
Other teams and departments were hard to work with, often not responding in a timely manner and requiring constant hand holding and follow up to get anything done. I got the impression the organization was disintegrating and no one knew what they were doing or wanted to do it anymore.
Arvind was an impersonable jerk that doesn't care about his employees. 
Benefits were not good and getting worse every year.
Salary was bottom of the market and they always wanted me to work on holidays while all the execs were out. Thanksgiving and New Year's especially. 
They only paid agile lip service.
Their tools were the worst things I've ever used in my entire life. I'm sure they were once cutting edge, back in 1988.
Management could often not be reached and refused to commit to more than one or two stand ups a week. 
Often took at least a quarter to get anything done, and more often than it ever should did it take six months to one year. 
They just relentlessly pile work on you. It never ended. Was so glad when I got an offer at a smaller, faster company that paid top of the market and offered better benefits and am able to do more work in less time and on my own time table.
Most of their revenue growth appeared to be just accounting gimmicks. They're just sucking big blue dry of every last drop for their investors and then it'll die off.
Lots of that terrible fake inclusion stuff like having a taco day for Hispanic culture (I'm not even kidding).
Totally incapable of functioning as a remote company, of course they wanted everyone to go back to the office they literally couldn't operate any other way - management might have to actually do their job in a remote setting.
The company is the laughing stock of its peers. The WalMart of tech companies."

I watched directors harrass sales representatives, show favoritism and engage in retaliation and nothing was done about it."

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary.

Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

Spent over 3 years with the company and they provided me and others with no actual projects, just had us changing training topics every week or two, gaining surface level knowledge without any practical experience. All practical experience I gained was doing projects on my own time after work hours because I was simply told ""Learn X on Udemy"" This made it incredibly difficult to speak to ones abilities when finding a new job on top of the dread of opening my laptop every day. On top of walking back their remote work policy and having me go back to spending 2+ hours a day in traffic that I could instead be spending with my family. It never felt like a team environment with everyone stuck on Udemy with their headphones on anyway. Got calls regularly on weekend evenings (8-9 pm)to design and develop features that weren't urgent just because one of the architects didn't have anything else to do and wanted us to work on these features right away and not charge the client for those hours worked.

IBM is the only place I've ever worked where not delivering anything simply doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is creating the >>> appearance <<< of work, by organizing countless meetings and producing massive amounts of paperwork.

I used to love it. Now, for over six months, we're in some unofficial, ambiguous hiring freeze. There was some restructuring going on, and the budget for 2023 was supposed to be announced in February 2023. Then March 2023. It's April 2023 and there is STILL no budget for 2023. Meanwhile, IBM boasts 4,4% growth in revenue, and executives are sending out general e-mails demanding excellence. My team has been understaffed since Q4 2022, and there is ongoing employee turnover - things are expected to worsen. Grandious failure of executives to communicate anything about the budget and plans for 2023. I am unbelievably disappointed in IBM and its management. They pretend that all is well, have the ignorance to demand maximum performance from their employees, but ignore our daily reality. I will not work a minute overtime to compensate for their inability to manage until some form of official communication addresses my concerns. I do not recommend joining IBM at this point in time."

IBM hires many sub-ks or offshore employees for work which leaving employees struggling to find new projects
Teams are fairly silo'd so if you are interested in trying a new industry or role, it's nearly impossible to switch over. They do not like to hire across divisions or ""give people a chance"". Sometimes it seems like you are only doing roles where you have prior experience, so learning and growth can be challenging unless you find a manager willing to give you a new opportunity."

Strategy consultant,4.0,"Oct 12, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year","IBM is a great place to develop. The company plays across the entire tech industry, has a huge consulting arm, and does cutting edge research. It's a steady ship and doesn't tend to get rocked by larger macro events, so it has good job security. The people are great, and it's a very collaborative environment. There are opportunities to switch positions fairly regularly, and as such you can grow your career at IBM. Oh, and the work-life balance is pretty darn great.","The compensation and benefits are not in line with the rest of the tech industry. Promotions are relatively slow, but at regular intervals. Over and above performance is not rewarded below the executive level. So, if you bust your butt more than your coworker, you'll likely still get promoted at the same time.

The Google ""IBM Commissions lawsuits"" for round two. In 30 years in sales, I have never had a company try to screw me out of a very large commission the week after a deal signed. They claimed there had been an administrative error and cancelled my incentive letter, issuing a new one for me to sign that would have cut my commission in half. There was no mistake. I knew the compensation plan my colleagues were on and it was the same as mine. Managers who I thought were friends were spineless and went along with this farce. When I sought legal representation, I was surprised to learn how common this practice was. IBM has a culture that promotes technocrats, not leaders.

Until you find one, just soak all the knowledge that you can, it's offered to you and encouraged. While you are ""on the bench"" (not on a project) and most projects, everyone is extremely flexible. Everyone has a life outside of work and mostly everyone knows that. I think this is a fantastic environment and place to work. I'm proud to be an IBMer.","I can't really think of one. However, I do want to talk about 1 con that I have seen a lot. IBM does require on some projects that you work 45 hours week. There is a reason for this. Remember all of that free education you received, that certification you didn't pay for that will follow you anywhere you go, the paychecks you received during this, when all you have done at this point is cost the company money? This is where you make up for it. Now that you are generating income for IBM, that extra hour a day is your repayment. 1000% Worth it if you ask me.

Is this a pro? Of course not, but glassdoor forces you put something down as a Pro.","Lots of incompetent managers. Management does no real work. They just cook up bad ideas about things they know nothing about. Then makes their team implement their bad ideas. Management is getting rid a lot of US workers and moving these jobs to other countries like India and Mexico to save a buck, while holding on to their own jobs. They threatened their employees to get a vaccine or stop working. They made a vaccine policy based on Joe Biden's unconstitutional mandate. They likely did this due to further reduce employees numbers in the US. IBM lost employees without finding replacements for them. The work gets passed to current employees, and IBM refused to compensate employees for taking on additional work duties. IBM made employees take Diversity & Inclusion training similar to Coca-Cola's training that educated employees ""To Be Less White"" I seen IBM's first hand practices of hiring large amounts of young employees. They called it Vitality Hiring. After the new younger employees got their training from older, more seasoned workers, IBM would have massive amounts of layoffs. Of course, the older higher paid employees get laid off, while the new young employees were safe from the layoff. IBM is a disgraceful company, don't be fooled by their fake reputation of being a honorable company. They are far from it."

While that can be a highly rewarding and build a lot of your professional growth, it also limits the bandwidth I have to dedicate to internal IBM initiatives.

I was a remote employee who never set foot in an IBM office ever, and I have a valid medical exemption. I submitted my medical exemption to comply with their new policy, and they rejected it saying they needed more “proof”. So my doctor of over 15 years wrote out a lengthy explanation of why I’m unable to receive any vaccines & provided his contact info so they could investigate further if they would like, but they still rejected it & put me on notice that I would be terminated if I did not provide proof of Covid vaccine. I tried to talk to someone in HR to try to get an actual human to look at this situation objectively & do the right thing, but I was literally refused any actual human contact with HR. I was only able to email the generic HR inbox & id get a reply from a different person every time. Couldn’t even reply directly to the HR rep that would message back. Could only “reply” to the generic HR email. How is a corporate company who has never had any actual human contact with me allowed to override the medical expertise of a doctor who has treated me for fifteen years?! SHAMEFUL!!"

In my region IBM had had multiple projects cancelled due to poor performance due to understaffing.

I only thank this company for the opportunity to make a decent salary. It helped me a lot.,"Reflecting on my tenure at IBM in 2023 compels me to share the profound challenges that markedly influenced my professional journey. My aim is not to disparage but to candidly outline my experiences, hoping that it might spur constructive dialogue and foster a more favorable environment for future employees.

The work culture I encountered was, regrettably, far from what I had envisioned for a company of IBM's repute. It was a culture that seemed to undervalue diversity and inclusivity, not merely in terms of initiatives but in the fundamental respect for the varied perspectives that each team member brings. This disregard for diversity was a precursor to a broader issue—a palpable lack of collaboration, where projects often succumbed to personal egos rather than converging towards mutual success.

Compounding these issues was the absence of support and mentorship from my direct supervisor. Guidance, encouragement, and constructive feedback are pivotal for any professional's growth, yet these were conspicuously missing. The absence of direction not only hampered my development but also left me feeling isolated within a team, struggling to navigate through the professional challenges without a mentor.

The general lack of support extended across the organization, with human resources seemingly indifferent to the employees' grievances. This lack of engagement from HR further solidified the sense of neglect, making it incredibly challenging to see a pathway for growth or resolution of issues within the company.

Management and HR's inaction towards fostering a supportive and collaborative environment made my experience at IBM in 2023 the most disheartening chapter of my career in the United States. It was a culture steeped in self-interest, overshadowing the collective well-being and the innovative spirit that IBM has historically been known for.

Sharing this experience is not about dwelling on the past but about emphasizing the critical need for a supportive work environment. It underscores the importance of mentorship, respect for diversity, and collaborative spirit—essential for personal growth and organizational success. I hope bringing these issues to light encourages IBM and similar organizations to re-evaluate their culture, ensuring a more inclusive, supportive, and growth-oriented environment for all employees."

This practice not only contributes to client satisfaction and fleeting moments of joy but can occasionally lead to an excess of humor within the company, creating a slightly peculiar atmosphere. However, it is apparent that this is an effort to convey friendliness and openness.","as one delves deeper, it becomes apparent that the higher echelons of management lack experience beyond the company. Their trajectory has been confined within the organization, resulting in promotions to high executive positions without acquiring the market-level skill sets essential for the company's size and type.

Challenges in Career Advancement:

In the initial stages, when the company was smaller, promotions occurred at a rapid pace—four times a year—with minimal criteria. However, with the company's expansion, the influx of experienced professionals working under the old employees, many of whom received higher titles than their skills warranted, has shifted the promotion landscape, making advancements more challenging. with opaque promotion criteria. Individuals in client-facing roles, where client feedback plays a pivotal role in promotions, are typically occupied by long-term employees and mostly who hold high titles, giving them a distinct advantage. This creates a disparity, with dedicated engineers contributing significantly to the actual work, facing challenges in securing promotions. Furthermore, the feedback loop from leaders crucial for promotions seems biased, as leaders are often reluctant to acknowledge those who may outshine them. The emphasis on client feedback, which holds way more value than the leader's evaluation, adds an additional layer of complexity.

Issues in Project Execution:

In the realm of project execution, the initial phase involves selecting the right people for leadership roles for each project. However, if the top leadership lacks the necessary technical skills, they struggle to identify and hire the right leaders for the project. Often, leaders are chosen based on familiarity, connections, or charm, resulting in projects led by individuals with less expertise than their team members. This situation leads to delivering subpar products, attributed to poorly structured projects and demotivated engineers aware that only leaders receive promotions.

Now, I routinely assess an individual's entry date into the company to discern their genuine skill level when interacting with them. However, I've heard that in the past, the company had exceptionally skilled engineers who have since departed—there might still be a few that I have not encountered yet (old team).

Dubious Policies:

The company is inundated with policies, with new ones emerging regularly alongside numerous committees. While having clear policies is beneficial, there is a concern that some are misleading or subject to frequent changes. For instance, the evolution of policies such as ""Responsible PTO"" raises concerns about inconsistency and limitations on employee benefits. The introduction of new policies without clear communication adds to the confusion. Policies that once offered unlimited PTO have transformed into enforced maximums with potential rejections and unpaid leaves.

Employee Challenges:

Noteworthy among the policies is one that heightens job insecurity: termination in two months if the company fails to secure a project for an employee. This creates anxiety among employees, pressuring them to accept engagements regardless of personal preferences or suitability. The consequence is an exodus of experts and experienced professionals seeking stability elsewhere, leaving behind those who couldn't find alternative employment.

In conclusion, there is a disparity between the company's external charm and its internal challenges. Addressing issues related to leadership skills, promotion criteria, and policy consistency is crucial for the organization's long-term health and sustained success. The company's practice of conducting surveys and seeking feedback should be complemented by a genuine commitment to addressing the identified issues."

WFH, 401K w/ 6% match, 3 weeks vacation + 4 personal holidays + 7 days sick time, marriage leave (1 week), maternal/ paternal leave (3 months), miscarriage leave (up to 4 weeks in per year), and many other EAP benefits. IBM is ahead of the game. 3. Diversity and Inclusion are central to the organization, you can find a place at IBM where your culture/ identity is supported and uplifted. ERGs actually host engaging events. 4. Mentorship opportunities are what you make of it! (pro & can be a con) 5. Grow your curiosity with endless training opportunities and certifications!","Big company, if you are not actively building your network and making a deliberate effort to connect with others virtually it is easy to get overlooked. Some leaders you encounter still have old school mentality... you are not a good consultant unless you are putting in 70+ hours building decks/ relationships/ pulling together research. We have lives, families, and hobbies outside of work and it is okay to have busy weeks but busy months and busy years are not sustainable. If you encounter one, be patient, work hard, and move onto the next project. Not all leaders work like this, find another that fits your way of working."

It is nothing more than that. My advice? Leave! Your quality of life and career will improve, drastically. Just ask anyone that took the leap they'll all tell you the very same thing. There are still entire teams that even when on site, work at great distances from each other across vastly different time zones; they are not working together even when in an office - it's a ruse. Those of us that built what used to be idolized as the great IBM of old, is long gone. We built IBM's reputation - not the recent leadership (if you can even confer that on them). Also long gone and buried with Old Man Watson (9-edge, face down as they say) is the company's original mantra - ""Respect for the Individual"" and ""Think"" there is no respect anymore - and these greedy executives don't and can't think; employment is purely transactional and employees became faceless widgets long ago. Current employees are paid just enough but have been loaded with FUD - too scared to leave and ridden by first-line managers that only carry out orders from above after getting their spine-ectomies. Those with skills and value can do far better elsewhere and avoid getting stomach ulcers from living under constant anxiety. The new generation and top talent demand remote work options. My advice to you is this: take a clue - exclude Big Blue from your short list of best places to work, unless you want to work under constant FUD. Don't walk away - run!"

This is good if all you care about is technology but prevents application teams delivering business value and can turn a growing business offering into one that is stalled. When layoffs occur, those selected are rarely chosen based on poor performance. Instead it's typical for a entire location to be shutdown and then the work offshored to a cheaper geo.

Employee pay is frequently sub-par compared to similar roles in competing companies. Executive pay is far too high.

Automation engineer,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year","I'm sorry, but really none at all","I was hired for my second job after working with Python at a previous company. I had just completed the Austin Community College courses in Python and Java.

As soon as I was hired, I was sat at a desk and told to manually test a website. I asked for github access and was denied, even read-access. I asked the PMs to include me in scrums and assign me tickets, the PM never talked to me. Every time I would go to his desk, he would say he was busy, every single time. I had no idea what features the devs were working on. When I tried to ask devs directly, my boss would say I was 'bothering' them. I was told not to talk to the devs ever. I was told I was hired for my 'customer service' abilities and shouldn't expect to code. My boss hadn't added me to any jira boards or introduced me to a single person in development. I brought up to my boss how I was expecting an engineering org to work with QA- that I would be involved in scrum ceremonies where work was ticketed, assigned to a developer, and then tasks assigned to QA for either manual or automation. I was told by my boss to instead just keep testing the same UI over and over ""like driving a car up and down the road, then left and right, then diagnonal"". I was baffled. I also mentioned that I was hired as an automation engineer and my boss told me ""not to worry about that"".

A few months in, the company announced that they were switching to a python test automation project, which is something I had recent experience in. When I asked to work on that, I was told I didn't have a Computer Science degree and didn't have engineering experience, so I was denied.

I tried to bypass management at this point and talk to the engineers on that time. At one point I told someone I was sleeping 4 hours a day because I was required to be in both the 5:15AM standup and the 11:15PM standup by my boss. This standup included a bunch of people in India that I had no idea what relation they had to me and seemed to be working on a different project. I just knew I was mandated to be on the call. I was also taking 9 hours of college credit to prove I was ""good enough"" to code, even though I did have an MIS degree and several years of experience when they hired me. IBM was clear that they only counted Computer Science degrees so I was taking classes that would qualify me for that degree. The person I was talking to about my sleep issues told me 4 hours of sleep is too many, I should only sleep 2 hours a day. I should also mention that IBM's campus was pretty far from where I lived and having to attend both a late night and early morning standup was wearing on me so much that I rented out my condo at a loss of $100 a month to a friend and then got a studio apartment near IBM for the year. During this time period, I had to switch my internet but needed to secure the apartment before AT&T would switch my line over. Once I got the keys to the apartment, I requested to move my internet and was told it would take about 10 business days. My boss told me I needed to get internet 9 days earlier or I'd be fired, even though I'd already escalated the request and was given the earliest date. Keep in mind, I was ONLY moving because of IBM's standups. Not having internet for 9 days would be added to my PIP.

Six months in, I was also told there was a issue in the code bubbling up from customer service. When two people pressed a button in the UI at the same time, there was an API error. I was told that I was directly responsible for fixing this issue. I asked how I could be responsible for a race condition when not only was I not the developer, but I wasn't even given github access and able to see the repo that was causing the issue. I was put on a PIP.

I quit this job the morning and hour I was hired a year later. I was unable to quit earlier because I took a signing bonus that I couldn't afford to pay back before then. I was in a lot of medical debt when I took the job. 

The nature of the work also made it very hard to get another job. I had no idea how to present what I was doing in interviews. Eventually to interview better, I started a github project using my own name and started automating the public facing website. This project never integrated with IBM as a company and was never was looked at by a single person except me, but it was the only experience I was able to get at this job doing the thing they supposedly hired me for.

Also, the benefits are awful. Due to a chronic illness, i usually max out my insurance. IBM's max was 15k so I incurred 15k in medical expenses the year I worked for IBM on top of my previous medical debt."

Application developer,1.0,"Dec 28, 2023","Former employee, less than 1 year","If you are good at sales and/or self-promotion, you might be able to make it at IBM.","I came on board as part of an acquisition. After an initial period of ""this is going to be great!"", it quickly became obvious that IBM had no clue what to do with our people or customers. One by one customers left and people were put on the bench. 

1. At IBM, you are basically on your own for finding work. Perhaps if you come into IBM and work your way up, you can build a network, but coming in through an acquisition, you are basically ignored. 

2. Folks at IBM are constantly begging (and yes, that's an appropriate term) for work, since there's little effort made to make sure people are staffed on projects. Even new hires often go onto the internal Slack groups begging for work before they're put on a PIP and shown the door.

3. There is no recognition of technical skills that I could see--it appeared the only way to get ahead was to get co-workers to write glowing reviews about you. If you worked for an external customer, you were expected to solicit reviews of your work. There is no way to simply do excellent technical work and be recognized without shameless self-promotion.

4. IBM prefers to staff technical resources from cheap overseas labor, so if you're like we were (well-compensated and based in North America), you're out of luck--you're too expensive for anybody to touch you.

5. HR is understaffed, to the point that when I resigned, my resignation got ""lost"" and I continued to get paid. Now I have to go through a mess to return money. It says something about a company when they have an entire elaborate website just for correcting overpayments to employees--there are obviously a lot of mistakes made."

Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 13, 2023","Current employee, more than 8 years","Global Presence and Impact: IBM is a multinational technology company with a vast global presence. Working for IBM can provide you with opportunities to work on projects that have a significant impact on various industries worldwide. Cutting-Edge Technology: IBM has a long history of innovation and research in technology. As a software engineer, you might have the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies, participate in research, and contribute to the development of advanced solutions. Career Growth and Learning: IBM offers various training and development programs for its employees. You'll likely have access to resources for continuous learning, skill enhancement, and opportunities to grow within the company. Diverse Projects and Roles: IBM operates across a wide range of industries, from cloud computing and artificial intelligence to data analytics and cybersecurity. This diversity can provide software engineers with the chance to work on different types of projects and explore various roles. Work-Life Balance: IBM, like many established tech companies, often places emphasis on maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The company might offer flexible working arrangements and support initiatives that prioritize employee well-being.","Bureaucracy and Size: Due to its size and complexity, IBM can sometimes be perceived as having layers of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes might be slower and more convoluted in a large organization. Job Security: Like many corporations, IBM has undergone periods of restructuring and layoffs. Job security can be a concern, especially during challenging economic times or shifts in the company's strategic direction. Innovation Pace: While IBM is known for its history of innovation, some critics argue that the company has faced challenges in keeping up with the fast-paced changes in the tech industry compared to newer, more agile startups. Hierarchy and Advancement: Advancement within a large organization like IBM might require navigating a hierarchical structure. Progression might not always be solely based on merit, and some employees might find it challenging to move up the corporate ladder. Workload and Pressure: Depending on the specific role and project, software engineers at IBM might face high workloads and tight deadlines. Balancing the demands of the job with personal life can be challenging at times"

Or maybe do come and fight the good fight here with those of us trying to change the company by being vocal. Any rebels out there come join this century old company and shake things up. It sure needs it. :-)","IBM is forcing their employees to return to the office while also lying about having actual data to back up their reasons for this decision. IBMers have made it very clear to upper management they want their flexibility to chose how they work, not to be told how to work. The numbers IBM does have, but is denying they exist, is how during the pandemic when everyone was working remotely we produced the most amount of revenue the company has seen in years. Interesting IBM is choosing to omit that. I am not saying for the folks out there that like coming into the office that they should be remote too. No, I am saying IBMers want the freedom of choice to decide which works best for them. Not ""mandating"" us to do exactly what upper management wants. It really is despicable. What is worse, if this company would get its act together, the people who are not in upper management are lovely people and the best co-workers (I guess I do have a pro there).

These are the main point of views that are headaches: - Nothing is centralized, teams around IBM use different tools and processes, is like an anarchy. - Management is not transparent at all (I had the luck to have a manager who was really good, but the others I have... lies and smoke). - If you are in the Research department, probably this doesn't apply, but there are a lof of people hired who doesn't know anything about Agile methodologies, pipelines, DevOps... I have been working with teams that everything was manual. They didn't have anything automated, no version control, no documentation for people once they start in the team, just people ""developing"" without asking themselves ""why I am doing this"" or ""what can I improve"". They don't care about quality or documentation, and this was not a new team. - The CEO use to have some monthly sessions where he explains and answer questions that people ask. Don't let them lay to you, most of the things are lies. The most funny is he answered questions like ""There will be layoffs in IBM?"", he said ""we are not going to do layoffs in the following months"". Well, more than 19.000 were laid off two weeks after. - They bury you in paper and bureaucracy. Once you leave the company expect to receive 100 mails with papers. I recommend to hire a lawyer, because these guys retire the money from your 401k when they shouldn't, and when you reclaim they said you were right, but you have to notice it. Whatever, there are a lot of things that can be improved in IBM. I feel sad that a company like this, that was amazing before, now is like this. Recommendation: if you have other offers, take a look to the Glassdoor reviews (of course), but try to avoid this company. If you plan to retire here, I guess is a good company to do it, but if you plan to learn more and grow, forget about it."

Senior software engineer,1.0,"Aug 13, 2023","Former employee, more than 8 years","Some days you can't get any work done because you're too busy helping others or supporting customers, and that is not punished. Insurance is decent if you spend the extra for the PPO plan. And don't add anyone but yourself to the plan. Never had a problem with remote working. While people near the office were forced back in against their will I was lucky enough to not be anywhere near any offices, so luckily was exempt from this farce of a policy. Understanding of personal and family issues that can arise unexpectedly, and PTO given for everyone often enough to feel like an actual reward. Lots of really good people to work with, as long as they aren't in management.","Oh boy. Pay is abysmal. My new job literally doubled my salary for the exact same job with much less responsibility and much better work/life balance. Management is inept at best, and maliciously incompetent at worst. Skeleton crews are common. Any project that requires 6-8 people to maintain normally will have three people at best, or just one (such as my case). A fetish for having contractors build things and FTEs maintain it afterward, which is literally the worst way to build software, especially when deadlines mean code reviews get tossed in order to deliver on time. Realistic deadlines get scoffed at. Sure Bob, one person can perform major version changes to several systems in a single two week sprint, while also doing support duty and 24/7 on-call for multiple teams around the world. All my coworkers felt ""captive"", and constantly looking for a better job. Sure doesn't help to build teamwork. Upper management is literally leeches patting themselves on the back and giving each other bonuses, even when their department utterly fails at every task. As long as they reduce headcount, they've won. Actual goals are irrelevant. Behind the curve on literally everything technology wise. Do not expect innovation to be rewarded. Sets the standard for ""failing upward"". Promotions are reserved specifically for those who are too incompetent to do their current job, so they can rain incompetence down upon their peers from above. Catering to anti-vaccine idiots. There was a small but loud uproar over vaccine policy, and IBM literally enabled that small but loud group to drown out all discourse with conspiracy theories and easily debunked lies. Luckily the most malicious of them were let go after they got too abusive over work chat, but all of those conspiracy theories should've been shot down as soon as they were reported."

A CIC is an onshore cost center, so they expect you to work same projects as the core consulting practices, but they want to pay you half the salary. You'll be compensated peanuts compared to others doing the exact same job. The only instance that I would recommend the CIC is if you're absolutely desperate for a decent job. Just remember that you'll start off with an unfair salary, you won't get meaningful raises, and promotions are pretty much out of the question despite high performance. Overall, definitely do not overstay at a CIC. In this situation, you should only work for a year to get the experience and move on to another company that will actually value you."

As someone who has been with the company for 12 years, you are well-positioned to speak to the many positives of working for IBM. Here are some potential pros that you could highlight: Opportunities for Growth: IBM is a massive company with a diverse range of business units and functions. This means that there are numerous opportunities for employees to grow their careers, both vertically and horizontally. You yourself have been able to do so, which is a testament to the company's commitment to developing its talent. Access to Cutting-Edge Technology: As a technology company, IBM is at the forefront of many emerging trends and innovations. This means that employees have the opportunity to work with some of the most advanced technology available, which can be both intellectually stimulating and career-enhancing. Competitive Compensation and Benefits: IBM is known for offering its employees competitive compensation and benefits packages. This can include things like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Additionally, the company may offer perks like flexible work arrangements, employee discounts, and tuition reimbursement. Company Culture: IBM places a strong emphasis on values such as diversity, inclusion, and sustainability. This can be appealing to employees who want to work for a company that aligns with their personal values. Additionally, the company fosters a collaborative and team-oriented culture, which can be both supportive and motivating. Global Reach: IBM is a truly global company, with operations in more than 170 countries. This means that employees have the opportunity to work with colleagues from around the world, gaining exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking. Additionally, the company's global reach can provide employees with opportunities to work on projects with international scope and impact. Overall, working for IBM can be a highly rewarding experience, with opportunities for growth, access to cutting-edge technology, competitive compensation and benefits, a strong company culture, and global reach. As someone who has been with the company for over a decade, you are a testament to the many positives of working for IBM.","It's important to recognize that while working for IBM can offer numerous advantages, there may also be some potential drawbacks or challenges. Based on your experience, here are some cons that you could mention: Poor Management: Unfortunately, not all managers are created equal, and some may not be effective at their jobs. As you mentioned, you've worked under 17 managers in your time at IBM, and some of them may have been problematic. This can be especially frustrating if a manager doesn't like you personally, as it can impact your professional growth and advancement. Pressure to Conform: You also mentioned that there can be pressure to be a ""yes man"" and conform to management's expectations. This can be a challenge for employees who want to think independently or challenge the status quo. If the company culture is overly rigid or hierarchical, it can be difficult to thrive if you don't fit into the mold that's expected of you. Performance Expectations: Like many companies, IBM likely has performance expectations that employees are expected to meet. However, if the bar is set too high or the metrics used to evaluate performance are flawed, it can be demotivating or discouraging for employees who are trying to do their best. Large Company Dynamics: IBM is a massive company with many moving parts, which can make it difficult for employees to navigate or feel like they're making an impact. If you're working on a large team or project, it can be easy to feel like a small cog in a big machine. Changing Industry Landscape: As a technology company, IBM is operating in a rapidly-changing industry that can be difficult to keep up with. If the company is slow to adapt to new trends or technologies, it can be frustrating for employees who want to stay on the cutting edge. Overall, while there are certainly benefits to working for IBM, there may also be some challenges or drawbacks to consider. These can include poor management, pressure to conform, high performance expectations, the dynamics of a large company, and a changing industry landscape."

Software developer,1.0,"Jul 19, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year",Initially great promises but it ended in chaos,"As much as I'd like to reminisce about the good times I had at my job, it is essential to provide an honest and candid review for the benefit of others seeking employment opportunities from IBM. My time at this company was quite tumultuous and eventually ended on a sour note. The company initially showed great promise, and I was genuinely excited about the work and the potential for growth. However, as time went on, it became evident that there were deep-rooted issues with the company's leadership. There was a lack of clear direction, poor communication, and a noticeable disconnection between management and the rest of the employees. One major downfall was the company's decision to undergo a restructuring process. While reorganizations can sometimes lead to positive changes, in this case, it only resulted in chaos and confusion. Key roles were eliminated, leading to a considerable loss of talent and expertise. This had a severe impact on the team's productivity and morale. The handling of the restructuring process was unprofessional and lacked transparency. Thousands of employees, including myself, were laid off without any prior warning or proper support during the transition. This abrupt termination left a lasting negative impact on my professional and personal life. They didn’t even give any of us an exit survey when we left. Moreover, the hazardous issues with leadership were not just limited to their decisions during the restructuring. There were instances of favoritism, unequal treatment, and a failure to address concerns raised by employees. The toxic work environment created an atmosphere of fear and distrust, hindering collaboration and creativity. Overall, I cannot in good conscience recommend this company to anyone seeking employment. The combination of the poorly executed restructuring process and the hazardous leadership made for a detrimental work experience along with horrible pay and benefits compared to industry standards. I hope that the company will learn from its mistakes and improve, but I would advise potential employees to approach with caution."

Senior technical staff member,4.0,"Dec 15, 2022","Current employee, more than 1 year","IBM has always had a reputation for attracting and hiring the best. That is evident in all interactions with your peers. They are smart, helpful, and care about solving the problems, more than getting accolades. IBM provides lots of tools for bettering your career and yourself. It has as much of a ""Small Family Company"" feel as is possible, with the local management empowerment, despite its size. Another benefit is that IBM really rewards performance, not pedigree. IBM advances it's employees to titles, roles, and responsibilities commensurate with their abilities, and has similarly limited others with better credentials. Most accept and celebrate this, not begrudge it.","It is a big corporation.. there are global corporate policies (hoops to jump through) from everything from software procurement to annual appraisal, but overall, they are reasonable."

Security engineer,2.0,"Mar 23, 2023",Former employee,Working From Home and not a hassle to take vacation time.,"Non existent managers, shady business practices, no growth, micromanaging, lying to customers. IBM OFTEN had non USA employees working on client accounts that per their contracts stated they only wanted USA based employees to work on. IBM also took the CHEAP route and at least for my team, stopped hiring USA workers. When I was there, I was the LAST USA worker to be hired, for years after my manager only hired NON USA workers when the need was for USA workers based on the client contracts. In the YEARS I worked there in the office, I NEVER saw or met my manager, only heard his voice on the phone. He never visited our office and was out of touch with the realities of what we dealt with. In addition, the workload became so much and the micromanaging so bad that within a year, at least 5 people left our team. Also, the company employs derailing tactics. One of my team members applied to another job within the company, it was going well and he landed the job. Our manager talked to that position's manager and ended up getting my team member removed from moving into that position. Our manager then lied to this team member telling him he would give him a promotion and a raise...yes he got the promotion in title only which included the workload, but NOT the raise in pay. I honestly don't know how IBM (at least the security side) still functions, maybe because of their name and history? It definitely can't be from the terrible time I and many others experienced."

Talent acquisition partner,5.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year","Now I come from an agency environment, so it wouldn't be too difficult to beat my prior working experience. That being said, I am consistently impressed with IBM for the following reasons: 1. Autonomy: IBM managers do not hover over you and micromanage your performance. We instead depend on a lot of internal tools to get and give feedback on performance. Communication with our clients and managers is largely left up to us (with guidance), and the feedback from our managers is what is tantamount in our reviews. 2. Work load balance: gone are the days where I have too many reqs to handle. And because I'm assigned to a particular skill set within a business unit, I am able to hone in on my talent pool and also dig in deep to a skill set to get to know. I'm also able to move around, so the skill sets I am exposed to gets broader and deeper the longer I'm here. 3. Education access: IBMers tend to stick around because of the ability to learn entirely new skills through the robust and large internal education program. If your dream is to do something other than your job down the road, there's plenty of opportunity to learn brand-new skills--even learning to code! It's really up to you as an individual to choose your path within IBM.","1. The lack of bonuses year over year is a killer when trying to recruit candidates from outside IBM. Even with our best year yet for our shareholders, we will not be seeing competitive bonus incentives. 2. Return to office push: can we please just give up on this? I understand that it is a huge change due to real estate that is owned, but employee retention and satisfaction is much higher when we allow folks to work from home. The pressure to return to office is also much higher on the softer (""easier to replace"") skill sets, so this pressure is leveraged against your lower banded positions, where higher banded and more niche skills get much more leeway. 3. Compensation ratings for some cities are just wrong. Austin should not be at a ""national"" market level, given our rising cost of living pushing many employees out of the city center. Although leadership may be paid to live in the city center, your professional banded positions are not paying enough to be able to live close to the office, or to purchase property within the city."

Ux designer,4.0,"Jan 16, 2023",Current employee,"People: My team is mind-bogglingly nice and accepting. Your teammates will accept you, encourage you, and teach you to help you get to where you need to be. (Note this varies from team-to-team, but in general the design studio is filled with very nice people) Work-life balance: You will not be assigned more than 40 hours of work a week. It won't even come close, usually. Last year we had a roadmap that was supposed to be ""substantial work"" and my team finished the entire year in four months. Remote work: I've been able to work from anywhere in the world. Paris, Korea, Canada, and all over the US. Countries are coming out with ""Digital nomad"" visas, where you can extend your stay for a few years, and if you've ever wanted to live abroad while on an American salary, IBM might be the best company to let you to do so. Agency: you'll be trusted with pretty important stuff, and it's not uncommon for one designer to be in charge of an entire product. There are a lot of them at IBM. If you are a really good designer, you'll get a few chances to shine. Stability: I can't imagine anyone at IBM getting laid off, even after our last round of layoffs when the new CEO stepped in and wanted to make a big splash (had nothing to do with the company's performance), and even in this economy where every other tech company is doing layoffs.","Low compensation: below market, with shoddy-to-no benefits. However, given the amount of work you have to do I honestly think the pay is fair. Company brand / image: most companies understand that IBM requires a low amount of work and will put a discount on your years of experience. I've seen a few good designers move to other companies and get down-leveled. They're good designers though, so they get promoted back up pretty fast. Low chance of product success: Again, there are a lot of products at IBM. The strategy is kind of to have a small hand in every area of the market, and that means that a lot of the experiments will fail. Many products require heavy investment, but IBM doesn't like taking risks. Of course, that means they're a very steady company, and in this economy maybe that's also a good thing. Low volume of work: For designers, this means it'll be tough to find good feature work / things in general to write case studies on. When it comes to in-house design work a lot of things will already start to blend together, but when you don't have a lot of things to do to begin with... it's tough. If you end up at IBM early-career my advice is don't cruise, take initiative."

Indeed my management chain requires me to lie to my team:  people I trust and respect.  Lies and  misrepresentation are the IBM family values, particularly for personnel issues and also for business metrics.  That is the biggest downside - you never know when you're getting the straight story.  For example, the PBC system is a ranking system.  A first line manager is told what their ""skew"" has to be - the company advertises that a first line manager can use their own judgment for differentiation between team members, subject to some oversight to ensure equity.  In actual fact managers are told what to do and are required to lie to their team members so that the executives can make their metrics.

It was employee focused, there was a focus on the ""IBM family"" and my colleagues were truly like members of my family. Early in my career, when there were true leaders, there were plenty career growth opportunities. Leadership even approached you with new and challenging opportunities. In addition, there were true advocates and sponsors, supporting you and your development. With programs being cut (Corporate Service Corps, US Open, NY Rangers, Yankees ticket promotions, BlueThanks recognition gifts), benefits were reduced to almost nothing (401K match dropped from 6% to 5%) and you had to count your blessings if you survived the last rounds of RAs (which they still do regardless of what the CEO says in the press).","Hostile reorganization missions are used to end people's careers. For example, if you weren't part of the Marketing & Communications click, you were never accepted as part of the team. I was part of the MCC for two years and never felt welcome. I had an interim manager who was my peer on a Friday and became my ""acting manager"" on a Monday. Her main goal was to find ways I wasn't meeting job role standards, even making up value adds that were never discussed or part of agreed-upon SOWs. I was gaslit for over four months and was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan, where I was NEVER going to meet management's expectations due to the demands for course correction nearly every day. An example of ""valuable feedback"" from my manager was that she reviewed the same sentence for over 30 minutes and asked nonsense questions, as she gaslit me in every conversation. If you wanted my ""seat, "" why weren't you transparent and let me find a different role? Instead, my leadership attacked and tortured me. I LOVED the Friday at 5 pm responses - in which three managers conspired to ensure I never met their milestones, generating hours of work over the weekend, in attempt to save my career. YES - I actually did the work while on the PIP. Looking back, I should have done nothing."

-The pay. I found out with 10+ years of experience I get paid 20K more than a college grad. I got a bonus last year ($1500) and none this year. Pay raise of 5% which wasn't bad as a general statistic but terrible when you look at my base pay. IBM is investing in college grads by trying to pay them more... news flash they leave anyway and then so do your Senior/Lead designers because you pay them an embarrassing amount. You blew your wad on the new shiny toy out of college that bailed 1 year later. Congrats.

-The back end devs are determined to kill the world of good design. We cannot make a wonderful experience and have it be implemented in a reasonable amount of time. By ""reasonable"" I mean small CSS changes take 2 months and CRITICAL features to help us even half way compete with competitors like AWS take a year. It's filled with old dinosaurs developers who think that they can design and we are just worthless people that wear skinny pants.

-Offering Management (OM) is mostly useless. I have met one or two that were amazing at their job, the rest cannot understand what their job actually is. They are not art directors and they are supposed to deliver to us the main goal of what the design is supposed to be based on actual market research.

The experience I had at IBM really launched my professional career, most of my experience before was in unrelated fields.","Over time, management becomes more ""metrics driven"" - which is to say, short sighted.  Oh how many things we did twice because they weren't realistic about the scope of the work, or how it fit strategically.  Perhaps that's because much of the ""boots on the ground"" management has no idea what their underlings do.  Also, those awards and bonuses seem pretty arbitrary when you look at the big picture, seems if your own management isn't strong, your dept will never get their share - no matter how hard they work.

I am allowed to wear my goth getup to the office, we had a coworker start gender transition and someone from HR held a meeting with us to go over how to support our coworker during their transition and avoid any awkward conversations. LOVE IT! - My bosses definitely ask for their bottom lines, but we are encouraged to keep a healthy mental state. My due dates have been pushed without argument if I was having a hard time with my depression. - Lots of vacation days, designated holidays, and sick leave. No overtime to PTO options for my position. Life and health insurance is run of the mill, retirement is nice and we have an option to discuss our retirement investments with a financial management team quarterly for FREE. Daycare assistance, adoption assistance, and wonderful education assistance. - There are documents available to show you just what you need to do for raises, bonuses, and promotions. There is a small amount left to discretion, but you will always have proof to argue your worth. You have the opportunity to switch jobs internally and move from location to location (over years, of course. Not months.) This company is full of opportunity and awesome folks.","- Time zones. You will work on flex time, working a certain amount of hours a week, with whoever you are assigned to work with. Some mornings you will have meetings with offshore teams at 3am, and sometimes you will coordinate deployments at midnight on a Friday. There is usually ample warning, and these terms are kinda negotiable. I have gotten used to quick naps when needed. - Onboarding feels a little silly and lonely. You will be given a LOT of information and then left ALONE for 2 months while you slowly undergo endless onboarding training in addition to your position. I asked for a lot of help, and only got a little. I now mentor folks to try and help alleviate that, but it's rough across most cases."

They will move you around within the company until you find a spot that suits you. They also provide quite good health and retirement plans. There is immanent room for growth and promotion. It is possible to spend an entire life climbing the IBM corporate ladder (and some people obviously do). Additionally, IBM has one of the best learning/training programs I have ever come across. Top industry professionals develop what essentially amount to college-level courses. These courses (available on an enormous range of topics) are available to all employees (though some do require management approval). A self-motivated individual would undoubtedly find IBM to be one of the best places to learn and grow.","The company is very career-centric. This a con because everybody is old. Because IBM is so good at retaining it's employees, departments seem to become very top-heavy (lots of senior employees but relatively few junior employees). This ""oldness"" is especially apparent within the software group where management seems to be clinging to old-school development practices. Do NOT expect a modern culture like at Google. As a dev we have zero perks. There is no free coffee. The walls are barren. There is no food in the building. The entire experience feels sterile and dated."

That's the main reason I've stayed for over a year after being hired as an intern. I have gotten some great projects and exposure right out of college. There's also an insane amount of free internal learning and it is highly encouraged and mandatory in some cases to learn new things on the job. Work-life balance is great. I can work from home many days. The benefits are excellent. I have amazing doctors and the actual insurance companies offer many extra resources to IBM employees. 401k matching is also very ideal, I've saved quite a bit in a very short amount of time. There are also other nice perks like being a preferred employer at apartment complexes where I lived. Overall, you're covered if you're at IBM and in truth, they prepare you for a career in- or outside of the company. All of their certifications are transferable skills.","I still don't have an official title since my projects are all over the place. Unfortunately as an intern hire, I didn't have the flexibility to negotiate my salary or have a say in what position I wanted to be in. As a result, I am extremely underpaid. Also, I was placed in a team full of managers as entry-level, so that means I didn't have the chance to get a real raise. This is an unfortunately situation since I don't think I can get the pay jump I need unless I leave the company and then come back."

Technical sales management,2.0,"Aug 30, 2010",Former employee,"IBM has that aura of being a great place to work.  The near collapse of the company during the 1980's tarnished that image, and experience folks understand the realities of both the luster and the rust.  

In a company of 300,000 I would be foolish to try and depict the overall company ""image"", however with more than seven years of experience in the software sales segment of the business I saw some general (negitive) trends.

In order to reduce operating costs a large percentage of the employees work from home.  Many teams are comprised of staff  scattered around the globe, which makes building work relationship more difficult.  Conversely this structure provides a lot of schedule flexibility.","In looking at any position within IBM one must evaluate whether the position has requirements to exist where ever you are located.  Ongoing cost cutting efforts may well eliminate your position or ship the position offshore (in the long term).  
There are annual efforts to reduce the bottom n% (5-15%) of low performers acrosss the company.  If you are in a team of superstars, the team will loose their assigned percentage - regardless of the impact.
In order to achieve continued growth, the company buys a lot of smaller companies.  If you are working in an area of the business that has been enhanced throough a purchase, you risk being cast aside once the new venture comes on-line."
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"Jun 25, 2017","Former employee, more than 8 years","- In the past there has been a liberal work from home policy. I'm not sure how much longer that will last.

- Terrible or none existent bonuses. 
- Management mostly concerned with how to preserve and progress their careers and has little interest in progressing staff careers. 
- Software engineering organization driven by rigid sales motivated deadlines with little consideration for sound software development practices.  This creates substandard software services that are unmaintainable. But Sales doesn't care and engineering management team is too afraid to push back. 
- Bluemix IS an awful mess and any product or service that has to integrate with it WILL be made worse by having to integrate and adhere to the terrible bureaucracy that exists within it."

There are generations of trust behind you.  Generally speaking, first line managers are pretty good and are kind of in the same boat as regular employees.","Our performance rating system is a ridiculous leftover from when IBM needed to cut the fat.  The fat is all gone, believe me!  In general, this is a hard time for engineers at any company.

IBM recently got rid of alternate travel, which is a well known perk that virtually every other firm in the consulting industry offers. The reasoning was dubious at best and signifies a disconnect between upper management and the consultants with their boots on the ground.

Poor compensation, questionable job security (especially long-term), and an ever-diminishing sense of community contribute to a massive morale epidemic.

Now are the days of over-the-phone performance evaluation with a manager you know only by name, and ""virtual teaming"" with people you will never in your life meet face to face.

While the IBM name looks great on a resume, non-managerial skills are crippling. Ten years of IBM middleware technical experience gives you terrific qualifications. To work for IBM.

Financial raise and bonus pools have dried up in recent years despite recent profit gains.

US-based hires are few and very far between. College recruiting is a memory.

Global resources, while just as pleasant and able as domestic resources, can be stifling at a professional level. The length of conference calls depends entirely on the moderator's ability to wade through accents. Emails and SameTime messages arrive in a variety of languages.

Far more middle management, mandatory training, and conference calls than is efficient."

- Huge mismatch between employee's skills and project placement.  The emphasis is putting lower bands who are cheap labor onto projects that need bodies asap.
- Horrible experience working at the USPS and was required to be on the project for a minimum of a year and most likely two years.  Worked 6 days a week including Sunday mornings on client site at 4am.
- Inability to move from project to project.  I had almost 10 IBMers leave the company during my 9 months on my project because movement to another project was so impossible, and I did the same.

- So many layers of management and bureaucracy. Upper management were often out of touch and developers often felt underappreciated or powerless. 
- Almost never got bonuses and when we did, it was so small I was embarrassed to mention it to friends that worked at other places. There were hardly any incentive to do exceptional or give my all when it'll often go unappreciated. 
- No longer an innovative company for many reasons - one reason being that the innovation often comes because someone wants a promotion not because they're solving a great need in the industry. There is so much process and bureaucracy, there is hardly any inspiration for innovation. There is also little incentive to try something new because you know there will be no reward for it (no bonuses) and it'll be met with so much resistance and process, it's just not worth fighting.

Aggressively software audit driven, which destroys innocent client relationships. Sadly, most all decisions are made by Finance which has too much control over client relationships because they do not understand how to support Sales and Technical teams to support clients. Management/Finance will drive out expensive/experienced people, to replace them with affordable/inexperienced people, including zero IT experience, no Computer Science degree, no white collar experience, in a technology company. Why? Because IBM overpaid $38B for Redhat and thus, cuts are everywhere, no one is safe. Deep cuts in product support, product development, relationships, technical expertise, and thus, a lack of resources to do the right thing for clients. As a Sales person, if you care about relationships, you could spend months with. your client on a product escalations, because there is just a lack of people and skills everywhere. You join the product support escalations not because its your job, but because your employer isn't treating your client well, and someone needs to heal the relationship, but there is no help available.

Client representative,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"There are a number of reasons why IBM can be a great fit for you. Most importantly, the company encourages a healthy work/life balance. Time off is abundant, and the hours are not rigorous. In addition the company treats many employees as ""mobile"" workers -- working from home or working out of an office as needed. Also, since the company is so large, there are a number of perks and benefits. So, if you are interested in a relaxed work-environment and lots of flexibility, this is a great option. Also, the IBM name on a resume is a great asset.","IBM does have some challenges, and is not an optimal choice for all. Since the ""mobile employee"" concept is enforced for many groups, it becomes challenging to develop a sense of teamwork or camaraderie. There notion of the office ""water cooler"" is non-existent. One might argue that such ""off the record"" interaction does not necessarily contribute to productivity -- the issue is that inter-personal, informal interaction is limited. The other challenge is one that many large companies will face -- different groups are often incentivized in different manners. It is not uncommon to have internal groups encouraged (and rewarded) to operate along divergent paths. Lastly, you will come across an arrogance at IBM -- that ""Big Blue"" is infallible."
Software qa manager,3.0,"Sep 22, 2016",Former employee,"For a majority of time I was there, I worked for one product line.  Some areas of the company have good local managers / leadership, which helps to provide a good working atmosphere where an employee can feel fulfilled with their contributions.

Salary seems to be a little better than average.","IBM is currently undergoing a complete transformation of it's business and business it deems 'not in its core' are being dismantled, with little regard to the intelligent resources that it affects.

Outwardly, IBM states that it invests in its employees and will allow them to move from between divisions / products, but in reality it provides little support to those attempting to get education to keep up-to-date technically or professionally (tuition support is touted but seldom is provided). 

Severance of those ""let go"" is now down to 4 weeks maximum.  Employees who are newly hired are given a 2 year grace period which keeps them from being included in job actions, but after that they can be targeted.

401k matching is only done on a yearly basis, so if you leave the company during the year there is no compensation.

Raises are minimal and depend on the area of the organization you work - personally I had received no raises for 5 years, although my performance reviews were between exceptional and acceptable all 5 years.

IBM is in the process of attempting to collocate resources into key offices with little to no ability to work remotely.  This has also affected work-life balance within the company."
Server build technician iii,2.0,"Oct 9, 2020","Current employee, more than 3 years","Training is good and there is a lot of resources for continued education.
The work load is balanced, and management should be receptive to a desire to do more for DC Operations.
Being a fulltime IBM employee you will receive the standard employee benefits (PTO, 401k, health/dental/vision).","Career growth is limited by how much of a priority you are to your manager. Communication is difficult and often obscured when trying to develop internally within IBM. Perhaps due to Data Center Operations being physically separate (and sometimes temporally) from other teams, and IBM Cloud being a separate ""child company"" acquired and in a continuous state of integration into IBM.
Based on the last couple years, full-time hires are decreasing in favor of contract workers without benefits. IBM should offer full-time employment on completion of training, but this could also change.
New hires are usually stuck on evening or night shift once training has progressed enough (1-2 months), moving off this will again depend on how well you communicate with management, or it may get you moved to a different DC site.
You are responsible for the office environment and equipment maintenance. If you and your coworkers don't stay on top of it, expect tools to degrade. You will have to be your own IT, while also dealing with IBM remote help desk (my experiences with them have been poor, regardless of the time of day I called in)."

Process engineer,3.0,"Jul 30, 2008",Current employee,I feel the company is pretty good with the work life balance.  Because the company is very advance some are even allowed to work remotely.  As an engineer supporting the manufacturing line you could essentially do a good portion of your job from home.  The company also provides good benefits at least compared to the other companies I have looked at which is really only two other companies.  They also have other little perks like different corporate discounts and rewards for great achievements (eventhough I hear they are not as good as they used to be).  I did enjoy most of the people are work with.  There are a good number of helpful people with in the company,It seems there is a lot of backwards thinking in IBM and not just within some divisions.  It seems to be company wide.  It seems like changes always loop back around someone.  The high level managers think they have an understanding of what happens at the lowest level but don't.  There always seems to be a different panic attack each day so it can get stressful at times.  Pick your day and you have some serious issue going on.  The meetings are endless and often pointless.  The meetings always make it seems like it's deja vu.  There is more time spent talking about the problem than actually going to correct it.
Senior managing consultant,3.0,"Aug 21, 2008",Former employee,"IBM is in the cutting edge of rolling out technology solutions to meet business challenges.  Whatever IBM comes out with like eBusiness, Information on Demand, Websphere, etc. is copied by the competition, but IBM is always ahead of the game.  The level of technical competence is high in the right pockets, which ensures that they could always execute with the right people on the team as members or SMEs.","There is an incredible amount of overhead between the people who do the work and the level of associate partners, partners, regional managers, practice leads, practice managers, industry leads, industry VPs, competency VP, etc in the Services area.  I would generate about $385,000-$555,000 every year in consulting revenue for the company, but my bonuses and raises were a joke for the kind of contribution I made to the company.  The overhead in Services must be addressed."
Consultant,2.0,"Jun 11, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","The people I work with are really smart. Great for the resume, as IBM is a pretty well respected company. My coworkers have left for great tech companies and top 5 business schools. Good benefits (but getting worse).","Hard to get recognition for good work. You're only as good as your PBC rating (IBM's end of year rating system), which can get pretty political and bureaucratic. Management is out of touch with employees and how they feel about the company. People at my level are VERY negative about IBM. Lots of turnover. In Public Sector you can get stuck on a project forever (I've been on the same one for my entire time at IBM and would have to burn a lot of bridges to get off of it, if I even could). 401K matching once a year is bad for employees. Do not feel connected to company as a whole. Management is out of touch with how employees feel about the company. Hard to motivate for IBM's success when the company doesn't give bonuses or raises for people who are supposedly performing well. After almost two years here, and performing very well according to all of my evaluations, I am actually making LESS money than when I started when you consider inflation and the fact that company healthcare costs have gone up."
Applications programming specialist,3.0,"May 25, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","IBM is so big that the Pros/Cons depend somewhat on what group you are working in.

Where I work all my coworkers were good, hardworking people willing to help out. There is a good work life balance, lots of vacation days, sick leave, and flexible hours. Medical, Dental, and Health insurance.","Management has very poor communication with its employees. My direct manager goes months without checking in on my to see how things are going. Emails from upper management are full of near meaningless business jargon such as ""Creating a playbook to sharpen your digital edge"".

The business model in my group requires employees to find projects on their own. IBM does provide a tool for finding projects but often times that tool call doesn't list all the projects or lists incorrect information about the project. Often times, projects are found through less formal methods such as word of mouth.

Pay is atrocious. Far below the industry average.

Email spam. Various people from around the company send you emails about projects and events that are not relevant to you at all. It got so bad I had to create a junk mail folder."

- The company will take care of its employees. In cases of natural disasters they are on top of things and ready to help. There is near 0 chance of discrimination of any kind, this is not something that IBM messes around with.
- Many experts available to consult in just about any area of technology, and business.
-","- Poor technical leadership, too many promotions to higher level technical positions that are based on politics, friendships, side-deals, and based on upper management perceived ""success"". Many high level technical folks manage up and are disconnected with the folks under them providing no real technical leadership for the ones doing the real work.
- Too much focus on dates, time-to-market. This trumps quality of the products, solutions, and services. BAD. The company is very large, so this tends to be driven by the culture established by the executives responsible for the various areas.

* Promotes imaginative and innovative thinking
* Flexible work schedule
* Variety of family hr programs","* IBM's top priority is MONEY - at the cost of their employees - IBM has turned cheap on it's employees
* Classroom Education has essentially demolished - most all classes are on-line self-study and are very limited in selection and MANY of those require management approval. If you are a programmer and want to take a class at a community college to enhance your skills that directly apply to your current position - the cost is yours! Even tuition as low as $125!
* Employee health benefits have greatly reduced - large deductibles and co-pays with limited in-network selection; Randy McDonald warned RTP, NC employees that if Obama was elected, IBMers would pay the price...AND WE HAVE!
* Business travel has greatly reduced - educational conferences, even for top performers, are unheard of.
* Coffee/tea anyone? That will cost you the SAME price as Starbucks...$1.60 and more...NO KIDDING! NOTHING IS FREE anymore! Cafeteria food quality has gone down and their prices are more than outside the IBM facilities!
* So as to save money in utilities, office supplies and workspace, IBM encourages work from home, thus, reducing team spirit and production.
* Salary and Raises? They are getting more and more skimpy and give team members identical excuses, regardless of performance.
* IBM should stand for INDIAN BUSINESS MACHINES. Outsourcing to India is huge and hurting so many IBM US employees. Job stability is threatened with outsourcing."

- They tried very hard to make the intern program fun and to bring us together socially. There were intern presentations, Main Event night, boat on Lake Austin.
- Pay was very good.","- Required to use internal dev tools like BlueMix that lower our productivity because they always crash.
- As an intern I came to the office every day but most workers at IBM ""work from home"" very often. I've heard that it's even worse outside of Watson.
- Pay arrived late, especially the promised Lump Sum Travel Reimbursement, which arrived 2 months after I had arrived.
- Senior management seems disconnected from reality on the ground. For example, there was a two-day intern finale event. They decided that the interns would spend paid work hours bagging rice for charity (which I think could be a great idea). They set a goal for 10,000 rice packets and we didn't pack that many during the scheduled events. The organizers were supposed to help with the whole process, but they didn't seem to care once the Instagram pictures were taken. So the rep from the charity was basically abandoned to pack the last 1,000 and pack it onto a truck.
- Lots of ""not my problem"" attitude about cleaning up common areas, sharing training data, etc. Most people are just concerned with their individual team."
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"May 11, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years","IBM is still a great name to have on your resume. They do some pretty cool projects, and you learn to work hard at IBM. For some people, things turn out really well at IBM if they get the right first project.","Projects are chronically understaffed. It's hard to get a good assignment. It seems the best work is hand-picked for certain people. YMMV, but the company is not interested in developing you. They will keep you in the same assignment for a long time, and make it very hard to transfer. In my case, I did a stint as a Support person. I then applied to a Development proper position (which I had done previously). I started out doing Development, but in less than 2 months, Support duties were added to my job, and then my job became that almost 100%. After years at that job working hard, I transferred to a new job, and I noticed that once again, I wasn't allowed to go to a Development proper position, they wanted me to do same job again!!!  Even though there was plenty of Development work to do on my new team, they would rather keep the project understaffed and behind schedule, than to hire one more ready and willing developer to help out, and go out of their way to keep me in a position I no longer wanted to perform."

Option to work from home which lets you avoid the commute.","Compensation is below market; my base pay was comparable to average pay according to Glassdoor but the bonus was basically non-existent.  I literally got ~$700 after tax for the bonus!   Many underfunded products/projects and long lead times to get things done lead to subpar products that aren't competitive.  No ability to retain good talent; see good people who can leave defect to other tech companies (i.e. Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Startups, etc.) all the time.  Lack of opportunity to grow in the company.  Since IBM is shrinking, there are almost no attractive opportunities to switch roles and get promoted.   IBM is getting it's butt kicked by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in IaaS/SaaS/PaaS and AI and it is unlikely IBM will be able to reverse this market trend anytime soon.  Senior Management is too secure in their positions.  IBM has underperformed vs. peers for a decade yet most of the Senior Management team have retained their positions."

Positions in IBM customer facing roles build skills that will greatly benefit you in your next job, and you may learn how to recognize employers that you do not want to consider in the future.  IBM still has excellent products and these are worthwhile assets in your kit for future employment, especially if you are technical, and for pre-sales technical roles they still provide time to get and keep those technical skills.   You still get to work with some of the finest people in the IT industry, though they do not tend tend to stay long any more once they understand the way IBM views them and their compensation.","Lower pay than other companies, benefits in a death spiral and management lack of respect for the employee.   Compensation growth is non-existent, in fact likely to be negative regardless of your performance.  If you are not in a customer facing role your job is most probably going to a low cost country, though it may not happen quickly (IBM is accomplishing this slowly so it does not attract too much media attention).   A mobile workforce, as IBM has, often means working alone without support, and without adequate tools.   IBM expense and infrastructure policies mean spending hours a week accounting for travel and activity, which if you have service level agreements must be done on your own time."

There is usually a greater autonomy and less dependence on partners as a young consultant.

The people are a good mix of smart technology and business people who are driven but generally approachable compared to Deloitte (Jerks) and Accenture (Engineering Nerds).","IBM is not disorganized but there is no way it can be considered organized.  

The performance review and promotion system is one of the most bureaucratic, time consuming, non-value added and just annoying around.  Unclear expectations for moving to the next levels; levels spaced very very far apart.  A round down system that lowers your performance to your worst review which penalizes you for doing just ok on a first project which you are then penalized for one to two years depending on when you come in during the cycle.

Many managers are not helpful in developing you, encouraging you, or even answering e-mails.  There is high turnover for consultants here; they chalk this up to the nature of the industry.  That may be true but many leave because there is simply no easy way to get promoted other than to leave and come back.  Other offers during employment etc. aren't really considered in this system.

Two words: Lotus Notes."
It specialist,2.0,"Jun 8, 2016","Current employee, more than 8 years","Working remotely, health benefits, coworkers, and first line manager.","401(k) matching once a year, the lack of being able to reach anyone human in HR or any other department, lack of communication from the top. 
The biggest drawback, the constant layoff's, or as IBM calls them, Resource Actions.  While Companies layoff employee's, it is usually to rid themselves of deadwood.  At IBM, the cut to make the balance sheet look better.  Currently they are laying off as the Company transforms itself, but after 4 years of declining revenues, quarterly layoffs, the problem is not the workers, it is the upper management.  Being in sales if I have a few bad quarters, I get terminated, upper management has them and they get a bonus?  
Don't apply here if you want an employer you can grow with, here you will go down with the ship that is sinking faster than the Titanic. 
The CEO keeps changing direction and shedding assets to keep the shareholders earning.
The ship is sinking a slow but deliberate death, unless the top managers are changed it will continue to decline."

Management is odd: 1st/2nd line managers spend most of their time trying to be ""Project Managers"", not too much focus actual management.  There's a project management hierarchy that overlaps with these first lines, and adds little value ( though that might be the best career path).  Zero training. Zero travel. Development projects are overbooked. IBM is really pushing off-shoring to India.  You have to do your job, plus train a team of Indian developers; Middle management is pretty bad, they aim to please Sr management, customers, without consideration to their team.  Sr Management reaps millions, off-shores, and lays technical people off ; their is not a good connection between the team and Sr Management.  7-10 levels of managers in between, too much."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Dec 28, 2016",Former employee,"good 401k thanks to Ibm, that is all","merge is a company built on acquiring other companies, stripping them down, putting products they buy into maintenance mode and not developing them further, and bleeding the customer bases dry.  They have no concept of customer satisfaction, priority number one is pushing the sale even if it's something we can't implement or does not make sense for a customer.  Because all they know how to do is acquire and destroy, they have no idea how to develope something on their own that actually works (iconnect network for example).  Now Ibm thinks merge is going to be able to help release new products utilizing the Watson engine this year, not holding my breath on that one.  All departments are silos and getting them to work together is impossible, there is a culture of if it does not fall into my job description leave me alone.  Their sales leadership can be best compared to that of a used car salesman.  They litteraly would rather have their sales people sit at a prospects site for the last two weeks of the quarter and endlessly beg for the deal even if they have been told no decision will be made by then.  Nepotism runs rampant, the high level positions held by a number of upper managers who have zero qualifications to be in that position is amazing.  Upper management would rather have allies and yes men around them rather than hire someone who could implement meaningful change and question the current conditions."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jun 20, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","IBM owns and develops excellent technology that can really make the world a better place. The engineers are top notch, and they are highly valued within their silo. The company breadth and reach allows it to come up with innovative and creative solutions that has the potential to touch almost every aspect of life, from smarter cities to big data.","Almost every decision made is a ""breadbox"" mentality - can I save a buck right now by ___. The company is struggling to deal with the shift from hardware and software licensing to pure cloud models. This has a cascading impact on the broader company because it pressures the field to generate more revenue in lightly depressed markets to compensate for rapidly declining markets. In other words: unrealistic expectations. On top of that, IBM leadership second-guesses itself annually, moving back and forth between similar org structures. In addition, the company is so big that many of its offerings overlap with each other, confusing the sales force and the customer as to which solution is the right fit, ultimately coming down to who the rep is and what solution do they get paid on (versus what is right for the customer). Lastly, it is not a meritocracy. You advance your career inside IBM because of who you know, not what you can do."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Mar 6, 2016","Former employee, more than 10 years","A very large company with many career potentials. Worldwide presence makes it a great company to work for if you have an interest to work overseas. IBM was ahead of its time in so many ways including embracing social, open source, and cloud as the core of its business. Company has very smart people working in it. Work/life balance is good.","As much as the company was ahead of its time in many areas: cloud, social, mobile, and open source, it didn't do enough to make a lasting impact in the industry. There are smart, strategic IBMers who had long identified those up-trends. But senior management hung on to status-quo, focusing on mainframes, middle-ware, and once high margin hardware business. 

There is little to no career development. Most people are ""tenured"" are staying to retire. Executives are compensated based on earnings per share. This inherently steer them to cost cut in places where it matters most: high quality hires, education, and technology investment. Short-term gains and complacency lead to long-term decline of the company. Most executives are just waiting for retirement, leaving a shadow of a company that IBM once was."
Summit program solution sales specialist,5.0,"Sep 7, 2016",Current employee,"Summit is life changing! Throughout the 6-9 months of training, people are taken from being recent graduates with little experience to young sales professionals ready to sell for Big Blue. In the program, you learn how to not only be an effective sales person, but you also learn about how to engage with C-level execs. The salary is outstanding and the company is focused on investing in you through education. Managers are fantastic and truly care about enabling you to succeed. There is some travel involved. Lastly, the best part about Summit is that you are put with 30-40 people your age that you stay with throughout the program. This is not only great for networking, but it's absolutely crucial to building the culture and your experience at IBM. Some of the people in my group have become my best friends.","There are some cons about working here- IBM is an extremely large company and it's easy to get lost in the mix. It was also difficult initially to find enough work to do because they start everyone off slow. However, with that being said, it's on YOU to make sure you have your needs met. Whether that is by asking for more work, getting involved on different project teams, or telling your manager you're overwhelmed. A lot of my peers complain about things in the program that they have complete control over to change."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Apr 13, 2017",Current employee,"Great compensation & benefits.  Lower level team members are great & hard working.  Good & a wide variety of experience gained quickly. Working from home has been a perk, but they are getting rid of that option for most positions.","Written by a millennial: Currently, IBM is going through a massive change where everyone has to relocate to one of 6 cities.  This tactic is to get rid of the middle/higher level positions who are older & cost more for employment & targeting millennials to hire in.  This tactic disregards the expertise that the mid-higher level employees have in their field.  Team members who have been at IBM for 20+ years are unappreciated & forced into retirement or to look for a new job. 

In addition to IBM not appreciating their loyal & experienced employees, IBM has a horrible onboarding process.  Starting as a university hire, I was just dropped in without understanding my role, the dynamics of the team, & was assigned as the lead for large events within the first couple months.  If IBM plans to replace all of the experienced IBM employees with new young hires, they need to have a very thorough training process in plan based on roles that has a single person assigned to the success of the new hire.

Lastly, all direction comes from the top down.  Reorganization happens at least once a year if not more.  The majority of the time people are trying to understand their role & new team members instead of being able to get quality work done."
Digital sales stream channel manager,5.0,"Apr 18, 2017","Current employee, less than 1 year","If you want to be successful and change the world you work for a company like IBM.  IBM is on the cutting edge of technology and the opportunities are endless to those willing to work for it and earn it.  Make no mistake about it… its highly competitive, edgy, stressful and at times it can feel like pure madness.  This is what it takes to be a world leader in technology.  IBM can help you tap into the greatest version of you and come out on the other side a contributor to the brilliance that is IBM.
If you are interested in more than just benefits and you want to make a difference in today’s world… IBM is the place for you.  (FYI… benefits are great).  If you are just looking for a paycheck, “swipe LEFT”.  All things being equal IBM has their share of issues just like every other company.  No matter what company you work for, when faced with a challenge, you can complain about it or build a business case to fix it.  At IBM you can be part of the solution that fixes the problem.  
IBM is a wealth of vision and inspiration and always looking forward to the future.  I would challenge anyone reading this to be the change you want to see in the world… become an IBMer.

No yearly pay increase. Once you’re hired in, getting a raise is next to impossible even for stellar work. You get great reviews but keep the same salary, year after year, so you’re in essence working for less money due to inflation and when cost of living goes up each year. I’ve been working for ibm for 10 years, hired in at 100k, gotten great reviews for doing more, growing my skill set, advancing IBMs client base and technical position, and in the 10 years, I’ve gotten a couple 1200$ profit sharing bonus and a 1% pay increase and one 2% pay increase.......in 10 years. So I’m in essence making about 17% less less than when I started. (My money doesn’t go as far as it did 10 years ago, doesn’t pay the same amount of bills).

If you wish, you can have a varied career, changing jobs as your interests change, while maintaining the continuity and benefits of having a single employer.","The company can be somewhat management-heavy at times.  Sometimes it appears that there are levels of middle management that exist simply to keep people busy.  This seems to be especially the case in some of the older organizations that have been producing the same or similar products for many years.

If you are looking for a stable direction and reliable resources to support that direction, you may be terribly disappointed."
Advisory software engineer,3.0,"Jun 22, 2016",Former employee,"If your job allows, the ability to be able to work from home is a definite plus because I am able to avoid Austin's commutes.  The benefit package is pretty  good if you are single.","The thinking behind and implementation of the ineffective and destructive performance review process is supposed to be changing this year.  The challenge for the management team will be how to effectively change the thinking behind the old approach to performance review, with it's focus on ""distributions"" or quotas. This thinking is very ingrained in our corporate culture. Sadly, the previous system was build on outright untruths formally perpetuated by the management team, such as, ""There is no quota system."", which is legendary within IBM. You cannot build a team when staff are effectively played off against each other to improve their ""relative contribution"".  This would be at the heart of why staff avoid taking on projects with inherent risk because they are afraid of being punished if they don't achieve an aggressive goal by loosing their meager pay increase, being ranked lower, and possibly becoming the target of a layoff."
Senior managing consultant,2.0,"Sep 28, 2016","Former employee, more than 1 year","Global reach, a lot of bright people, brand recognition (though it is skewed towards computing even today). Base pay was good.","Be careful, experienced professionals! I was dropped in at a relatively high level and had not projects from the get-go in the 4th quarter, and they were not closing a lot of work at that time. I didn't get on a billable project for almost six months. In month 17, I was given a lay-off notice based on my prior year performance because of that 1st quarter with no billable utilization... Also, be wary of Partner and Associate Partner underlying interests - watch you back.

I thought I'd have a great opportunity to help out on large projects and run small projects - with all the breadth of industry and the thousands of ""open seats"", but without that early opportunity to really get known, you are dead. I had some significant successes in industry before moving to this role, but the capabilities were not easily conveyed given this lack of early opportunity to work on things in front of key decision-makers."

Manager,2.0,"Jan 31, 2009",Current employee,"More stability than most companies in the IT industry.  IBM offers flexible working hours, a true commitment to working remotely, and the tools to empower remote employees  The company offers solid benefits, and because it touches all areas in IT,  employees do have a chance to experience different areas.","The communications function is highly bureaucratic, highly political, and overall does not necessarily reward the most competent employees, but instead ones that fit a specific HR box.  All companies have to deal with this issue, but it's especially bad at IBM and in the Comms function.  It is not a function where young comms professionals should seek to work, although if you have at least five years of experience and want a big brand name, I would recommend IBM only as a short-term (three years) assignment before moving on to another company to leverage your skills and knowledge.   It is not a place to plan a career."
Supply chain manager,2.0,"Apr 2, 2009",Current employee,"Mostly good people and bright co-workers. IBM is good about letting people work from home (which is nice, because it's much easier to tolerate working with an obnoxious management team when you're in a remote location).","Executive management team likes to micro-manage the business, which causes LOTS of extra and unnecessary workload.  You spend a very large percentage of your time preparing for and giving status updates to senior management (often with technical details beyond their ability to understand).   There are some very good technical people at IBM , but the management system is so oppressive and smothering that few creative ideas ever see the light of day.   

IBM works very, very hard at creating the ILLUSION of being a good employer, but it's actions show otherwise.  Lots of companies have had to do lay-offs, but at least most of them have had the guts to publicly acknowledge the actions they are taking. IBM on the other hand prefers to surreptitiously do its lay-offs and off-shoring of jobs while keeping its employees in the dark."
Senior software sales representative,3.0,"Jul 23, 2010",Former employee,"I worked at IBM for more than 30 years where I made WONDERFUL lifelong friends.

Washington, Long Island, NY. 
I started selling Office Products, became a first line then a second line sales manager, and traveled extensively to exciting places around the world which I may have not enjoyed if it were on my own dime.

If I had an appointment I just blocked off the time on my calendar and went.  Vacation time was easy to get, very lenient approval process.  People with kids were always able to go to important things or even just volunteer in their kids' class.  As long as you are meeting deadlines and not really screwing up they were very flexible.  On the flip side, some times long hours were necessary.","stability
stress level- schedules are so aggressive it makes for a very stressful environment
little to no investment in employees' learning

If you're a early career ME there aren't a lot of options for you, it can be very frustrating.  A lot of hardware has already been sold and there's always a threat that more will be sold so stability is not good in this area.  Its hard to get money for certifications and school, not impossible but you have to really go after it."

IBM's management mandates too much data-entry with project tracking that drives employee measurement metrics with no indication of the outcomes. IBM has become too political and has adopted a woke culture that seeks to raise awareness of specific groups while making others feel guilty when they are innocent. IBM tends to lead from behind and focuses too much on the finances versus the technologies, and listens more to Wall Street than Main Street. IBM fosters an environment that creates internal competition by over communicating the successes and gains of employees who reach career milestones that they want to enforce, like certifications."

Software engineering manager,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"Working at IBM is like getting another master's degree.  There is so much opportunity to learn in this company, and in general, the willingness of senior technical leaders to teach (and of managers to support such education) is remarkable.  Although organizational politics will sometimes create barriers, the potential of this large, talented organization can be incredible when focused & engaged on a goal.  IBM also seems to be one of the leading firms in terms of ""walking the talk"" on work life balance.  While extensive use of work/life integration tools may be seen by some as stepping off the career fast-track, it is widely used, and the level of flexibility in many divisions/organizations is quite high compared to peer firms.","Bureaucracy is incredibly high.  People often compare it to the US Military or other such government bodies.  There will be 6 levels of approval for a $250 purchase.   There are layers upon layers of executive management.  At any given time, at least one other IBM division will be designing a product that competes with yours."
Global technology services,2.0,"Jan 17, 2009",Current employee,"IBM offers employees a solid brand name, ample benefits, and compensates managers well.  There are many smart people, with a positive overall culture.  Employees and managers enjoy helping each other, and IBM can be a great place to develop your skills and become a stronger person.  Don't confuse personal development with career opportunities, though.","Raises are rare and bonuses small, so either negotiate a high salary before being hired, or expect to be underpaid for some time.  A bloated, bureaucratic management structure weighs down the whole organization, so innovation comes slowly and way behind most of the marketplace.  All aspects of work at IBM are process-driven, so expect mountains of rules and documentation that frequently confound common sense.

Probably the worst thing about IBM is the employee rating system.  You are assigned your rating in a group meeting with all first and second line managers, and there is literally no objective criteria built in to the process.  To be rated well, you must be very good at managing relationships with your manager and his
peers.  The people who thrive are frequently not the top contributors, but the ones who self-promote and manage perceptions well.  IBM enforces a brutal ratings curve on the first and second line managers, so if you are not the leader of the pack, do not expect raises or promotions.  You may or may not have job security, depending on the year."
Associate partner,2.0,"Jul 17, 2014","Former employee, more than 10 years","It's a big company that has lots of diversity, exceptional staff, and a long history of reinventing itself despite bouts with failed leadership.  Historically, benefits were good and stated company ""values"" are focused on ""win-win"" philosophies.  Work-life balance was reasonable, and employees felt valued.  In some parts of the company, shreds of this history remain.

If you find the ""right"" group / division (likely in a low-wage or developing country), there's still hope of a bright future and a potentially rewarding career.","With the second consecutive CEO who lacks the ability to communicate coherent vision and direction to his/her employees, (aside from the relentless drive toward $20 EPS in 2015 which should be a byproduct of stellar performance, not a business target) the company has once again lost its way.  Layoffs of high-knowledge employees and inward-looking short-sighted policies rule the day.

Customer service has deteriorated as a result, and IBM's published sales numbers clearly paint the picture of the current trajectory.  Fear and stifling control are the bureaucratic tools-du-jour, with hollow strategies and PR-generating ""partnerships"" rounding out the equation.  IBM's nimbler and more customer-focused competitors are once again eating its lunch technologically, commercially, and service-wise."

IBM has been very good regarding working from home and working flexible hours around personal needs.,"The last 5-6 years pay increases for experienced, high-performing, staff engineers have not kept up with the dollar increases in the cost of health insurance premiums IBM has passed on to employees.  IBM used to be known as a family-friendly company by providing good benefit coverages for families of employees.  In the last decade, IBM has shifted the burden of providing insurance benefits for employees' spouses and dependents to the employees without increasing the pay to compensate for the added costs.  Compensation and benefit plans are geared toward bringing in young, single, employees at competitive starting salaries who generally only last a few years, while ignoring the dependable, experienced, knowledgeable employees who become stuck in the position of perpetually training the new kids who either wash out or are put on the fast-track ahead of the gray-hairs.  The employees who are the backbone of IBM are unappreciated, but often have no choice about leaving because they do not want to uproot their families."

Yes, IBM looks good to have on your resume but it's not worth the soul sucking torture you have to go through every day. Training is a joke, they rely on the person who had the role before you to train you in... my past two roles I've gotten because someone has been leaving IBM and they didn't really care about training me. This has left me feeling like I've been ""thrown to the wolves"" with both of my roles... BUT it's ok, because it's not like the work you do actually adds any value to IBM. 

I've feel like I've gained very little work experience in the finance field. 

If you do happen to take an FA job here, I hope you don't plan on growing your career here. There are very few opportunities for advancement. I guess I shouldn't say that, the Rochester COE does seem to love to do vertical promotions... you know, the type where you get more work but no extra pay. 

Overall, I highly advise that you only take a job here as a very last resort if you can't get another job out of college."

On a scale of 1-4 (1 = best), I was rated a 2 or 2+ for every year for over 20 years. I made my quota in 2008, was told multiple times during 2008 what a great job I was doing by my manager, then I was laid off in Feb 2009.
- Staffed very thin - be sure to take your laptop with you on vacation and set aside a few hours a day to work.  Actively trying to move most of their US based resources off shore to lower cost countries (""stealth"" layoffs of over 4600 people in Feb 2009 never announced to the press).  
- In sales, a generally high base salary (good) but limited leverage as they always adjust the quota, or ratchet back the pay plan to limit potential payouts. 
- Constant change and reorganizations, warranted in some cases, however it's just movement for the sake of movement at times. Management is sometimes disconnected from the relationships that the front line team builds with customers."
Storage administrator,2.0,"Jun 17, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","- The work from home options at the site were very good. We were only required to be in office a few days per week, with the ability to flex that as low as two days per week. 
- The managers were very understanding of how rough it was to work at IBM and didn't try and compound those issues.","- The instability was ridiculous. It seemed like every few months you'd hear about the next big wave of layoffs that were about to happen. Morale in the office dipped, and as each layoff passed the office became emptier and emptier until maybe 10% of desks per each floor were filled.
- They hired mostly non-technical people to perform technical jobs. When I had to teach a coworker who has been there for 3 years what ""ls"" and ""cd"" do on their AIX servers, I knew this was the wrong place to be.
- Major outsourcing to India. Basically every job was at risk of being outsourced, or in the process of being outsourced by the time I quit. The Indians they hire to replace the American jobs didn't seem to have much formal education in the field or any experience. It was a hassle training them.
- Second level management and higher are purely about the bottom line with zero regard for the human beings lives they are ruining by penny pinching and shipping jobs overseas. First line management also despised them, but they were powerless."

Consulting it specialist,2.0,"Jul 6, 2008",Current employee,"IBm offers a pretty good work life balance although that is starting to disappear. The benefits are pretty good too, and the 401K plan is possibly one of the best. You do have a certain amount of  flexibility and  the potential to move around the company, alhough this will likely depend on which group you are in and how well the business is doing. It is  not a given by any means which is what IBM advertised to potential employees. There is a great wealth of information and education avaialble to anyone who wants to stay educated and informed. The IBM name on your resume doesnt hurt either.","There is way too much bureaucracy and redundancy especially at the management level. There are sometimes literally 3 people to do the sae thing and to attend the same meeting. Each will have his or her own agenda too. The quality of the management is very ordinary overall though there are some really sharp people. All in all, the reason IBM is surviving is because of it's technical talent of which there is a substantial amount. This does not mean there is no deadwood as there as meany people who are there just to colect a salary. The promotion process is not always fair and career growth seems to depend too much on which group you are in. Life in IBM is much better as a manager or above a certain band level(* 9 and above)"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jul 13, 2008",Former employee,"I worked at IBM Global Business Services for 2 years.  IBM GBS is a great place to build technical skills and get experience with high profile clients through implementation projects.  There are a lot of older, more experienced consultants who are more than happy to mentor and help younger consultants build deep technical skills in ERP packages.  There was not a lot of pressure to perform and work/life balance was good.  The performance review system seemed to run well and I felt I got the recognition I deserved at the end of the year.  The training was good and I felt satisfied with the learning opportunities.","IBM GBS operates like a hybrid between a typical large industry company and a traditional consulting firm.  The nature of the work is similar to other consulting firms like Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, Capgemini, and BearingPoint.  Unfortunately, the nature of the internal operating model is more like working for a F100 company.  In other words, the raises are minimal and the company did not seem interested in retaining or differentiating top performers from the rest of the group.  As a result of this, there was massive attrition in the lower and middle ranks, especially for top performers.  Most of the people I started with are gone.  GBS also seemed to enjoy hiring older, more experienced consultants with no drive to progress up the chain."
Senior software engineer manager,4.0,"Apr 30, 2009",Former employee,"IBM supports a very flexible work schedule, focused on getting the job done rather than what hours were worked during the day.  Also, many jobs allow for some, all, or as-needed portion of the week to be worked from home at the employee's discretion.  Vacation time is self-managed and also very flexible.  The work environment (at least in Austin) is extremely casual.  There is a mind-numbing array of resources available to employees from freely available records detailing corporate policies, HR records, IT systems, capital requests, tools for managing corporate charge card, tools for booking your own corporate travel, on-line libraries, surplus stores, education, book ordering, volume printing, recreational activities, parks and facilities, etc., etc.  IBM also rewards innovation with awards for patent contributions.","Resource reductions without backfilling (at least in North America) leave too few resources overcommitted and burnt-out dreading the yearly review cycle.

Intranet search bites (i.e. while there are a mind-numbing array of services available, finding them is never easy)."
Sales,2.0,"Oct 8, 2018","Current employee, less than 1 year",6-12 month paid training with benefits.,"Salary is lower than what you could get in other sales/technical sales roles.

Prepare to do a lot do a lot of busy work. Some of the training is not relevant or helpful to the role you'll be doing and the important stuff is given a very surface level overview. If you want depth, that will be up to you, and your time and money. 

Because there are so many layers of management, you are often given very conflicting advice on what priorities should be and what you should be working on. ""It depends"" comes up a lot for answers to what should be simple questions. The phrase ""I'm By Myself"" is very much true and you will have to spend a considerable amount of time to find people who can give you meaningful help and guidance in your professional career.

As for co-workers, some are very nice and smart, but overall, many are  incredibly cliquey, arrogant, lack maturity and do not embrace the goals of having an inclusive and diverse work culture.  If you do not like networking or working on team projects with people like this, you will have a very difficult time in this program."

Senior program manager,2.0,"May 10, 2009",Current employee,"IBM offers diverse job opportunities due to its size and scope which enables mulitple jobs while staying with the same company.  Historically it has attracted smart people looking for this type of single-company career, allowing for extensive long-term personal relationships.  If you are selected to be a ""high potential individual"" then your work assignments will change at a fairly rapid pace and compensation will rise quickly as IBM tries to retain you. (Fall off that list and your career instantly transforms into a job.)  Mangement will push you into jobs you are not ready for to test your abilities to cope.","IBM is cutting expenses in order to drive executive compensation.  They are focused on employee expense, by cutting staff and nickle and diming in the US and other developed nations, and moving work to developing nations such as India, China and  the rest of the BRIC.  This is a rather sad state of affairs, where people are losing their jobs because IBM can find other people in other nations who will do the work for significantly less.  In the short term the savings to the company are real. In the long run, the spirt of the company will be lost."

Every year we lose something, they adjust something that takes money away from us and saves IBM money. In 2013, they moved the 401K match payout from payday to a lump sum at year end, and we missed out on all that interest. They moved the date raises are given to next year. They also decided not to pay out the bonuses they've paid every year since they started the program. No raise in 5+ years and I have much less to show for it. There is a major push to outsource most of the work over seas and only have about 15% of employees in the US. With so few US Employees, I get the sense that we are way too top heavy with management and all the overhead that comes with it."

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Oct 14, 2021","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM has many great programs for employees to grow in all aspects of their life and career. Management is very supportive in making sure you have an opportunity to take advantage of these programs and will encourage you to push yourself. Although there are moments where deadlines are critical and workload reaches capacity, these cycles typically don't last long as management often listens and finds a way to ensure you are not working yourself thin. Everyone is very helpful and always willing to assist and give advice when needed. It is definitely a team-spirited environment,","The innovative spirit no longer exists as it once did. The goals and projects are all aligned with perception in the cloud market, where there hasn't been much focus on IBM creating its own new frontier. To this, competitors are able to take advantage of this opportunity by offering better compensation packages and more interesting projects to work on. Although, you are at the mercy of the decisions made by leadership with respect to how the company grows in relation to the market and competitors. The biggest con is going from a cloud leader to not being in the BIG three anymore where pride has taken a hit, especially if you were in it from the start.

- Risk adverse. IBM prefers to buy instead of build their own. I've witnessed first hand a business proposal for a new amazing idea (containizeration in its earliest days - before Kubernetes existed) get rejected. IBM purchased Red Hat to catchup vs. take the risk internally to develop the idea. Many other examples similar to this observed over the years.

Kissing bottom is taken to an art form and there are more angles on everything you say and do than a billiards game."
Digital design engineer,4.0,"Oct 23, 2009",Former employee,"IBM is extremely progressive in work/life balance.  You can work at home pretty much whenever you want/need to.  The number of sick days is unlimited.  There are no timesheets to fill out for most professional workers.  Some employees work part time, and parental leave is up to 3 years (unpaid).  There is paid parental leave:  6 weeks for new moms, and 2 weeks for new dads.  Overall, coworkers are very helpful and willing to go out of their way to help you.","Long hours tend to be the norm at this company, and some people burn out.  The downside to working at home is that sometimes you are expected to be constantly connected.  There is a lot of schedule-driven quality (i.e. the schedule is king, and quality falls by the wayside).  Worst of all, IBM has very strict transfer rules.  You can only transfer to another department with your manager's approval, and sometimes they don't give it.  I wanted to transfer from digital design to hardware simulation, and even though the new department knew me very well and wanted me, the process took over 1 year."
Senior product manager,2.0,"Apr 11, 2015","Former employee, more than 10 years","The opportunity for worldwide travel. The ability to have multiple jobs without leaving a company. This is both good and bad. You'll work with some of the smartest people in the world. Flexibl work schedules. Medical dental 401k. Loads of discounts for personal use including hotels, car rental and financing, electronics, cell phone service, entertainment and many many more. Continuing education. Financial advice, maternity kits including breast pump, books and guides. Great place for a first job. The perks are too numerous to name. You just have to know about them and hope your manager does too.","Because IBM has products in so many areas, it has many competitors which means you often get stuck using IBM products instead of the best products to get your job done. No investment in its own infrastructure so it can react quickly. E.g. Archaic financial systems. I don't recommend staying with this company longer than 2 years if you have been acquired, after that you lose your sales force and the team of whichever native IBM solution is comparable to yours will start to make life difficult. Pay is not great. Except very small raises and smaller to no bonuses as a top contributor."
Security technical specialist,5.0,"Feb 10, 2016","Current employee, more than 1 year","Great Company, Benefits, Team Members, and a chance to learn from a vast number of technologies and excel in many ways whether be it personally and or professionally. There is an abundance of resources and sometimes way too much to sift through, but non-the-less there is information about everything and anything you want to know, learn to better understand and deliver. Great place to be in and a chance to travel around, abroad, move up or parallel, meet people from around the world, and sometime literally, participate in events, conventions conferences, make a difference, make an impact not only within IBM, but within other companies, and even on a global scale. ""Who said that Elephants can't dance"" IBM is leading the way for future generations and companies as well.","With Big companies, you tend to spin your wheels a little, and management will assist and help, but moving up sometimes is slow, raises are almost a rarity and sometimes frustrating. 
Best thing is to Love what you do and you wouldn't mind the minimum raise. Persevere and you'll move up, move around, or move out! Very High Demand on meeting quotas (if you are in sales or technical sales)"
Software engineer,3.0,"Mar 27, 2021","Former employee, more than 3 years","- IBM has a very open and accepting culture. Everyone there is really nice and usually easy to work with.
- Good work life balance. Being out of the office for appointments, children's events, mental health, etc. is very well supported and encouraged.
- Some of the projects are cool, and it's rewarding knowing that many people depend on the software you work on.","- I couldn't tell you how many people there are that do literally nothing and never get fired. It is infuriating feeling like you could do the same and it wouldn't matter.
- Some very talented people work here, but at the same time, many incredibly un-talented people do too which ruins the company's/team's progress.
- The pay isn't competitive. IBM will always lose it's best talent to companies with better pay, benefits, and less red tape.
- Deadlines are a mess. I'm surprised customers continue to use IBM products at times given the outages and issues that occur so frequently at the end of every quarter.
- Designing for the customer gets lost in the complexity of IBM's systems. There are so many features that seem good on paper, but are really hard to use/missing functionality that a customer actually needs.
- No one will advocate for you in your career progression - you must do so yourself."

Program manager,3.0,"Sep 8, 2008",Former employee,"Great company reputation.  Lots of different lines of business to move between over the course of a career.  Pretty good as far as work life balancing, especially in terms of coming up with flexible working arrangements for people with differing needs (e.g, work from home).  The stock purchase plan was pretty generous in terms of the discount versus the market.  There were always a lot of training opportunities available.  There are a lot of smart people especially in highly technical parts of the company, but the business side functions were weaker in comparison.  IBM still does offer the opportunity (though no longer the guarantee) of long term tenured employment.","Career pathing is very nebulous outside of Global Services.  Expect a slow, slow progression in your career track even if you are a strong performer.  Company is pretty conservative and not very entrepreniurial.  Managers weren't always well trained in career coaching and development skills for employees.  Although they are clear that 'you own your career', sometimes it felt more like an excuse not to have well defined career tracks instead of really empowering employees.  There were not a lot of opportunities to network with other groups in the company which also made it more difficult to take advantage of the size of the company in terms of growth opportunities.  Salaries are OK, but don't expect much in the way of incentive compensation or substantially better pay for high performance."
Project manager,3.0,"Feb 2, 2009",Current employee,"Excellent people to work with.  Good benefits, 401K match, managers are generally good about vacation.  There are opportunities for career growth, but one must make it one of your goals to advance.  The problem is people are so busy working, they don't spend time on planning their own career.  Another positive in IBM are the opportunities to work on patents.  Generally speaking, I found colleagues are bright and industrious.  But it's not a place for slackers.","Just like anyplace, there are some good managers and some bad managers.  Good managers open to improving the way things work, not just the way things look on a chart.  Good managers also try to develop their staff and help them advance their career interests.  Bad managers often look out for themselves, not for the staff.  They will pressure people to make unrealistic goals; do not plan well and then work everyone into the ground when the plan is broken.  Careerwise it seems to take a long time to advance unless you have been at the right place, or connect with the right people.  But that's true everywhere."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Apr 10, 2010",Current employee,"Flexibility is great.
Work from home.
Benefits are pretty good overall.
No micro-management (this, of course, depends on division/organization and employee's skills/performance).
Annual salary reviews (depending on your performance review, you get an increase, I have always gotten an increase every single year, but in recent years that increase is about 2-3% only).
Annual performance bonus.","Base salary paid is a little lower than other top companies in the Austin area.
Off-shoring like crazy... too many folks here in the states are getting displaced by employees and/or contractors overseas.
There's smart people anywhere in the world... but it seems that in many cases IBM just hires ""global resources"" without conducting a good technical interview.... and what happens next is just horrible... you, as the person facing management here in the US, then have to deal with these folks who lack technical skills and you are asked to make it work...
If you are a good and excellent software engineer, you are rewarded like this: you become the lead of some ""global team"" and you are left with very little time to own a component since you have to spend a lot of time on communication: many global resources do not speak English and/or lack many technical skills (sometimes the need to do baby-sitting is just too much)."
Graphic designer,1.0,"Jul 10, 2016","Former employee, less than 1 year","- Flexible work from home option (or anywhere there's a WiFi connection)
- Freedom. Often your Managers are in remote locations
- Travel (if you like that) Sometimes in interesting cities. Accommodations are nice
- Benefits are decent but declining
- Recognizable name on resume","- Impersonal. You are literally a number. You are assigned a serial# on day 1 and this becomes your identity within the company
- Difficult to form relationships with colleagues. There was a complete lack of camaraderie, which fostered competition within my own team and other divisions
- Antiquated internal systems. (i.e. filling out Excel spreadsheets for job tracking purposes)
- Incompetent Managers who knew nothing of the creative process and like to play office politics, favorites and are extremely bureaucratic. Conform to the IBM way and do not speak the truth
- Expectation of 24/7 availability including weekends to meet unrealistic demands and short deadlines without any incentive
- IBM = I'm By Myself. You are your own HR, Admin, Travel Agent, Security and Office Manager and so on
- Have a question? Good luck navigating W3 (IBM's cumbersome intranet) to find answers to the simplest things
- Some office locations are deplorable. My specific mobile location was something straight out of the 80's. No perks. Not even a break room
- Their idea of training and skill growth was watching online videos, of which you are required to complete 40hrs a year on your own time
- Low morale due to constant lay-offs (or Resource Actions) and a sickening severance package of 1 month no matter how many years you dedicated your life and career with IBM

Overall, working for IBM was the worst job experience of my 15+ career as a Graphic Designer.

Your own experience will vary widely depending on the division, your managers and your working environment preferences."

-First/second even 3rd line managers no longer have any decision making ability. 
-The forecasting process is non stop - with more time spent forecasting and presenting sales forecasts to multiple mgrs/levels than actual selling. 
-Raises are almost non-existent and usually only 1-2%. 
-Benefits have continued to decline with healthcare contributions continuing to decrease and employee costs skyrocketing. 
-There is no longer a pension plan, the 401k match happens once a year, in January. So most silent layoffs happen in 4th qtr. 
-30 day severance is the new policy whether you have 1 year of service or 40. 

Overall company environment has gone from poor to absolutely toxic. Many of those who remain are looking to leave or actively doing so.

Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jan 30, 2017","Current employee, less than 1 year","Some of the smartest minds I have ever come in contact with, working on some technology that has, is and will continue to change the world in ways many of us don't understand.  IBM is quietly behind the scenes of so many of mankinds' biggest breakthroughs and businesses that power our economy.  To have a hand in developing and delivering this thinking and these technologies to market is an incredibly exciting opportunity.","The organization is at times, too smart for its own good.  They prefer slow and perfect over agile and testing and learning.  It is a culture that tends to avoid risk taking, with a rule and process to follow for EVERYTHING - sometimes, multiple conflicting rules for the same process.  IBM is interesting also in the sense that what makes it such a successful and valuable company (the tech intelligence/pure brilliance of its people), is what hurts it when it comes to bringing its cutting edge ""stuff"" to market.  IBM has a problem translating smart tech jargon into language that clients can understand in terms that address their needs.  We lead with tech, while others like Accenture, lead with problem solving and understanding the client first."
User experience designer,5.0,"Jul 17, 2018","Former employee, more than 1 year","At the time of my employment, IBM was providing a 3-month bootcamp for new hires, where they essentially walk you through how to design for an enterprise company. I felt extremely fortunate to have started my professional career with this program, as it taught you how to collaborate, organize, present, and execute outside of a college context. 

IBM's Design program also cares deeply about company culture, and hire people that I found to be some of the best to work with in my professional career. They understand that the ability to collaborate is far more important than talent alone.

Additionally, I found extensive room to grow during my career at IBM. My boss allowed us to create our own programs, such as ""learning sessions"" to learn, for example, Github from our front end dev, and attend conferences. Teammates who stayed on after I left were also promoted to leads to reward their growth and contributions. If you find the right team within the company, the opportunities were invaluable.","Retention. Unfortunately, the structure of this bootcamp led to lofty expectations of work environments outside of the Austin office. I gave such a high rating because I personally was very fortunate to be part of a great product we have a lot of personal control in, and saw through from research to launch. However, it really comes down to the team and the office location. The design program is large, and every experience I've heard has varied greatly, along with how long they stayed on at IBM."
Manager,2.0,"Mar 7, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","I am surrounded by good people who know how to deliver high quality software.

They will definitely lay off huge swaths of people at the drop of a hat. Considering that they don't seem to have much mastery in developing worthwhile products, you would be well-served by keeping some money liquid in the event of a layoff. 

Hilariously, *every* piece of software that we use internally is worst in class, including IBM's own products. Every process is ill-defined and difficult to navigate. Knowledge is not shared except through social networks.

There seems to be opportunities for software engineers to move around internally (discovered after layoffs), but I have yet to find anyone who was happy with their move. Opportunities for managers are nearly non-existent.

The benefits are terrible. I hired someone and was able to give him a sizable increase, which he lost (and then some) when he had to pay for health benefits."

Little higher than average pay","Senior managment and VPs are VERY out of touch with the average worker.  They have no clue about the repurcussions of their actions down the chain, and they don't care to learn either.

IBM operates like it is on the verge of bankruptcy.  Expenses, resources, and test budgets have been cut to the bone.  Now they are drilling for the marrow.

Almost impossible to back-fill contractor team positions.  IBM refuses to pay contractors what they are worth so turn over is high.  How can I keep contractors on my team when IBM pays 14-18$ an hour and right down the road Cisco, Red Hat, NetApp and Nvidia are paying entry level contractors 23-28$ an hour?

Old times are very smart people (can't say the same about the new people being hired at band 9 or higher)","I didn't see us adding any real value to our clients, I got the feeling that a lot of poorly repackaged material, full of buzzwords, was circulated as new ICAP. Although this is standard in consulting, it seemed far worse here than elsewhere. 

I noticed a high turnover rate. New people (APs, Architects etc) coming in, want to immediately impress their managers and I saw a lot of them taking credit for other employees' contribution 

There is an insane focus on Utilization...IBM wants close to 100% of your time being billed to a client. This leaves very little time for employee development and training since you're working 50-60hrs a week on projects. 

There's a process for everything. If you haven't been with IBM for a while, it's impossible to figure it out without some handholding (which isn't easy to get). 

Often feel like you're operating in a void (to be fair this depends on your manager)

Since that is changing (i.e. ""co-location""), I can not think of another reason to remain.  I like my work, but not my job. There is a big difference.","There is an ongoing level of chaos at IBM that is toxic. At times, it can seem exciting and it gets spun that way (new strategy! new products! new org structure!) until you realize that it never ends. Never. Ever. Then it is just exhausting. Additionally, the top-down mandates keep coming, demanding more and more from fewer and fewer. Also exhausting. Meanwhile, benefits and pay are no longer competitive and they continue to diminish except for the precious few who are in the upper echelons. They tend to be the same people issuing the mandates."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"May 9, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","Work at home (though rapidly disappearing), some select areas of genuine innovation and distinction. For now, relatively strong brand. Pretty solid employee benefits, but few perks.","IBM is an inward-looking organization, and a slow-moving one but with a few fast-moving areas. Every quarter the message from leadership is, ""We fell short overall, but our positive results in x, y, or z show that our transformation strategy is working. We all must execute better going forward."" Lay offs follow and it's up to the survivors (increasingly hardened operators) to spin even more plates, or appear to, before the axe falls again. IBM spent over a billion dollars last year buying its own stock to keep the price up, and laid off tens of thousands as part of that winning strategy. It's been doing this for many years.

In my experience, every year the volatility and toxicity of the environment grows. Top and bottom performers get smart and leave or are laid off, and what's left are the very senior IBMers and a vast middle management culture, though at this stage the wolf at the door is starting to eat them too. I guess that's the IBM version of ""Scrum"" and ""Agile"" (though teams of competing IBM experts would want to argue with me on my use of terms--may the expert with the best positioned senior director win).

My advice: work for a different company, one that cares about its employees' careers and isn't playing a vast and very long shell game."

The constant layoffs create a specter of uncertainty therefore employees are regularly grooming their resumes and looking for other opportunities (hence you lose the best employees).

If you feel like you've hit diminishing returns in Product Management, you can get into Sales, Strategy, M&A, Partnership, Development, etc, if you work at it a bit.","- IBM is a big company, 300K+ employees world-wide. Parts of IBM are extremely well managed and up-to-date, with healthy cultures, others have awful outdated processes, terrible cultures, or management that lead through fear instead of intelligence. As a candidate, you need to scrutinize who you would be working for, the culture of the team, how it and you are measured. It is not worth working for a bad part of IBM.
- Diversity could be better. A lot of great improvement over the last few years, but more work required."

Anonymous employee,4.0,"Sep 28, 2008",Current employee,"Environment of constant change and complexity, particularly due to IBM's global focus.  Good management with opportunities for advancement.  Also, increasing flexibility in work location (telecommuting, etc.)  Work projects are often very challenging, so being bored is never an option.  On the other hand, getting major initiatives supported and off the ground can take a seeming act of God, so patience and persistence is not only a virtue, it's absolutely required.  Leadership often provides good communication from the top down, particularly as IBM embraces the social media to get the messages out to an increasingly distributed troops.  But individual initiative is still key for personal growth.","Global exposure can often mean regular 12 hour days.  Complexity of business environment (matrixed organization) can mean lack of clear direction and focus, leading to a consistent sense of being overwhelmed.  Despite all the focus on communication from top leadership, due to the complex nature of the business one will find often competing goals and objectives within the organization, so an understanding of the ambiguous operating environment can either frustrate or foment, depending on the individual response.  The long days can become overwhelming, so the employee needs to know when they should turn off the Blackberry/ThinkPad -- IBM will take all that you can give them."
Advisory software engineer,3.0,"Dec 20, 2008",Current employee,"- Job flexibility. If you are determined to excel in your position then a world of options are opened to you. The complexity and far reaching nature of the company allows one to gain expertise that isn't even a part of their job description.  If done right, one can mold their career and create a position suited for themselves.  
- Technology. If you are in a development/test role then you have access to just about all hardware/software available. Any OS, programming language, tape drive, hard drive tech, networking infrastructure.. etc... is there. 
- Benefits.  Compared to many other companies, the benefits (medical, 401k, options....) are among the top.","The major down-side is definitely work/life balance. Although IBM advertises a great balance, you'll only find this being used by those whose roles are not essential. Any valued leader will find themselves faced with understanding the big picture. This applies to the matrixed organization, product design, team dynamics, market direction, and even client satisfaction. Due to the large nature of the company, understanding and working with the previously mentioned aspects takes much time... more than 8 hours in a day.  There are many within the company that simply do not go this far in their understanding and their work/life balance is probably great... however it places a burden on others in charge who have to make up for their shortcomings."
It specialist,4.0,"Apr 27, 2010",Former employee,Most of the people are really nice and hardworking.  The company has a good reputation.  Excellent with EEO.  Often very flexible with work hours.  Compensation is competitive and benefits are good.,"As a general rule, you will be expected to work at least 50 hours a week and do give back in addition to your normal work hours. This is to meet productivity goals and must be done even in slow times.  (Giveback is good, it you had the time to do it)  The job is not secure.  Periodically IBM does massive layoffs.  It doesn't matter if you are on the bench or have a revenue producing assignment,  if you are in the wrong group at the wrong time, you will be laid off."
Software engineer,2.0,"Aug 29, 2010",Current employee,"Lab is quiet and remote. Flexible working hours, working from home. IBM's external recognition is still somewhat good, so it has some value on a resume. If you are starting fresh from school, it can be a good place to learn and gain some experience. Decent benefits. Many locations around the world for relocation.","A lot. Low pay, no transparency at all about company decisions, bureaucracy at its best. It has to be the workplace in the world with most meetings per capita, where most of the workforce career goal is to to reach some (people or project) management position. The quality of the technical workforce as been aggressively depreciating with the top performers regularly leaving as they cannot stand the management hypocrisy and all the politics anymore. As a result, IBM is today one of the last places where recent grads and tech workers apply for jobs in the Bay Area. Most of the fresh-out-of-school hires come from San Jose State Univ, as IBM cannot capture the interest of students from top schools. This then reflects in the lower quality of work and software development practices. Definitely not a place to stay long after you get your first 2-3 years of experience, unless your goal is to be in management."
Program director,3.0,"Aug 19, 2015","Former employee, more than 5 years","Brand value, resources, flexibility, ability to work from home. Plenty of smart people and perhaps a good place to learn how big companies approach problems and operate on a global scale. Great for technical people who prefer extremely well-defined roles where every process and procedure is already laid out.","Aging, stodgy, painfully slow promotion schedule, endless career ladder, and almost everyone's a lifer. This makes the environment incredibly myopic, political, and people are expected to stay well within their tightly defined roles and position on the totem pole. Workloads and expectations are high, and it's the kind of place where it's ok (and expected) for managers to regularly ream their hardworking staff the slightest typo, shortcoming, oversight, etc. As a result, people often fear their managers, who fear their managers, and so on."
Sales leader,2.0,"Mar 28, 2022","Former employee, more than 10 years","Remote work, for the most part a very ethical company (but google dinobabies), committed to diversity and LGBTQ, adequate pay and benefits, some products are good. Rank and file are good people. Good work life balance and for the most part managers care about their people.","Micromanagement to the extreme, very little sales manager empowerment, unreasonably focused on metrics and pipeline over actual performance, commitment to many product lines is virtually non existent, too much sales generalization - the expectation is that you may sell dozens or hundreds of unrelated products. Constant territory churn, horrible CRM that is simply used for forecasting and not working with clients. Huge emphasis on ""cadence"" where everyone has to spend hours each week reviewing deals and next steps with execs. Horrible lead generation and marketing in general.

We could not retain many young successful sellers who were constantly being hired off by more agile and focused competitors with better cultures. Sales can be a tough job and IBM's micromanaging sales culture makes it worse.

IBM is not a bad place to work but could be so much better by modernizing it's sales culture. I would be cautious to recommend this as a place to work. Depending upon your situation it might be great, or not so much."

Intern,3.0,"Jun 24, 2008",Former employee,"I can't say anything about the other areas of the company, but the research division (where I was working) had a very laid-back, academic atmosphere. The research staff members I worked with had a ton of freedom in setting their agendas, choosing what kind of papers to publish, etc. and seemed quite happy overall with their jobs. Lots of opportunities to collaborate with people inside and outside the company; many were involved in projects with Stanford, Berkeley, UCSC, and other universities in the area.","First, the bureaucracy was horrible, worse than I ever could have imagined. It took me almost two months to get my first paycheck because someone entered my address incorrectly into the payroll system. Nothing is handled locally- you have to call some faraway place to get help, going through layers and layers of people who are either incompetent or uncaring. I had the same problem with the IT support- I couldn't get into my email and was forced to spend 2 hours on the phone with a poorly trained, unintelligible support guy in India until I could finally talk to someone who was able to fix my problem.

Second, the workplace had some serious deficiencies. The onsite cafeteria served nasty, low quality, unhealthy, overpriced food. The ""gym"" was about the size of a broom closet and had only two machines. These and other things made me feel that the company didn't care about the happiness of its employees and was willing to cut perks for the short-sighted objective of reducing costs."
Senior software engineer,3.0,"Dec 5, 2008",Current employee,"If you find a position right for you on a team that is in one of IBM's core businesses, you'll probably be happy.  There are lots of good people in ""Big Blue,"" some of which are extremely well connected in global terms, opening doors to potential opportunities.  Strong work and leadership are likely to be recognized and leveraged and, in time, rewarded.  Size and stability can raise security, which is especially useful for people with families or other long term responsibilities.  There are a broad range of businesses and roles, lateral moves into areas of preference or growth are quite possible.","The company is a behemoth, and with large scale comes processes and cold impersonality - its unavoidable.   The company had laudable policies re ""people first"" and compensation, much of that has gone away.  If you're outside the mainstream business, you'll likely be struggling for resources and the attention of policy makers.  Much of the internal technology si not competitive with what we find on the internet, and this is an unfortunate burden for the company.  Opportunities are subject to the usual competition, do not go to IBM expecting to be a software architect without proving yourself for a decade or more of dues against a bunch of talented others."
Senior managing consultant,3.0,"Sep 13, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Compared to other IT consulting companies, the culture is pragmatic and focused on delivering the right thing for the client. IBM is obviously huge, so it is what you make it. You'll work with very diverse teams. Some teams will be great, others will be poor. If you are willing to put in 60-70 hour weeks doing 40+ of client delivery and 20+ of business development and figuring out how to navigate the internal processes, you'll do great and get promotions and advance. If you want to work 40-44 hours a week just doing client work, you'll have a secure job, but don't expect a raise no matter how stellar your performance is at the client site.","Business development and proposal process is a mess, and you seemingly reinvent the wheel every time. 
It's easier to get a new job than get on a new project (this is really just for Public Sector GBS). 
You have to fight to make your own career happen, no one else is actually looking out for you. It's your job to write your own project performance evaluations, write the case to apply for a promotion and at the end of the day there are really just 2 numbers that matter most: billable utilization %, and dollars of sales wins."
Summit program,5.0,"Sep 15, 2016",Current employee,"The IBM Summit Program hired me (along with several hundred other millennials) for an intensive 6 month sales training course.  The program includes guidance and interaction with people from varying branches of the company.  Early on, a social culture with an emphasis on networking, teamwork, and problem solving was established.  In the first learning lab, we were pushed to make a series of mock sales calls.  We received constructive feedback from the sales advisors and our peers and then proceeded to watch and critique our fellow trainees as they made calls.  It was one of the most productive learning exercises that I have ever been a part of... and I used to be a teacher.  This company offers a wide range of opportunities in a variety of areas.  I came in with an open mind and willingness to learn.  It is a great place to be if you are open to constantly learning and adapting.","It is a very self-paced program.  Some people choose to sit in the back row in the literal and figurative sense as opportunities pass them by.  If you are highly intrinsically motivated and are interested in a culture of constant growth, this may be a good fit for you."

I was able to take classes to expand my skills, go to conferences, and ""flex out"" for excessive overtime.  The best thing about IBM was definitely the people I worked with - these were the most hardworking, intelligent, creative thinking people I have ever met.  These employees were truly cream of the crop.  Unfortunately, times have changed, and most of the benefits I initially saw with IBM are long gone, and I don't believe it will get any better.","I had absolutely no job security, very few raises, and you were expected to work enough hours and overtime time make up for any vacation, sick leave, or other time off - plus an additional percentage.  Funding for education seems to have been frozen for the past 4 years, so forget about any classes unless they are free and downloadable... and taken in whatever spare time you can find.  Any compliments about a job well done were followed with expectations of more, no matter how impossible.  All in all, the last five years my quality of life dropped substantially, and my morale was at an all time low, a sentiment shared with many co-workers.  2009 brought the ax down on many of these wonderful hardworking people - and these people will go to competitors."

They still allow employees to work from home in some jobs and that can be a real plus if you don't have to travel a lot.  They have some promising technologies if they can bring them to market cost effectively.","What haven't they taken away?

Software engineer,3.0,"Dec 18, 2015","Former employee, more than 1 year","I had great, smart, experienced engineers on my team--everyone was a great teammate. Mine was one of the few dev teams at the company that got to use Macbooks instead of Thinkpads. Most of my coworkers had spouses and children and the company really cares about work-life balance: they paid us well in salary and benefits, and didn't expect us to live and breathe work all the time. I had the flexibility to leave during the day and/or work from home when I needed to.","I felt very out of place as a new grad; there were plenty of designers my age in the next building over, but very few young engineers. That's not necessarily a bad thing since my older coworkers were very experienced and had a lot to teach me. I was unhappy because of the day-to-day bureaucracy and how set in their ways the managers of my team seemed to be. Meetings were 30-60 minute conference calls every day. Individual offices are great for senior developers but personally, as a fresh-out-of-school developer, I felt isolated and depressed in my cold, windowless office. I would recommend this company to a person who is at least 35, but not to any of my friends who are my age."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Sep 30, 2016",Former employee,"Flexibility in working hours is amazing, awesome work/life balance; that might change a little as I heard they are requiring some co-location. If you proactively manage your career & skill development, you can laterally move across jobs roles and positions. Complete some large projects, and move on to other areas, do not stay in one position for too long. 

401k benefits are great; large selection of investment options. ESPP is available. Benefits as a whole is comparable to other IT companies. Health benefits not as competitive for families though.

Globally integrated employees allows you to interact and experience many different cultures; it is a great learning experience and development for entry level workers.

Lots of opportunities in the growth areas of the business (Cognitive, Security).

Great place for Millennials & Generation Z to gain Enterprise experience for 3-5 years.","Healthcare benefits can be very expensive for families. 

Limited quality training and education; IBM offers many 'free' online courses and training, but quality training is minimal. You need to be highly proactive in keeping skills updated sometimes w/o a clear understanding of the business priorities to align your skill set.

Language barrier with a globally integrated company; it can be difficult sometimes to be highly productive. 

Certain divisions are not growing and generating revenue; management makes decision based on the best interest of the business without regard for their employee skill set.

Average 15-25 employees per manager; manager interaction can be very limited with career progression constrained."

Morale is very low.  My comment in the pros section is when an employee starts.  After the first project the employee basically understands that IBM would trade them for a dog if the dog could write code or architect a solution.
Watson is a myth.  It is not ready for prime time and IBM is marketing cognitive like there are not limits.  I'm sure someday IBM will market 'cognitive' toilet paper."
Data center facilities manager,5.0,"Feb 22, 2022","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM was a fantastic place to work, with a great work-life balance. My management and leadership were always tremendously supportive and recognized the contributions of the team. I enjoyed my time there. I was outsourced with a change in corporate strategy which led to a spin-off of their GTS division to Kyndryl.","Raises and bonuses were meager, though the compensation and benefits for everyone was fair. The only way to get significant raises there was through promotion, which I was fortunate to have achieved. Unfortunately, this could not be the case for everyone.

As it was a mature company with no growth in that segment, we were all just waiting for people to retire so we could clamor for their jobs. Many times those promotional opportunities evaporated when the organization restructured to eliminate the job after their retirement. 

The end result was that promising young engineers with other opportunities left the company. People with little other opportunity or high risk aversion stayed around, and company performance continued to slow.

Many times the corporate culture and process were extremely bureaucratic and focused on cost-cutting to the long term detriment of morale and business agility. The company continued to centralize so much spending authority to finance over the years that it became very difficult to maintain the facilities, which ended up deteriorating."

Lots of intelligent managers with valuable experience. Excellent top-notch benefits (401k and health insurance arguably the best, as well as free financial adviser). IBM name commands respect on your resume. Flexible work schedules.","Annual raises are poor whereas new-hire starting salaries are superb. It's highly likely that new-hires will start the year after you, or 2 years after you, with higher, or very similar salaries to yours, including your raises--even if you get outstanding performance reviews year after year. It seems there is more effort spent on acquiring new talent versus keeping and rewarding existing talent. This discourages existing talent from staying for any length of time, or continuing to strive for excellence year after year. An excellent performance review doesn't mean anything if it isn't backed up with financial reward. It just helps my resume look more attractive to recruiters elsewhere.

Also the company laptop situation is poor. On starting day you receive a used, refurbished laptop which is supposed to last you 4 years. That would be fine if you weren't also forced to use it for such basic things like checking email and billing hours--why can't I do these things on my own laptop/tablet/smartphone?

If you're a technical person, there is a path for that and most of the management team is happy to have people that have good quality technical skills. There are some select projects that are still good to be on.","I also know a lot of smart people who have left the company. Bonuses for the most part are gone. Raises, non-existent. The constant threat of getting caught up in a resource action. A lot of people are often double booked (depending on the project you work on) and those who are smart enough to go, often do when they realize that the peaks and valleys of a project have now just become constant peaks with the expectation that you are available all the time.

That's when they bring in 2 contractors for the work of one person and then dump one of you after 2 weeks after they decide which one of you they like better. A lot of looking over your shoulder if you're not connected to some one in mgmt. More emphasis on what your ""special project"" looks like on paper and not what you do day to day. In tens years, ten managers only one who provided and sort of support or guidance. Very stressful once you know the score. Not loyalty anywhere and to anyone. Purely dog eat dog.

As IBM is really banking on AI to pull itself into the future, you will be exposed lots of AI techologies like NLP, computer vision, some element of creating models for classification and prediction.

The DC office is on F and 14th so very conveniently located one block from metro center.","The mentorship opportunities are little to none. Everyone who has the technical competence to be a mentor is overworked and overstressed, and you can only really get them to spend time with you if you happen to be on the same project. I have been on several projects where I, with less than one year of experience, have been the lead on a project simply because everyone else is too expensive or unavailable.

While you are exposed to these AI technologies, it is unlikely you actually get to work with them hands on. Most AI in our projects depends on Watson APIs (whose accuracy is definitely not cutting edge), so you're mostly making API calls rather than building a model yourself, so there's little opportunity to gain experience or understanding.

A lot of the projects they deliver to the client also often have pretty low usability because we are severely lacking in front end engineers and rarely talk to the Design team because they're too expensive."

User Research  is still not recognized as its own independent discipline and rather considered a specialty under design. If you are a User Researcher and considering joining IBM. Be prepared to constantly be called a ""Designer"". Be prepared to not be included in many conversations and decision making efforts because many still don't understand what user  research is or how it can help other than concept testing. Be prepared to be told what to do by the design discipline because ux designers and user researchers don't have equal seats at the table... you will not have a easy time. You will not feel fulfilled unless you luck out and have a team that somehow has established a better process than the rest. You will have a difficult time growing your career here as a User Researcher. You will have a very difficult time recruiting participants, you will be micromanaged, ignored, etc.) You will witness UX Designers get promoted and awarded and applauded frequently while you feel stuck... bored.... stressed.... overworked.... fatigued.... unmotivated.....depressed"

Ww marketing manager,4.0,"Jul 18, 2008",Current employee,"Work/life balance is excellent.  IBM has a large mobile workforce and its very common to handle all of your work, calls, etc. all from the comfort of your home office.  Showers are optional.  Large company allows you to work for a new 'company' with every job change. So for example, you can work in one role for 2 or 3 years, then take on a new opportunity and you will feel like you are starting with a new company all over again.  New names, new issues but you keep all your benefits.  Pockets of the company have excellent, intelligent people.","Very centralized management team.  You have to be here for 20 years to become an executive with a VP title.  IBM has a lot of internal 'grow your career' materials and systems, processes.  But at the end of the day it's who you know.  If you are well networked, you might advance but IBM's culture only allows for 20 year veterans to take on VP titles.  And just because you 'survived' for 20 years doesnt mean you deserve a turn driving the ship.  There are often far more qualified middle managers and non-managers who would be more effective executives as they are closer to the business."
Senior development engineer,1.0,"Nov 29, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","All the positives of working at IBM are in the rear view mirror.

If you are an executive who gets stock options then IBM is a great company to work for.  You don't have to worry about growing the business.  No matter how bad the business performs IBM will keep your options afloat by buying back Billions in stock.   

If you just draw a salary, maybe you should look elsewhere.","IBM thinks that paying 90% of the midpoint of the market range for a position is competitive.  If IBM wants to only hire people 45th percentile then maybe so.   There are no raises for anyone making more than 45% of the range.  If you are well above average and contribute value that is well above average then why would you settle for having your salary capped a a level that is below average? 

Employees are discouraged, stressed, broken, frightened and afraid.  Mass layoffs, over and over and over have decimated their ranks and destroyed all trust in management and in managements ability to run the business.   

Every year IBM increases the cost of benefits to the employees but salaries never seem to keep up.  

IBM's hardware business is imploding and the executives are clueless.  But if we use social media and Tweet and Like about how great IBM is maybe things will get better.  :-(

Turnover at IBM is very high and the number of people who know how to get things done keeps deceasing as the brain trust gets fired, retires or decides to leave the mess that IBM has become."

Astonishingly, brand name remains relatively strong, although this may change over the next few years and is certainly no guarantee.","Executive suite very obviously does not care about employees, slashing perks and letting infrastructure languish while paying the CEO massive annual bonuses for horrible market performance. Decisions banning common consulting perks, such as alternate travel, Uber as an approved taxi provider, are taken without employee input and can be reversed, but only after sustained, near-universal outcries, and marked increases in attrition. Cool ideas out of Research division and Watson are brought to market before they're ready for enterprise application, and very basic MBA1 management ideas that would improve the company are rushed or diluted to death.

Tone-deaf evaluation system, often approved by entrenched management with little incentive to provide accurate feedback and no useful answers for very basic career development questions, such as ""how do I improve for the next evaluation cycle?""

Entrenched management: without an up or out policy, there is incredible stagnation around the engagement manager level, where talent is particularly thin. Technical skills in basic software, such as Excel and Powerpoint, is incredibly limited at these levels, leading to dumb questions and poor estimates for delivery timeframes.

Generally speaking, good talent finds its way out, and bad talent falls upward, resulting in very, very spotty talent throughout."

2. High probability of getting stuck with a manager who does not care for you or the company.

If you get visibility and perform well early on in your career then you can get fast tracked for your entire career!  You'll almost always get more opportunities than people not on the fast track and be able to fail repeatedly without much consequences.","People on fast trackers must never say no to an idea.  Often management has brought you an opportunity they think will help your career, rejecting it implicitly means you are rejecting their help and you will be punished for it.  
People not on the fast track are doomed to middling careers without much growth.
You'll notice a huge gap between software development veterans (20+ years) and younger talent.  This shows that IBM doesn't do a good job of keeping younger people happy as you progress in your career.  The older folks are there because they can't find another job.  The mid-career people are all gone because they realized there is no future except for a few fast trackers at senior, STSM or DE.

There are lots of things to like about the company if you are interested in selling by committee - having 10 plus people, most having different opinions and know very little about the client's needs, on an strategy and tactics conference call. It's the client representative and their manager who holds the quota for the deal. Therefore, it's the client representative and their manager who should be in control the ""going forward plan"" for the deal... and not a gang of 10 bureaucrats.","There are too many people involved in every deal. In my experience, a meeting to establish strategy and assign tactics would be held and people I didn't know would attend. It got so bad that I ultimately started my con calls asking attendees to state their name and what value they offer to winning the deal. If the person on offered their name and some bogus value I asked them to drop the call. Not unexpectedly, I did not win friends or influence many using this tactic. 

Sales teams (in this case, those responsible for proving the technology and winning the deal) must remain small. It's the sales person, their manager and the systems engineer who must take the lead position.

You can work very hard, accomplish a great deal and still be given a bad or average performance rating just because you were not visible enough to the right people or simply because it was your time to take one for the team.

* Work life balance. IBM is a globally integrated organization. It encourages WFH (after the 1st year of stay at IBM). You will be surprised at how addicted one gets to using Sametime for chatting as well as for scheduling meetings.
* Culture. IBM is a very open company. It is a no non-sense company where Senior leadership is very committed to doing the right thing. IBMers have a bias for the right action.","* Compensation. IBM brand is one of the best in the world. As a result, do not expect to be compensated heavily.

Software engineer,3.0,"Apr 1, 2014","Current employee, more than 5 years","Great people. Most everyone is willing to help you come up to speed. Ample time to learn and build  your skills, particularly when coming out of college. It easy to move up if your willing to take some risks and work hard, at least in software group it is.","As a team lead, processes are more than ever to release a product. You count yourself as a full time developer yet meetings, helping the new hires because IBM pretty much only hires those out of college, you find yourself struggling to find time to write code.  

There are many people who are happy putting in there less than 40 which in some ways stagnates the group as a whole. No one is learning anything new, thus just a few key folks end up knowing much and they don't grow because the group is not educating themselves as a whole. I get it, its not a silicon valley company to have that drive but why shouldn't those who work there want to learn and grow themselves?"
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"May 16, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years",There is a lot of exposure to different industries. Its very easy to have a career at IBM where you can change what you are working on every few years without getting board working on a single project/technology.,"The company is too big for its own good. The company doesn't care about the employee and due to its size takes forever to approve requests for simple things like a notebook or a box of pencils. There are a number of standards that they put in place to ensure all the application have a similar design paradigm means that creativity, exploration, and progression through a fast paced ever changing world is nearly impossible. Its impossible to move up in the company, raises/bonuses are few and far between, No company outings, health care options cost more than any other company I have worked for or heard about. At the end of the day the only things the upper management cares about is whats in their paycheck, the promises made to the stockholders, and they really don't care about you as a person.

On a business note, our customers were also frustrated with the speed at which IBM moved. They need fixed, enhancements etc to compete in their market. Waiting for yearly releases just isn't possible anymore. customers need a more agile release process where they can get releases and change faster and they can put them in place more quickly and efficiently."
Senior consultant,3.0,"Aug 30, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years",IBM still draws some of the best and brightest. The work can be quite interesting and challenging. And the company offers flexibility in terms of work times and locations (unless you're required to be at a client site).,"There can be a strong feeling of disconnection. You may work with a team that's widely scattered or based elsewhere, and rarely if ever see them. You spend much of your time on conference calls, often at odd hours if you're dealing with colleagues in other parts of the world. Managers range from good to awful. Unfortunately, I encountered more of the ""awful"" than the good. And finally, career growth can be difficult to impossible. Even if you're a top performer, raises are small to non-existent. The company sets targets that never seem to be reached, at least as far as producing income for employees. The shareholders, on the other hand, almost always hear a much rosier story."

High Management churn as I had 14 managers in 18 years and only 2 of those managers are still with the company, Benefits have been cut over the years, Stock purchase plan is poor.

It felt sort of casual but I worked in the research division so this does not reflect the company overall. Also, I felt like I was a part of a team and valued for my work but that I was also allowed to not know something. Almost everything I did and knew was from working there, not from school, because people took the time to teach and explain stuff to me.","I did not feel valued by the company at large, so by upper management above my own manager. I was pigeonholed by one high level manager and deemed invaluable to the company because of this view held by said manager. The research division is full of contractors and supplementals and only PhDs can get permanent positions there. The basic message I received from this is that the company doesn't want to invest in anyone who isn't 100% exactly what they wanted coming in. With that said, there could be groups that align with this viewpoint as well and I just happened to end up in groups that didn't.

Another con, for contractors at least, is that they bullied me during salary negotiations. We agreed on a salary and then when it reached for the final approval, they demanded we lower it by 15%."

I did not read it, but the title is great. There is a saying, ""RAs are family matter"", such as people actually try to make a living and support families while the elephant is stumping around them.

Very bureaucratic and inhuman, people are only resources. If you spend at least 3 years here, you will notice that half of the people you worked with are gone by that time. Extreme amount of talent is let go by the constant RAs. At the same time the company is hiring new people for the same skill set. I have not seen any effort to match existing talents with opportunities. I actually would like to see proactive management of the work force by constant training, re-training, cross-training according to the changing need of the company.

Benefits are getting more and more expensive, compensation is stagnant with zero inflation adjustment.

This year's most important stuff is ""diversity and inclusion"" and giving people lessons about the ""unconscious bias"", but this seems to be an attempt to tap into cheap labor even more. What about professional competency, which itself would include the above already?

Applications developer,4.0,"May 21, 2021","Current employee, more than 1 year","As a current IBM employee, it depresses me sometimes to think back on my past employers and just how many of those workplaces were managed by ""man/woman-children"" who -- more often than not -- let emotion and personal biases control the daily decisions they make. At those places, *genuinely* good ideas by lower-level staff would be ignored 100% of the time if the idea somehow threatens the manager’s brittle ego or even *slightly* increases their workload. These were Tywin Lannister-wannabes I’m talking about – that view their employees as a group of undisciplined children requiring constant supervision, restricting the tiniest of freedoms and establishing authority by reprimanding non-offenses. For these ""control-gestapos"", managing isn't the goal. Coasting through a life of upper-middle class perks and authority (in title only) is their only motivation. They inhibit any and all culture and creativity from a work environment and drain the lifeforce out of their staff. Sirius Black would never have escaped if Azkaban had a swarm of micromanagers flying around in black hoods. I will be honest with you here… I consider each and every single one of these Putin-sympathizing, workplace-tyrants out there actively defiling our country’s workplaces to be my eternal arch-rivals. 

I guess what I’m trying to say here is IBM does a good job of saying “do this thing by the end of the month” and leaving you alone.",You will be constantly losing roles to other IBM-employees who are more qualified because their CV shows they previously worked in a similar role.

However, after my departure I would not recommend working at IBM.","I left to take an opportunity outside of IBM in February of 2022. I had overall great experience working at IBM over my 3 years at the Company. Upon putting in my two weeks I was immediately notified with 1 hour that it would be my last day. 

I had ended the previous fiscal year FY 2021 at 176% of my sales quota. After waiting 6 plus months to receive payment of my commissions I was notified that I would not be compensated for any of the deals that closed in Q4 of FY'21

I was eliminated from the payment sales pool from one of my deals. The IBM team justified that because I was no longer working at the company in FY'22 I did not deserve to be compensated as part of the team. The deal was closed in December of 2021. 

On another deal, again, the IBM team justified that because I no longer work at IBM and I did not sign a quota for FY'22 that I am not entitled to compensation under the FY'21 compensation plan which I did sign.

IBM is notorious for setting up Sales Plans and not compensating its Sales Team in a fair manner. In addition, IBM does not pay on time. IBMer's are still waiting to be compensated for December 2021 commissions."

Better employer value for somewhat unskilled working to gain industry experience, though it can be a commodity environment; lower-level candidates will have more ""advancement"" opportunity.

1. The pay at the Baton Rouge CIC is low comparatively and relatively. I personally worked there for ~3 years, and was still earning under $50k annually as a developer. 

 2. Management is out of touch with the developers. When things don’t go as planned, management fails to take ownership over developers. Overall, management doesn’t care about developers. They only seem to care about developers charging hours to a project so they meet their numbers. These, among other, managerial issues are deeply rooted in the CIC. I have seen similar issues brought up to upper management, and sadly, little or nothing is done to address the issue's root cause.

THERE ARE NO RAISES. THERE ARE NO PROMOTIONS. ""YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A JOB.""

Want a raise? ""You're lucky you HAVE a job."" They paid me around 30,000 despite having a 4 year degree and providing training for the entire office. They ""pay overtime"" on top of this, but overtime is not allowed/never approved. If you are forced to work overtime and complain about it, you will be randomly selected as a poor performer and fired. 

Many North American jobs are going to India / Brazil / Argentina.

Anybody they hire, which they don't actually hire people by the way, are severly undertrained for their position. It's quite literally people off the street. One of the people on my team was a basketball player, for example.

Disagree with illegal practices, i.e. threatening to fire people for not working free overtime? ""If you don't like it, why don't you quit?"" (This is probably why IBMs centers are largely in areas with no job competition).

Somebody sexually harasses you or makes a racist remark so you file a complaint? What a coincidence, you've been selected as one of the North American mass firing targets. Certainly no correlation to the team of lawyers that showed up to plan your firings for weeks!

Coffee is considered a luxury. If you are a ""whiney complainer"" about things like ""Not being paid your legally agreed upon salary"" then they will threaten to take this away. Nothing else is free."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Oct 2, 2008",Current employee,IBM is probably the best company on earth that has successfully incorporated work/life balance into its business culture. IBM helps the world get a little bit more green by supporting its employees flexible workplace options and thus help reduce consumption of fossil fuels for commuting. IBM for the most part exhibits tolerance towards diversity and different backgrounds and truly incorporates diversity into its business model.,There is very little career prospects or skills growth opportunities once you join at IBM at any given level. New projects and job opportunities are handed to known and safer contacts within the department and there is very little if any cross-departmental hiring (huge silo mentality). It is near impossible to get promoted and very difficult to get reasonable salary increases even if you put in years of your life with hard work and dedication for client success. Constant threat of off-shoring and reorganizing people at the whims and fancies of executives and low-morale of the employees.
Managing consultant,3.0,"May 14, 2009",Former employee,"- Access to vast information resources
- Professional environment
- World-class corporate reputation
- Excellent place to build a foundation en route to a better job","- Zero investment in developing people, for instance, no formal commitment to ongoing training but plenty of pressure on consultants to train and obtain certifications while trying to remain billable
- Contradictory environment in which IBM controls consultants' deployments on engagements but consultants bear the risk of not being utilized
- Awkward, ineffective, and frustrating evaluation system which penalizes consultants for not having evaluations but fails to censure project leaders who fail to provide evaluations
- Growing practice to place timeline over quality
- Compartmentalization of roles and delivery practices making cross-training in another discipline practically impossible and virtually ensuring the diminishment of a consultant's value when practice areas mature or IBM decides to withdraw from that particular business
- A somewhat peculiar corporate culture typified by a ""guilt trip"" work ethic which often leads the leadership to fill their agenda with volumes of special projects of little or no real value. (This may explain why IBM has so many internal systems which seem to do the same thing)."
Software engineer,2.0,"Jun 10, 2013","Current employee, less than 1 year","Work from home was allowed at any time, no questions asked. No hour tracking or anyone making sure I was meeting quotas as long as I was getting my work done.","The team moved slowly, and individually. There was no sense of teamwork or camaraderie, only individuals with tasks. This was exacerbated by the fact that upper management was forcing the departments into Agile, which led to employees used to doing waterfall to simply do waterfall with iterations. Agile was used entirely as an hour tracking tool for the bosses to send angry emails every day based on their pointless charts, which were based on numbers that everyone was making up.

As a 20something, being the only one in a sea of long time employees with the next youngest employee being in their 30s is a bit of a shock. The fact that IBM only hires college hires or internal makes for the young ones to want to leave, and the internals to result in an echo chamber where no one advances the team. To have to use a version control system whose last major update was in 1995 is insane and will scare off any new talent to a more modern company (where modern in this case could be someone using CVS...)."

They have had consistent layoffs or selling of technology since 2009 reducing the local site almost 50%.  I understand every company has had to adjust in the current economic climate, but match the above w/ IBMs record Earning Per Share numbers and astronomical revenues and it's a simple formula.

Client solution executive,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Former employee,"There are a number of highly motivated, smart, ethical peers employed by IBM Global Services.  The outsourcing business, in particular, is a hotbed of creativity.  IBM Global Services has, in many cases, done an excellent job in de-centralizing decision making to allow the creative juices to flow in developing client-facing solutions.  IBM's propensity to allow people to work from just about anywhere is a highly satisfying policy.  In most cases, they truly do not care where or when you do the work, just as long as you get it done.  They expect each employee to get it done well and on time.","Management can be less than completely forthcoming at times.  The executive review of work completed under very stressful circumstances can be frustrated.  Occasionally, executives do not reveal all of their motivations such that the end product can be architected to meet all expectations during the first run through.  The compensation for high performing non-management sales types has room for improvement.  A downside of the current environment is no clear sight in to career advancement opportunities.  Highly qualified people can be stuck in the wrong position for too long.  The annual ""chipping away"" of the non-salary benefits programs, which may be true of many companies, is a source of irritation."

It needs to learn how to act a lot faster, and has tons of catch-up work to do to get to the level of a Google or Apple in speed of execution and delivering innovation to the marketplace.  This could be an opportunity for people looking for that challenge.

There are a lot of well paid people in IBM that don't really understand how the work is done.  This slows down the delivery of new innovation and make setting clear realistic goals difficult.

Staff software engineer (band 7 software developer),3.0,"Jul 2, 2015","Former employee, more than 5 years","The culture amongst IBM's engineers is one of collaboration and cooperation. I really liked that primary communication was done through chat, not email, and that engineers were generally immediately helpful in getting others unblocked. Combine that with the fact that the engineering core is highly competent, very driven, and run a broad range of experience levels, and you have a very efficient and effective work environment.","IBM's executives have been gutting the company to keep an earnings-per-share promise from a decade ago. US workers continue to be laid off in big chunks, replaced with cheaper labor in China and India. Furloughs have also become commonplace, meaning that their otherwise middle-of-the-road compensation is actually below market averages. Their intent to unburden themselves of their hardware holdings is quite clear despite their clumsy attempts at veiling that ""secret"", which means that the remaining loyal workers are facing an uncertain future."

If you have a vision, are a good communicator, and don't mind putting in the elbow grease, then you can have a lot of fun building out programs, products and technologies (depending on your skillset) that have the potential to affect a great many people and industries.","If you're a pessimist, you'll probably focus on how long it can sometimes take to see progress. It does take patience and vigilance. It's a big ship to turn, so it might be especially difficult for people coming in early in their career or from a small business or startup environment. It's all a matter of perspective. I also think the HR practices are a bit outdated, but that doesn't affect most people's day to day life. 

Another issue that has come up more recently is the sheer volume of new hires from the outside not being vetted sufficiently for a fit with culture and values. It's great to have a lot of fresh thinking, but it's hard to tell who has integrity, who can deliver in this complex environment, and who is just a stuffed shirt."

Managing consultant,1.0,"Jun 19, 2009",Current employee,"Let me first say I have worked for IBM Global Business Services for a relatively long time (8 years).  Pros include a fairly good benefits package and decent salary.  IBM brand recognition also helps your resume a little, but the brand recognition is for software and servers, not consulting.  There is a decent number of fairly intelligent peers you work, although the numbers are declining.  It's a good place to go for a year or so to gain technical skills then leave.","IBM GBS has morphed into one of the poorest run entities in business.  Communication is silent within the organization.  This is because there is nothing but bad news for employees.  Revenue and earnings are growing astronomically while employee raises and bonuses have been trending the opposite direction just as fast.  This same pattern has gone on since 2002. This year IBM has decided to skip promotions to save money yet raise what is known as the skill level for promotion qualified employees so they can bill them for more.  IBM and its senior management are extremely money hungry and employees are treated like chumps (and you are a chump if you continue to work for such a firm).  Its very sad, but you're not a consultant just a person you provides IBM with a source of income.  Expect nothing in return.  In fact, top rated employees with the highest evaluation rating were recently laid off after being ""on the bench"" for two weeks."
Staff software engineer,2.0,"Jul 27, 2013","Former employee, more than 10 years","Most of the ""PROS"" were diminished from 2008 until I left, but they were:

PBCs: In the beginning, your goal was to support the goal of your direct manager. You were treated as a professional and given the ability to define how you would support those goals, and you were measured by the success. This meant something, at least in the departments I was in, for many years.  In recent years,they became a joke. 

WFH: This was a blessing for a long time, it afforded work/life balance.  It became a means for 24x7 days as commitments were outsourced around the globe.","Bungee Cord Management, obvious use of ""3"" rankings to push out those with the most experience, due to their higher salaries and age.

But much of what I loved no longer exists - including respect for employees and trustworthy management and a fun working environment - yes, it was fun!  However, the only benefit to working at IBM these days is the flexible work schedule and the ability to work from home.","The constant layoffs (at least one or 2 RAs per year involving 3K to 5K US employees, each time, for 5 years now), and the various incentive programs to increase attrition make IBM an extremely dismal and demoralizing place to work.  IBM has more recently stooped to increasing the quota percentage of negative appraisals across target organizations.  These ""3"" appraisals identifying ""lowest contributors"" are a way of avoiding costly layoffs for which IBM annually takes a $1 billion restructuring charge.  So, by falsely and unfairly identifying hard-working employees as ""3"" performers, IBM is able to force these people out without severance packages.  These appraisals are not fair, and long-time, hard-working IBMers are being cheated out of their severance as those targeted for the ""3"" appraisal generally have enough years to collect the maximum 6 months severance through an RA."

But in today's culture its the opposite.  20% are happy 80% are looking for new jobs or are just trying to hang on","IBM describes its self as a large ship.  Well the ship is sinking..... IBM has brought on a new set of executive management.  None of which know IBM and each of them trying to put their own spin on how things should be reorganized.   I am very very disappointed in how IBM is treating its employees.  There is zero loyalty and concern for the best part of the company ""its incredible employee base""   My recommendation is to run far far away.   If you like working tons of extra hours, with zero work life balance ( which used to be a great benefit for IBM) and zero appreciation from upper management then this is your company.  You will see many new reviews on how wonderful IBM is.  This is because new people are being hired and have yet to experience the true company."

It's pretty much a tracking device to see how productive you are. There is completely no organization. There have been so many re-orgs that everything is such a mess. Account officers seem to work against you but your relationship with them determines how successful you are in the position. Managers act like they're always in a bad mood and not very helpful and they are will LIE to your face like it's nothing. The morale is low and the employees there are disgruntled.  Everyone is now hired as a contract worker. You get no vacation time and no benefits. Don't believe the story that you'll get hired on full-time after a full year.  LIES!!!

If you're lucky enough to not be laid off this quarter, expect your product list, territory and client assignments to change next quarter, and every 6 months thereafter.  Rather than sell/grow and expand, you are constantly having to rebuild a new territory and provide major damage control to unhappy customers, all while attempting to exceed a mind numbing impossible to reach quota - just in time for the next 6 month switch-a-roo!  Way too many incredible industry leader colleagues burned out and left or those who stayed have been laid off for replacement new graduate hires.  Serious lack of upward mobility - I was offered 3 amazing promotions from other managers during my 4 years in Sales - all denied by my hiring manager.

Basically, simple things such as finding and filling out information actually becomes a huge task which wastes your time.  

Layoffs are constant.  You are a number and everything you do is largely solely tied to your utilization in consulting.  Working with offshore IBM - which is now most of IBM - is worse than imaginable.  All the offshore IBMers literally need a checklist of things to do or they won't do anything.    

You will be blamed/insulted/stressed for not being 'billable' despite it only being senior director/partner level employees who can get you on one or sign one.  As a consultant/senior consultant/manager consultant you are completely at the mercy of random luck and getting stuck on some project which probably has nothing to remotely do with your skills."

Global opportunities - Able to transfer to other geographies (with company need/approval).

Ever-diminishing morale, as ongoing cuts are made to Systems group, leaving those who remain increased workloads and low job security.

Even after jumping through all the hoops, like writing publications and filing (questionable) patents, employees can still end up being RA'd (laid off).

Managing consultant,4.0,"May 29, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years","Mostly smart, hard-working individuals work as consultants at IBM.  The company name opens a lot of doors and provides instant credibility.  There is a lot of room to grow and if you work for the right people, you will be given opportunities.","The work-life balance is OK as far as consulting goes.  You work hard, but most people at the company do as well.  The compensation is a little below average from what I can tell.  With respect to training, there are a lot of online training resources available, but in-person, in-class training is very limited and is the first thing to be cut when the economy goes south.

As with most consultancies, the major emphasis is on ""utilization,"" which more experienced consultants may be able to affect, but entry-level ones have very little power over, so this can be frustrating.

My biggest beef with IBM is that it is a constantly changing environment in the sense that there always seems to be a re-organization going on so it is hard for employees to understand how they fit in.  Also, I do not believe they truly understand/appreciate strategy consulting.  They know IT strategy, but not pure strategy because they focus on big, long-term, multi-year contracts, which is not how strategy consulting works."

Almost everyone you will meet working at IBM started their careers at IBM and there is a reason for that. The employees or senior management don't really have exposure to the real world and they just don't know how bad the place is. Things like the lack of coffee or proper drinking water for employees do not bother these people because they haven't seen any better. The place is a dump. Culture is awful and from the actual work you do (which most of the times is completely meaningless, because of the antiquated management and reporting systems in place) to the treatment you get at the cafeteria (where you are a paid customer but the guy at the grill is out smoking while the cafeteria is open and the cash register person is nowhere to be found because you're in the middle of some kind of forest and there is nowhere else to go) everything is awful.. but because nobody at the company has seen any better, nothing ever changes. If you come here with prior work experience, nobody will care about or even understand what you did before. Management isn't interested in the real world outside, and the results they produce show it."
Hadoop/open source technical sales,1.0,"May 20, 2016",Current employee,A large company culture. Excellent sales training and good work life balance.,"Not sure where to start. Within Software sales division, IBM hired some 30 odd Hadoop Hunter Sales Engineer positions only to give them notices within 6 months. For the CEO/SVPs it seems like these are just ""budget games"". A VP comes up with the Hadoop Hunter idea and without any due diligence gets some $6-7MM sanctioned by the CEO. Then he hires Hadoop Sales Engineers only to lay them off in 5 months realizing that the product isn't selling.

So our Mr. VP still has his job and so do all the Hadoop Hunter managers. The same senior management is now seeking another $10MM from the CEO for the new so-called Open Source positions only to see them fail again in 6 months time. These executives take fun in playing with our lives. Personally I am okay but I know an engineer has a baby on the way, another person is delivering kids to college and so on but for those executives and managers, these are just Budget Games or SYA Games. What a shame!! Not a single manager in the hadoop hunter team got a notice, however all new technical folks who never got a chance to prove themselves are being laid off.

Way to go IBM. Investors better start shorting your IBM portfolios."
Client executive,3.0,"Nov 1, 2016","Current employee, more than 8 years",Company is trying to change to the moving market for more cloud computing and As a Service delivery model.  IBM is trying to hire new people from outside with fresh ideas and new skills.,"Senior leadership of the company does not appear to be connected to how their directions are being interpreted on the ground.  There is a gap between what the company is putting out on press and what's really happening in the company.  There are too many layers in the executive ranks, and it is contributing to poor execution of sales in key brands such as Watson and Cloud.

There is still some positive aspects of the culture left, although not nearly as positive as recent as 5-6 years ago because of short term focus by the lower to mid management.  Due to ongoing decline of revenue, the management culture has evolved into making decisions to make the short term numbers over doing the right thing long term.  This is sacrificing many client relationships & has damaged IBM's reputation.  The most recent reorganization to align by industry was a huge disruption of business and client relationships because IBM moved most of the sales assignments which meant loss of continuity and client relationships."

Excellent, absolutely amazing and very competent people are losing their jobs, without an opportunity to relocate withing the company.

Where's Jimmy?  Oh he's gone. We don't talk about him anymore....   :-(","This place is an oligarchical museum of fossils. Average IBM'er tenure is 20+ years. For most, it was their first job out of college and now it's 30 years later. Thinking out of the box is NOT celebrated. From management down, this place is a ""stuffy, fall in line and put on your IBM blue zuit suit a zip it kid atmosphere. Its the way we've always done it....kid. What would you know? I've been doing this for 30 years.""

As for mobility, it's the phone company. You'll move up when your boss dies. (I wish I was joking.)

Lastly, performance may or may not have anything to do with you being laid off from this place. You're just a number and that's the truth. There are teams of HR personnel that purge employees out of the company to beef up numbers for Wall Street. Don't believe me, google Watching IBM."

Most people are extremely helpful and service oriented.  Salary is competitive.","Very top heavy, especially in GBS.  In some areas of GBS, you'll have a VP, reporting to a VP, reporting to a VP and below them might be just 5 lower level employees.  Getting promoted in GBS is nearly impossible once you've hit a band 10 (which is lowest level of management).  Raises amount to 1% at the very most, if at all.  Annual bonuses are 1% to 2% at the most, if it all (but the ability to work from home with high productivity makes up for that).

They have a great program for workers who work out of the home.  This helps to maintain work/life balance.  IBM is very diverse, especially for a technology company.  Lots of women and minorities.  Nice to have name recognition among customers.  Everybody has some basic idea of what IBM is and what the company does.   From a sales perspective, IBM has broad coverage so you don't spend as much time on the road.  This also helps with the work/life balance.","Large company with lots of red tape and time wasted with unnecessary tasks and training.  You sometimes get the feeling that you are a very small fish in a very large pond (and you are).  The training that you are required to take often has nothing to do with your job, but is required.  The company is definitely run by ""bean counters"" so they can be very cheap at times - especially in regards to travel and expenses.

Many key ""implementers"" (the real 'talent'), are billed on an hourly basis to clients and have absolutely no time to share their knowledge; far too many managers protect their turf and staff may literally be held back from changing positions. True Leadership is hard to find; most are ""playing the game."" Too many employees are aging, old, outdated, and just show up for their cheese until they can go home. Real innovators seldom stay as they get tired of being surrounded by drones - and again, real talent is too busy for anything but taping things together to get our products to work at the customer's site. Most employees there really want to do well, but need real management and support; instead they get too much management and tons of politics that have little to do with their job."

I am on a great team of software developers, UX designers, testers, and writers, and have a very good manager; not all are as lucky as I am. 

IBM is an extremely competitive company. You MUST work hard, innovate, and research to keep your skills fresh and meaningful in this culture. IBM's mantra is ""Think"" but it might also be ""Learn"" because you've gotta keep your skills current while looking to the next trend.","IBM has had 3 terrible financial years. They are now selling off divisions to off-shore companies. They are not hiring at all, except possibly Sales positions. From what I've read in the news, they are preparing to lay-off 30k people this year. They are investing a lot in Watson, but there's no app or interface or software to go with Watson, so how will the big data/cloud initiatives work with third-party data? Who knows? It's all pie in the sky (literally, with cloud) right now. IBM has fallen behind the times and is now selling off they're people (talent) to offshore companies. A company won't go too far without great talent. So sad to see!"
Data architect,2.0,"Jul 24, 2017","Former employee, more than 8 years","Some great services - like an internal market for used equipment, some great training is available, and the company does enough things that one can laterally move around within.","There's a disparity between HR's work-life-balance statements and the reality of many teams.

There's about 14 levels of management, so most people lose track of customers & competitors and just get lost in the bureaucracy:  really great solutions to problems get sidelined in favor of the most politically advantageous solutions - even if they'll obviously fail.  Most management is so far removed from customers that they consider their competition the guy down the hallway rather than Amazon, Google, etc.

And they've acquired an immense staff of mediocre talent: most of their programmers are not very good, most of their 'subject matter experts' aren't.   Every year they identify top technologies to focus on, and an enormous number of people suddenly re-brand themselves as expects in this technology and all their projects are suddenly re-branded as about this technology.   Anyone that questions this, like ""do we really think that sidelining most projects in favor of building marketing in virtual worlds is going to work?  especially after every one of these initiatives over the last ten years has failed?"" And they just get blank stares.

And all this bureaucracy pushes out the best talent.   What's left these days are mostly mediocre staff that are over-worked,  afraid of being laid-off, and protective of their turf."
Customer service specialist,1.0,"Jan 15, 2019","Former employee, more than 1 year","Flextime, remote, lots of resources","Companies fancy they can concentrate on their core competence by outsourcing IT to IBM and along the way save big money (mostly cost cutting).  IBM retains original IT employees for a year to two then most of them are laid off after doing knowledge transfer to overseas and regardless of seniority (from prior host company) get one month of pay severance.  The reason you are outsourced to IBM in the first place is because of cost and the reason IBM removes you from that client is also because of cost not because you are underperforming.  In order to be profitable, IBM can't be keeping and paying the same number of people right?  Because everybody at the top wants to be more  profitable and got his or her year end bonus.  You are encouraged to look for other positions within IBM, personally I haven't known anyone who successfully landed another position for any meaningful length of time, like longer than three months.  Once you are on the bench and don't have a client you are underperforming as you don't generate any income for IBM and your performance appraisal would state just that now it's kind of your fault and a very good reason to get laid off . . . .  The way I see it most application support jobs are outsourced as the pay there is like 1/3 of what the US pay is.  Judging from the reviews here there are lots of good happy IBMers.

A bad manager, and your life can be miserable. employee morale is usually low, at least in my area, because we don't feel our jobs are secure (due to globalization and layoffs) and people feel pressure to work overtime. Sometimes it seems that IBM consists of a bunch of little fiefdoms with little communication between them. Also, some way-up corporate layer makes ""money-saving"" decisions that often winds up lumping way too many projects under a first or second line manager, giving them little room to devote necessary resources or energy."
Staff software engineer,3.0,"Dec 28, 2008",Former employee,"IBM has a great reputation. The company has a long and deep history in the computing hardware and software industry.  Working at IBM as an engineer, you have the opportunity to work with a lot of smart and talented people and you have access to the latest technologies and information. Company also has a good benefits package and average or above salaries.","Being the size that it is, political and networking skills are as important ( perhaps even more important ) than technological skills. Do not depend on management to outline a career path, you are on your own. Low-level managers are generally too busy answering to their managers to help employees. Also remember that profit is number one at IBM. This company is about making a dollar first and how to use technology and current trends in the pursuit of that goal. IBM is first and foremost a business. This may be a good company for an MBA, not necessarily for an engineer. 

Specifically as a staff software engineer, some of the downsides are long hours, little input to the decision making process and little consideration for work/life balance. Remember, it's a privilege to work at IBM !
( OK, yes, I'm a little bitter. )"
Advisory software engineer,3.0,"Jan 31, 2012",Former employee,There is some good technology for a software engineer. However that technology is getting dated very fast. It is a good company to be in if you have some manager or lead associated to your job title.  Managers and architects and leads do reap benefits of raises and bonuses. Financially company always makes profit.,No job security for US employees. Pay raise and bonus for technical engineers are almost non existent. If you are technical person be prepared to be abused especially if you are working in the US. Long hours with little or no recognition for work is standard practice. Especially in the software business unit. Technical growth opportunities just do not exist. Every year middle and upper management is looking to see how much of the work done in their groups/orgs in the US can be shipped and outsourced to India or China. The companies financial profits result in bonuses and raises only at the top.
Enterprise architect - technology,4.0,"Feb 6, 2012",Former employee,"Education is required, supported, and is cutting edge. Access to industry information and research is highly valuable and transferable to future employment. Corporate and divisdional goals are clearly articulated at the beginning of each year, although they frequently change dramatically from one year to the next.","IBM makes no secret that they are moving thousands of jobs overseas. In order to stay under the radar they are accomplishing this in increments of under 1000 people at a time. The IBM infrastructure is impossible to gain proficiency in navigating: long time veterans have trouble finding out 'where to go or who to talk to'.  Benefits have stagnated over the years and the huge number of retirees draw on IBM revenue. IBM's research is cutting edge, but the generally do not execute on trillion dollar ideas. When IBM lays people off, they target the most senior and highly paid employees. It is common that layoffs include 30 year veterans who have had incredible success at adding value to IBM and increasing IBM revenue: these people are shell-shocked and blind sided when they get word their job has been offshored."
Software engineer,2.0,"Sep 8, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years","Telecommuting, flex-time, good pay in otherwise bleak-employment towns.","The few of us who remain in the U.S. with IBM feel as if we are on death row.  It's just a matter of time before the remaining jobs are yanked or outsourced, even on our award-winning, profitable product.  We are bleeding people left and right as they leave voluntarily for more modern-day companies.   Everyone else is left holding the bag, adding to the 3-5 jobs they already do.   Management views us as cattle or robots, interchangeable and instantly producing equal output to the person who left.  Backstabbing and snitching is encouraged and even demanded by management, so that they can continue to downgrade and lay off otherwise productive and competent workers. The outsourced workers might earn less, but they also work far less than the U.S. employees.  US has to cover for the incompetence and laziness of many overseas, unionized workers.  Few skills are transferrable in the real world, other than perhaps in another bureaucratic nightmare.  I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy."

- Lack of junior support on most teams. You'll have director-level and lead-level employees stretched thin because they're still doing the same responsibilities even after they're promoted
- Some department execs are lifers (20+ years) which is good and bad. They know the inner machinations, but also tend to be less risk averse or have limited understanding of how marketing happens outside our company

Manager,3.0,"Mar 27, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years","Like may large corporations IBM is no different it is very easy to either get lost in the crowd and be paid for the 40 hours you expect to commit, or you can work hard and quickly be recognized for your contributions. The time off is great overall, you essentially have 3 weeks of paid time off, and have the option to choose which holidays you take off.","First and foremost when being offered a salary consider the fact that at most you will receive on an annual basis a 4% increase, and that is if you are part of the top 1%-5% of employees. I suggest you ask for a salary you will be comfortable with for the next 3 years. It is also extremely political, and will overwork and undervalue their hardest working employees. I was essentially promised a role when I first moved into management, leading other departmental managers.

Day 1 will be very important for you, as you could get placed in a good or not so good department.  Roles open up all the time because the turnover is very high. You will probably get a second role around your one year mark (probably no pay increase).  Work life balance varies from role to role greatly.  If you are unlucky you will get one of the roles that require 65+ hours/ week, and can easily get paid the same as a person who works 30.  You could get a few days of relevant role training, or a month depending on if the person training you is still there.  Higher up people in COE will tell you their success stories from being in the COE.  I have only heard success stories from people who left IBM, or are way older and were there before COE started, so they were already at the top."

They will allow senior leadership who got IBM into this sticky situation to keep their jobs and lay off entire analyst start classes hired directly out of undergrad.

Don't expect a bonus over $2,000. This means that even if you have a perfect rating at the end of the year, you are only worth $2,000 more to IBM than their employees who have average or below average ratings. Are all of those 80+ hour weeks grinding worth it? Probably not at IBM. Not to mention that annual raises will always be below inflation.. 

Poor culture. You have to be in the ""cool kids club"" to be part of any strong culture here or to expect any recognition.  Otherwise, expect to work long and hard hours with little recognition."
Project manager apprentice,1.0,"Mar 30, 2020","Former employee, more than 1 year",Good learning opportunities if you network well with other employees and search for applicable classes online.,"Terrible lack of involvement of management structure with little to no guidance given about the apprenticeship or completing it's requirements. The mentors were assigned but given no instruction or incentives to teach, often treating apprentices as secretaries, handing off their menial administrative tasks or refusing to put in any extra work to teach them at all. All the education and experience received was gained by networking with project managers other than my mentor and were hours I volunteered to complete on top of my regular account work, which I received no extra pay for but was working or studying up to 80 hours a week. My Front Line Manager was constantly on vacation or working from home and never addressed any of the issues or concerns that were raised about the apprenticeship. One mentor scolded or talked down to me regularly, so loudly, that multiple employees could hear and expressed concern about. However, when this issue was brought to my manager, I was treated as though I was the problem and forced to give justification as to why I should not be treated with such disrespect. Since the apprentice salary charges educational hours to IBM rather than individual accounts, they are assigned to accounts that are overburdened or maxed out on hours to be used for free labor and after the apprenticeship, any jobs offered were not market salary rates and were barely even above current earnings."

There certainly is a lot of opportunities for career, education and personal growth within IBM, the number of programs out there for employees is huge, sometimes that is also the problem.  With IBM there are times where you feel like a number.  Currently IBM has approx. 400K employees and sometimes you feel like a very small piece of that number other times when all is going well and your management team supports and publicly recognizes you and or your work it seems much smaller.  Overall the combination of salary, benefits, flexibility, employee development programs and stability are all reasons to work for IBM if you can get beyond being a number.","Breaking into management is difficult, even if you have talent and competency to become a manager sometimes you get overlooked because the hiring managers already have someone in mind and are only going through the motions of a job posting/interviews before officially giving the job to their person.

Like in the other post, there are times where being one of 400K can seem overwhelming and you feel small and overlooked by being so large.  The key is to getting an excellent manager to support you and to be passionate about employee development otherwise you will get lost in the shuffle."
Senior engineer,5.0,"May 10, 2009",Current employee,There are a few. The technology is great and the people who I have worked with are great team players. The assignments have been very challenging which I believe have helped me in achieving my career goals. My management team allows me to use my creativity in accomplishing my assignments. They continue to apprise me of IBM related issues and progress which has made me feel like part of the team. They have also given me time off for personal issues and have demonstrated their compassion to my needs. All in all this has been a great group of people to work for and with. My salary has grown through the years and I am comfortable with it's growth. My family and I feel great full for having the opportunity to work for IBM for these 30+ years.,The only downside I can think of is the changes of the medical plan. Although IBM never promised me free medical coverage it still continues to increase from year to year. The other area where they could use some improvement is in all of us who reach the qtr century club. It would be nice to honor this in a more thank full way. Other than that I am happy with the company.
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Oct 21, 2009",Former employee,"Internet Security Systems was an amazing place to work.  IBM Internet Security Systems is not.  There are some distinct perks to working at a company like IBM, though.  For one thing, it seems to be easy to get lost in the shuffle and get by doing the bare minimum, collecting a salary for not a lot of effort.   Also, the benefits package is unparalleled in the IT business - assuming you're a blue-badged employee, of course.   They have the best teleworker infrastructure and culture of any company in the world, hands down.","ISS division management seems to be bent on running the product (as opposed to service) side of the business into the ground.   Jobs are being outsourced left and right, almost entirely to barely-competent engineering teams in India, and product quality has suffered The IBM bureaucracy makes it impossible to get anything done in a reasonable (and commercially-meaningful) amount of time.   If you don't like concalls, you'll HATE working for IBM.   The robust teleworker culture means that physical facilities are VERY badly neglected - I've visited dozens of IBM office during my time there, and never saw one that didn't look run down."
Software engineer,2.0,"Apr 3, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","The pay is not bad, nor are the benefits. IBM does not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment at the workplace. For the most part, my first-line managers have been people-oriented and tried to look after their employees. The company works on a wide variety of things, and it is sometimes possible to move around to different areas if you want to try something new.","Working at IBM is something like an eternal game of Russian roulette, except with layoffs instead of bullets. I survived the layoffs for almost 20 years, but eventually my luck ran out (despite never receiving a bad rating). I am still with the company as of now, but my last day will be in the next 3 months. I have seen this happen to very talented employees many times during my years at the company. The layoffs are often determined by what project you happen to be working on at the time that the layoffs are done, rather than being determined by your skills or value to the company. 

Up until recently, IBM was very good about giving employees the flexibility to work from home or even to work purely remotely from other cities. Recently it was announced that this policy had ended and all employees were expected to be on site for all working hours. For some employees, there was no local IBM office where they could work. Those employees were told they would have to relocate closer to an IBM office or they would not be able to stay with the company. This was another case where very talented employees were essentially forced out of the company.

For the past 10-15 years, it seems like the company tries to reinvent itself and entirely change directions every couple of years. But IBM never sees any of these strategies through. It tries them briefly, and if they do not pay immediate dividends, something new is attempted. On top of this, IBM has had a habit of always being late to the party. Only once cloud computing was well-established by IBM competitors did IBM start trying to get into the market, for example. It is very frustrating as a worker to feel like the company has no real direction or sense of strategy.

It also often feels like the executives making the strategy decisions are too far removed from the reality of the business. IBM has many layers of management between the regular employees and the executives that make the decisions.

Finally, and I imagine this is probably true of many large corporations, IBM treats its employees in a very schizophrenic manner. When a project is behind schedule or high priority, IBM management tells its employees that we are a family, a team, and we all should pull together, work extra hours, go the extra mile, etc, to see the project to completion. However, when IBM decides that they need to cut costs, they'll have one of their frequent layoffs (except they will only refer to them as ""resource actions"", the same way downsizing to them is ""right-sizing""). And when the layoffs happen IBM management makes it clear that this is a business and these things happen. Wait, what happened to being a team and a family?"

The pay and benefits are good.  The company seems serious about balancing work and family time, although like any high tech company, there are times when the job can become all-consuming.  The sheer size and aggregate capabilities of IBM's employee base is staggering... when they are applied effectively.  Few companies can attack problems of the scale that IBM can.  Several times in its history, IBM has re-invented itself to adapt to changing business and technical circumstances.   Overall, it seems like a good place to work.","As might be expected for a company the size of IBM (390,000 employees at last count), there is a large amount of bureaucracy and bureaucratic thinking.  Often the bureaucracy can create barriers to innovation, which leads to stagnant product releases.  Upper management is very focused on hitting short to medium term financial goals, which although positive in many ways (challenging employees to think creatively) also leads to making some business decisions that are good in the short term but not in the long term.  Basically, IBM's sheer size is both its greatest asset and the greatest challenge faced by prospective employees."
Software engineer,3.0,"Mar 8, 2012",Current employee,"100% matching 401K contributions.
Use of leading edge technologies and tools.
Flexible working arrangements.
Great experience in working with highly skilled and knowledgeable technical professionals.
Pride of working for a renowned and respected technological giant. When you mention you work for IBM, people automatically respect you and treat you differently, in a postive sense.","Too many processes and inefficiencies to get the simplest task completed.

While the working arrangements can be flexible (depending on your manager), there is a lot of pressure to get work done even though there are limited resources available. If a team member retires, resigns (yes, that happens) or is ""resource actioned"" (i.e., laid off), IBM does not replace that member, and remaining team members are expected to pick up the slack.

There is no sense of job security, no matter how well an employee performs, or how well the division or business segment does in terms of generating revenue. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason to decisions to lay off an employee. I've have personally seen IBM lay off highly skilled, knowledgeable, positively-reviewed, and experienced employees, in very successful, revenue generating projects. 

Too many meetings. By the time I get out of meetings, almost the entire day is gone."
Advisory software engineer,4.0,"Nov 4, 2013","Former employee, more than 5 years","IBM has a huge support system for employees. If your goal is to climb the corporate ladder, IBM is very well set up for that, because of the strong top-down culture. Salaries are competitive. Details of the work are too specific to be useful for such a huge company, but IBM is very committed to their basic values, and is particularly customer focused.","The culture produces an explicitly zero-sum game, with battles over money and promotions. IBM's attitude towards money is extremely tight. Usually, interactions with upper management about money are negative; travel arrangements, office perks, etc. are all very closely controlled and costs are minimized. This tends to produce a less-than-enthusiastic response among employees, at least at the lab I was in. This is in stark contrast to newer companies (Google, Amazon) that are more bottom-up driven. IBM can be very stifling."
Senior manager,2.0,"Nov 13, 2013","Current employee, more than 5 years",IBM is a 100 year old titan with tremendous brand equity. I am a junior mid-career band 10 and the pay is good enough to keep you onboard...,"but not bad enough to force you to look elsewhere. The frustration, for me and I'm sure for gen x and y, is that IBM is:

a) too slow in allowing career path suggestion, meaning progression is directly correlated with tenure, not skills...and opportunities to move around the company are harder than people describe, where you can have many ""careers"" at IBM, but given the current climate and internal controls, it's harder than ever;
b) too many managers, very top-heavy, with many IBM lifers that are very talented and senior, but expensive to carry on the P&L, thus weighing down the company. IBM is quick to cut the tens of thousands of long-time professionals, but very hesitant to cut the thousands of long-time senior managers;
c) our size is our strength but it's also killing us in a world of cloud, we are mired with legacy contract vehicles, sales force (40,000 expensive F2F sellers, vs. self-serve salesforce.com-like inside sales model), and technology (lotus notes?)....all this baggage doesn't allow the faster portions of the company (usually via acquisition) to sprint as strongly as needed to compete as the gold standard...we have lost that status"
Director,1.0,"Jan 24, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years","Outstanding people, most leaders and executives (Directors and VPs) are reasonable, want to help clients and partners, and WIN for the company.  ""The world is your oyster"" ---- one of the most global companies, the exposure and experience you gain is incredible and eye opening if you do it right.  Great career opportunities due to the diversity.  Amazing client focus - IBM will go all out to ensure clients are successful, period.  There is never a waiver on this point through all facets of leadership, in my opinion.  If they screw up, they will in some cases blow millions of dollars to make it right.","Leaders & executives are handcuffed - they are asked to execute with legs chopped off.  Top heavy - far too many senior executives.  E/R is far too low to stay competitive.  Expectation to grow SaaS and Cloud revenue without development expense to build products for the future.  Expected to generate high profits in SaaS & Cloud on current products when no other similar firms attain similar metrics.  Unable to track basic SaaS metrics for success, such as churn and renewal rates.  Sales plans are stacked beyond belief leading to overpaid sellers who contribute nothing to the sales cycle.  Significant technical attrition, inability to hire replacement talent."
Staff software engineer,1.0,"Nov 8, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","Flexibility, good health coverage, not much else. Any top tech company can offer the same.","Switching roles, projects, or teams is impossible especially if you are good at what you do. Travel is almost next to none because only architects get to travel under Systems group. Any credit for what you do will go to a senior architect regardless of how much work you put in and how little work they put in. Its all about seniority, so learn to succumb to that. False promises is the norm at IBM. Forget about getting education or having IBM support going to get higher education because I've been in the list for 5+ years and still ""no funding"". Lowest pay among top tech companies by far. It is very political, if you are a new hire you do not get a pay increase or bonus in the first year because you are ""new"" or already got a signing bonus.... You can be the top performer and even outperform your peers that have worked there longer and still get nothing your first year. If you get a promotion or raise do not expect to get anything the following year because of the same argument as above. Learn to always be seeking for a new job because the only way to get a promotion or raise is via getting it yourself by forcing IBM to match another companies offer."

Advisory software engineer,4.0,"Jun 16, 2008",Current employee,"Large companies like IBM provide innumerable opportunities for career advancement and personal growth.  I'm happy with my compensation and I feel like IBM has good systems in place for employee feedback and review processes.  Also, I feel work/life balance is effective at IBM.  As less staff is asked to do more, management does appear more flexible on where and when that work is accomplished.","IBM is clearly extremely committed to moving all new staffing overseas to cheaper labor markets.  It makes being a US employee frustrating and causes continual staff paranoia.  US staff members are rarely replaced, and the existing US workforce is continually forced to do more with less.  Resource actions (forced headcount reductions) and department offshoring plans are constantly in progress, and it causes a constant unproductive rumor mill effect across all organizations."
Senior database administrator,2.0,"Jul 7, 2008",Current employee,"If you have an opportunity to work from home, then go for it.  If you can negotiate a salary you wish to keep forever, then by all means you should join Big Blue.   IBM benefits, while ever more expensive, offer some options like medical coverage which doesn't let insurance companies deny coverage for preexisting conditions.","IBM is not the same company I started at 10+ years ago.  Fair raises, even cost-of-living increases, do not exist.  All company focus is on getting offshore resources to do as much work as possible in order to replace US resources.  Benefit costs keep going up annually, actually outpacing our stagant salaries.  After 10 years, I have yet to be offered a single training class."
Senior it specialist,2.0,"Aug 26, 2008",Current employee,Work/life balance and work at home option are most likely the best in the industry providing for increase flexible home life and decreased expenses being able to avoid drives to the office and being able to eat at home office.  The pay from my research is near the top of the ranges for each job category and the potential for bonus (variable pay) and awards can be significant.  I've seen that there is alo great possibility for career growth & advancement (IF local management support it) and that is the biggest problem as some groups allow employees to transition to other areas and job functions and support education.,"HOWEVER, some divisions of IBM do not have the same level of education funding or management flexibility in growing employees and allowing them to move on.  The division I'm in has constant funding challenges and has laid off many US employees, but this causes management to not allow remaining employees to look elsewhere in the company for work or provide for any kind of education funding or time.  There is also increased use of Global Resources (offshoring), frequent layoffs, huge differences in culture and management handling of career growth and education.  The level of red tape and politics can be massive, but expected in such a large company"
It architect,2.0,"Feb 20, 2009",Current employee,"In IBM, you do have access to a large intellectual capital knowledge base and the people you work with are very smart.  If you manage to move from account to account, it allows you to see how many different companies work without the stress of having to find work on your own.  The higher you go up in the organization, though, you are expected to be a mercenary and find the work on your own.  You don't get the big bucks for nothing.","There is a constant pressure for cost savings.  In the US, labor makes up the biggest cost component and IBM has had a policy of micro-layoffs to stay under the public radar.  This occurs at the expense of employee morale and in some cases, customer satisfaction.  With the increased reliance on off-shoring to lower cost regions, US layoffs are going to accelerate.  On top of this, training is almost non-existent.  It's hard to justify 40 hours of training when you have a utilization target."
Inside sales,2.0,"Jun 17, 2009",Current employee,"Lots of a vacation: 15 days plus 4 ""personal choice holidays"", so basically 19 days of vacation to start with. The schedule is also flexible, if you need to work from another city or work from home to receive a delivery, it usually isn't a problem. Likewise, there are no set number of sick days: if you are sick, you don't come in. This also leads to you tending to work while you are out sick or on vacation (just a quick email check...), which skews your work/life balance a bit.","Upper management is completely disconnected from the ""grunts"". We are told to do things simply because they come from ""higher up"" than our first or second line manager, but these things are being done everywhere from Los Angeles to Smallville, Kansas. The country, states, and cities are not one-size-fits-all, but our performance is measured as such. Our pay, however, is not, so you need to balance time between the BS that doesn't help so that you keep your job, while still managing to finish what you would otherwise have gotten done so that you continue to get paid."
Managing consultant,2.0,"Jul 7, 2010",Former employee,"Large enough that regardless of what you have an interest in, someone, somewhere in the world, is working on it.  A good training ground for how to get along in a vast, global organization.","Easy to get completely lost in the maze of complexity and the bureacracy.  'Difficult to do business with' is consistently the number one complaint levelled against IBM by its customers, but it's exactly the same inside.  Their 'transformation' to a services company is a complete myth.  On the iside they still look and feels like a 70's something manufacturer."
Senior consultant,5.0,"Nov 19, 2012","Former employee, more than 3 years","IBM offers a wide-range of challenging work with many opportunities to shift laterally within the organization throughout your career. IBM is a great place to start a career because of the opportunity for recent graduates to work with Fortune 100 clients on high profile projects. The IBM culture is particularly collaborative as well. IBMers are generally very capable, smart individuals who work hard and are great colleagues. The best part of IBM are the IBMers who work there.","Progression and promotions can be a bit slow. IBM is careful to avoid promoting people too quickly and uses a variety of controls to ensure that only those who are already performing at the next level get promoted. For young talent this may be a drawback because advancement seems to be encumbered by bureaucracy. However, IBM is working to streamline these processes to make career development more flexible."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 2, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Smart! The average IQ of the company and ability to access big thinkers, new ideas and exciting innovation is everywhere....if you are willing to look for it.  The charTacter of most of the people is solid.  IBM cares about the customer and the client's success.  The products IBM brings to market are typically very good quality.   The overall culture of the company is good, laid back but professional....adult.","There are WAY too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  The company is so large and has so many Vice Presidents fighting for turf that the people who actually do the work, innovate, bring value to customers & make decisions are used until lost in the nonsense.  Middle management makes bad business decisions and manages people poorly due to short term thinking and self preservation.  The overhead of ""being a company"" has overshadowed the value we deliver to our customers. Different divisions don't work well together and are often working at cross purposes."
Senior managing consultant,4.0,"Dec 13, 2014","Former employee, more than 10 years",Excellent benefits and flexibility in scheduling.  The organization is adamant about supporting a diverse work force.  Large customer base provides a variety of consulting opportunities.  Many areas of technology to interest the most selective geek in each of us.,"Pay is decent but bonuses are insulting compared to similar organizations.  Many technical education opportunities provided, but personal education and tuition assistance are outright lies.  I worked for IBM for 14 years and I applied for tuition assistance to get a Masters.  I was always turned down because it was not ""required"" for my job.  I went to a new organization and was approved for assistance without even being asked about my current role.  Now THAT is how to treat someone who wants to improve themselves and the organization!"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jan 30, 2015",Current employee,"Good place to get training if you're straight out of college, especially if you are willing to travel.
Wide range of areas to choose from.","Upper management plays fast and loose with compensation.  Last year our ""Variable Pay"", which is supposed to be part of our salaries, was simply not given out because IBM didn't meet it's targets.  Also, the company has decided that their 401K match will not be given until the end of the year, so they have the use of that money all year long before they give it to us.   And if you leave before Dec 15 you don't get it at all. Seems like IBM is constantly trying to carve cost savings out of their employees.  This from a company I was happy to join 15 years ago because they really focused on our welfare.  I remember being told that we (the employees) are their most valuable asset.  Doesn't seem that way anymore."
Senior software engineer,5.0,"Dec 17, 2020","Current employee, more than 10 years","- large companies are known for their bureaucratic swamps that slow things down. IBM does a pretty good job of limiting this and allow you to do your job without all the micro-management. As a professional you are expected to do your job without requiring hand holding...I love this part of my job. 
- Excellent benefits
- Flexible work hours
- Collaborative environment
- Always innovative
- Many different kinds of career opportunities. More recently they are very receptive of allowing workers to move into other areas of interest. 
- Programs that support workers in many different ways all the way from career growth programs to mental health support. 
- Improvements in work/life balance. In the past, this was not always the case. I feel there has been major improvements in this area.

Business analyst,4.0,"Nov 3, 2008",Current employee,"IBM is a large and stable company , generally being smart about running its business . In the current macro economic environment , it is a big advantage . As industry growth is reversing itself , small companies are at risk of not making it to the other end of the tunnel . Management quality varies by division / department , but , in general , it is not bad . Work place flexibility is truly exceptional : many employees work from home ( if it suits them ) or go to the regular office only a couple days a week . It could be an enormous plus for some folks.","Being a large company also has its downside . It is difficult to grow the company of this size at a significant rate . Much of the growth therefore is done through acquisitions . This low rate of organic growth results in a few opportunities for a career growth as new management positions are not being created . This also gets exacerbated by many senior folks staying at the company for a long time resulting in a low turnover . Although , career growth might not be a high priority issue for the next few years as we are going through a tough economic stretch ."
Deskside support representative,3.0,"Dec 18, 2008",Former employee,"You get to say your work for IBM.  It's a large organization, and as such, their are opportunities for people who are good at knowing where to look.  I felt that at IBM I was given a lot of opportunities to get the job done and see firsthand what impact my actions had on the bottom line.  I worked with talented people who seemed happy to share their experiences with me, and to help me grow.  Being an IBMer does come with a sense of pride, and it's evident with almost everyone you work with.  My only regret is that i couldn't work for IBM longer.","It's a large organization, as such, small things you do, that are also good things, get overlooked.  A large portion of what you do at the company isn't determined by you at all, it's decided by people you've never met, and who've never met you.  I was a supplemental employee, who didn't get converted to full time status because my manager couldn't get financial approval.  What's interesting is to hear the same guy talking about the $14000 he just spent on business class plane tickets to go to India.  Thanks a lot pal, that was almost half my salary you spent on something you should have done with a phone call."
Senior software engineer,3.0,"Oct 11, 2011",Former employee,When times are good you can end up working on some of the most exciting and innovative stuff.  There are some really brilliant people at Watson research today.,"Research is now much more focused on funding than on innovation, with the result being that more and more focus is put on coming up with ways to make the current product portfolio stronger.  This is difficult, especially when you consider that the typical Research Staff Member is a Ph. D. with little practical knowledge of how the products are used, and with little to no access to customer feedback. This results in projects that are irrelevant to the product line or are redundant to work being done already by the product staff.  If you are not working on a project like this but something disruptive you often have to sell it to the people who are being disrupted (called ""finding a catcher""); oftentimes these people are so vested in the current product that they may spend their efforts killing your work rather than embracing it."

You also still find that you often work with some really outstanding people.","The concept of ""Respect for the Individual"", which guided the company for decades, has gone out the window.  An example is the changes to the retirement plan.  Pension was replaced by a 401K match years ago, which was actually good if you planned to stay a few years then move on.  But then instead of matching each pay period, they now make the payment at year end, so IBM gets the interest on the match, not you.  And if you leave, are laid off, or divested before December, IBM gives you nothing at all for that year.  Morale is also pretty low in the ""old"" businesses as the company continues to aggressively cut costs in its traditional business units."

Client representative,2.0,"Jun 25, 2008",Former employee,"The name. IBM carries a certain weight with it. IBM employees are usually well trained. IBM is a very good corporate citizen. I think you will find the public relations side very good. The benefits are better than most but declining quickly. It is very easy to call on customers when you drop the ""IBM"" name. IBM also has great products and advertising. It has always been a company of innovation. Although some may say it's too lage to be effective (I may agree). It is amazing that senior management can get 300,000 people pointed in the same direction each quarter.","Too much partisan politics, not enough time spent on winning in the market and helping customers. IBM by nature is a very political culture. So much, that I believe it get's in the way of being effective. The fifedon's that are often set up (ibm.com) are built around a smokescreen. Too many people spend far too much time in job justification or trying to build their empire rather than focusing energy on helping customers. If a large portion of your time is spent bulidng a beach head to avoid the axe, how much time can you really spend on gaining marketshare."
Consultant,3.0,"Mar 25, 2009",Former employee,"Because IBM is a such big companies, there are many other career opportunities within the company once you have a foot in the door. You can spend your entire career at IBM holding tens of positions. IBM also has pretty good benefits such as 15 days vacation days, 6 floating holdings in additional to federal holidays. Insurance plans are also better than many other big companies. 

If you are a slacker and want to be lost in a big ocean, IBM is also a place for you. I knew somebody who were on the bench for 6 months doing nothing and still had their job.","It's hard to be recognized for your achievements because it's so big and your manager has many too many direct reports. Many of your peers are incompetent professionals. If you are lucky, you will be staffed a project surrounded by great people whom you can learn from. However, most of time, especially in Public Sector, you will be staffed as a body on project that was set up to failed surrounded by slackers. 

Work life balance was very for me while working at IBM. For Christmas in a row, I had to work for releases schedule to go live in the week of January. 

I was in GBS SCM Public Sector."
Senior technical staff,4.0,"Jun 18, 2009",Former employee,"At its best, IBM is (was?...) a great place to work. You have the option to learn a lot, to stretch out of your comfort zone, to move to new jobs fairly easily, to work with great people, to do cool stuff. The level of knowledge and expertise available in the company is absolutely phenomenal -- the challenges are finding the knowledge, then 'drinking from the firehose' once you've found it.","At its worst, IBM can be mind-numbingly large, very slow moving, and often just plain stupid. It also appears to be moving in the wrong direction in terms of how technical people are treated. I worry that the ""Pros"" described above really only apply to the ""Old IBM"", the software, research, and (ever-shrinking) hardware divisions. The ""New IBM"" -- that is, Global Services, GTS etc., now more than half the company, and by far the majority of technical folks -- is a very different company. IBM Global Services has a crushingly unrealistic utilization metric, and a tendency to view technical talent as plug-compatible drones. Just hire what you need when you need it, fire them when you don't. As far as I can see, in the services side you *don't* get a chance to learn a lot, to stretch yourself, or to move from job to job easily. You are on your own to learn new skills."
Research staff member,2.0,"Sep 9, 2009",Former employee,"Company with a big name, looks good on your resume. Solid benefits, especially medical. Would help you with immigration issues (e.g., doing a Green Card for you), if it is required.","Huge bureaucracy. The company tries to squeeze more and more from its employees: most departments that I saw were understaffed and overloaded. The employee population is aging: fewer young people want to work at IBM. Too much management, too few people doing real work. The company has a very complex and burdensome work accomplishment/assessment yearly cycle, so that employees mostly think about how their yearly review will turn out. Hence a lot of time is taken by the efforts to make the review results look good, rather then solving the real problems. IBM T.J.Watson Research Center used to be a great research lab up until 2002-2003, now it more resembles a subsidiary of IBM Software Division, at best, or a bunch of software engineers used to be thrown to plumb holes of other division's lagging projects, at worst."

- Good vacation package","- Everything is procedural, presumeable so that anyone can do the task/job
- Little opportunity for promotion; if a promotion is given, must give a night shift employee the opportunity to replace you on day shift, and you go to night shift; only 3 technician levels, so one could spend an entire career in one level
- Work appraisals not fully based on merit, but fitted to a distribution curve that can change year to year; with 50% of the maintenance staff cut since 1993, can there still be 20% of the remaining techs rated 3?
- Once an employee reaches 50% penetration in the pay scale range for his/her level, raises become 2-3% every 2-3 years, if lucky
- Both morale and motivation are low; there is a huge distrust of management
- Jobs are being outsourced in almost every area"
Senior software engineer,2.0,"Feb 19, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years",IBM has/had a lot of great people who have passion for their work.  IBM is great at acquiring college talent via their Extreme Blue program but they cannot retain it.  Very flexible with work location and hours.,"IBM's 2015 stock plan has resulted in cutting top technical talent.  Executives are so focused on short-term earnings that they have sacrificed the future.  Innovation has grinded to a halt and most divisions are struggling to find the next big product.  Without a major change in leadership, the company is going to sink.  Top performers (top ~10%) were not given a raise two years in a row, sending a very clear message that talent can go elsewhere.

Over the last five years, here are some of the ""savings"" that were enacted: taking away free coffee, the ""adopt a plant"" initiative and removal of individual trash cans to minimize housekeeping costs, elimination of employee services and education center.  Worst of all, our 401k was changed to only vest in one lump sum at the end of the year instead of per paycheck.  If you leave before December, you lose anything you would have received.  They will slash anything or anyone regardless of the bigger picture.  It is very difficult to move internally and the employee rating system is broken."
Client services,3.0,"Jul 8, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years",Working for IBM has been interesting.  Some of the great things are the benefits and potential to move between different jobs.  There is a lot of opportunity to work with people from many diverse backgrounds.  The flexibility of the workday is also very nice for me.  I'm not sure if it is like that across the company or just within my area.,"I came to IBM through an acquisition which was very difficult.  My previous company had a very specific, ""start up"" culture that I miss immensely.  I feel like everything I try to do now is just met with red tape.  It seems through the acquisition management tried to appear to be transparent but it seemed to backfire as they sent so many lengthy emails trying to communicate things, that it no one had time to read and digest everything.  Additionally, it felt that no one really cared about us.  It was made clear that we are IBM and we need to work a certain way now."

I brought in big data and analytics skills, I got to apply them to small and  very large scale projects.  When digital came along I was an early adopter and evangelist.  Every new turn brings something new and challenging.  We are not the old Big Blue, we are enthusiastic about changing the world in new ways, and I have been delighted to be a part of it.  Where else would I work in a culture like this!","They are constantly reducing the workforce in North America and outsourcing to China, India, Romania and Latin America.

Coworkers all don't care, very few people actually have good customer service skills, customers complain about the product being garbage, management is complete garbage and not helpful at all, management also is shady that if there's a possible severe issue they have you lie to customers and stall on getting the issue fixed, level 2 just leaves customers hanging on the line while they go home, expectations are way to high and they know it just won't do anything about it, terrible hours, few people care about getting to the resolution in a timely manner, engineering/programmers are evil and don't do their job properly, unprofessionalism in the workplace is not a priority for management, and widespread intimidation and bullying is in full swing at merge."

Advisory software engineer,2.0,"Oct 6, 2008",Former employee,IBM has very diverse training available on-line.  Classroom courses can be taken but travel is usually restricted so this option may not be available.  The health benefits are good and vacation time and holidays are generous.  There is no set number of sick days.  There are numerous opportunities through the IBM Club to participate in other recreational and social activities.  Many employees can work from home.  One can have an office and work from home most of the time.  There are sports facilities at many of the IBM plant locations for employees to use.  IBM occasionally has employee social events.,Most IBM managers lack people skills and upward manage.  This means the management is mostly interested in what makes them look good to their boss regardless of the negative effect it has on their team's moral or lack of any benefit to customers.  The managers reward those that play the politics and appear to be supportive of them.  Many of these employees have become good at this while working only a total 20 hours a week or less from home.  Any employee who may suggest approaches to business objectives other than what their managers requested are thanked and then excluded from any future rewards.
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Dec 1, 2016","Current employee, more than 10 years","Vacation and Holidays, 401k match is pretty decent","Watch out for those folks touting Work@Home or Work from anywhere as a benefit.  Maybe employees are being forced to come into offices now and co-locate with teams or be out of a job.  IBM is in full assault mode when it comes to Work@Home and the powers that be have apparently decided that everyone should now be in the office working together as a team.  If you are thinking IBM is a great Work@Home option you are going to sorely disappointed as IBM reigns everyone back into offices and lays off people who took advantage of 'work from anywhere' and refuse to move.
The 401k match being paid at the end of the years is a cruel joke, not only to those who leave or are laid off before the end of the year, but also to current employees.  This one move has cost me tens of thousands in missed gains."

Typically the last ones to try anything new and cool. on the verge of being obsolete in terms of software offerings and research.
You cant just do good work and expect to be promoted, you need to work for the ""right"" people on the ""right"" projects, often grunge work to get recognized. Too many good people get overlooked while other unqualified people get fast-tracked in their careers. S/w engineers often switch to management path to get job growth as managers run the company rather than technical people. The technical career path is not as well defined as the management path is.
Pay is mediocre compared to other big companies in the area, top management rakes in big bonuses and stock each year while individual depts get tiny amounts to distribute as raises.. getting a 2-3% raise is considered as a big deal."

Though many jobs and people can/do easily make this target, some people have home lives they need to attend to and find it difficult to keep up with this average. In other words, there is NO reward or real motivation for finishing your work early - your reward is more work, and no extra bonus.  And, being promoted means a higher requirement of hours worked. This, for me and a few others I know, has quickly turned into burn-out an lack of interest in our work.

The IBM Club provides opportunities to network as well as provide work/life balance.  Most of my connections with IBMers are with people who were not in my department/project.

The ability to use flex time/telecommute is a real plus.  No fixed number of sick days - no, you can't have a cold for a month, but when you're sick, stay home (statistics say fewer sick days are actually taken with this policy).","The employee review process.  Instead of being rated against your own commitments, you're rated against your ""peers"" in your job band.  Many of these peers have different job responsibilities that aren't an ""apples for apples"" match.  You can meet all of your management approved goals for the year and still receive a low rating.  

The ""relative contribution"" element of the employee review creates competition among coworkers, and if business conditions limit the opportunities available on a project, senior engineers can further limit these opportunities by taking on tasks that lower bands could assume - they need to in order to improve their own ""relative contribution""."

Although management tries to balance the workload amongst the remaining employees, work hours are long. While employed there, maintaining the same quality took longer because of increased responsibilities, and thus I found myself at my laptop most evenings. I did carve out Friday night and Saturday for myself, but Sunday evening found me logged back in. 

Management tried to control costs through purchase and travel restrictions, but even though the SW division was quite profitable during 2008, over one thousand employees were handed walking papers so as to maintain a higher $ per share."
Software engineer,2.0,"Jul 14, 2012","Current employee, more than 10 years","The benefits are good and the base pay is decent when taking the benefits into account. Other than that, there is not much. One of the few perks that I do enjoy and would surely miss is that they still have actual offices for the majority of the employees. In a world where everything is cubicle, it is nice to be able to just close a door for a bit to get away from office noise and be able to concentrate on work.","Most folks know the cons: a process for everything, everything is politicized, movement and career advancement is difficult, the predominant focus now is on offshoring and having to interface with a revolving door of folks overseas. I see the company deflating its US-based workforce over the next few years by not providing incentives to new/younger employees and letting the older, more established employees leave as their careers end naturally. Internally there are a lot of 0-5 years and a lot of 15-20+ year vets. It is the in-between the IBM has failed to focus on and will likely face a lot of issues because of this in 5 - 10 years time when the majority of the vets retire."

IBM's strength is its people who generally go above and beyond to service their customers. IBM is a well run, progressive, highly ethical business that seems to always find ways to be successful from quarter to quarter.","Although IBM has excellent benefits, over the years they have diminished. Exempt employees are expected to work a minimum of 20% overtime with little or no comp time. Everyone is constantly expected to do more and more and many people are getting burned out. IBM has also been moving a large number of jobs offshore (India, Brazil, Argentina, etc.) and this puts additional burden on those who remain in the US to train and support the offshore resources. IBM has been moving a lot of its IT support to US Global Data Centers in Dubuque, Springfield and Columbia and a lot of the US jobs have moved to those locations. Recently IBM announced that there would be no salary increases this year in the Global Technology Division."
Senior financial analyst,2.0,"Jan 10, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","IBM is a good place to get your career started.
Given the breadth of IBMs business, you can get broad experience in technology if you move through software, hardware, and/or services. However, it will take several years to get valuable experience in more than one of those groups.
Compared to other tech firms, if you are a good performer, employment is stable in tough economic times.  They do lay-off, but tend to do a small number of pruning, vs. large reactionary layoffs.","It is bureaucratic.
Lots of room to grow for early professionals, but almost none for mid-carer and up.
Requires unhealthy dedication to get to upper employee bands or executive appointment. . . and as life goes, this coincides generally when people have small kids. So you choice is be a rockstar IBM employee, or have a family life whose main theme is your not around and your career is the central family priority.
Raises have never been good, but lately the average percentage for the finance organization is 1%.  So while they have a theory of meritocracy, if you only have 1% to divide up, it is hard to reward anyone.

- IBM Design has little practice in creating a working formula for designers to succeed in a completely developer driven culture.
- Management is a confused bunch of people that have a very hard time helping their team succeed.
- IBM Design studio in Austin, TX is way overcrowded. I am sure that they are not meeting fire code standards.
- Almost all products that you could work on are completely lame. Recruitment lies to your face throughout the process telling you that when being deployed onto a project they take what you would like to work on into consideration.
- 3 month Design Camp is like a shortened college class that you get paid for. This was extremely boring and monotonous. 
- Most importantly : as a designer at IBM Design you have very little say on the projects you are creating. Everyone in the studio puts on a daily happy face as they are all hating the projects they work on and trying to do anything to switch products.

Most managers are competent and take time coaching newer members of their teams. They do give you opportunities to work on other initiatives within IBM. For example, I have been able to help out with college recruiting.In addition, it is a fairly young company, in my experience at least. My first project was a good 30% people under 30 which makes the working environment that much more enjoyable and easy going. They hire very ambitious young employees too; adding to the fast paced work environment.","They do not reward business development for people at my level, i.e. 1-3 years experience. The pay for the new hires is great for the industry, but I came in before they raised the rates so I am playing some serious catch up to personnel 1 and 2 years younger than me. When you are a new hire you have to get on a long term project. Otherwise every time you switch to a new project you will be considered the new hire and be forced into doing mundane tasks for people even though you had already earned your stripes on a previous project you have to do it again."

Labor arbitrage is all it's about today, with the belief that you can get someone for the 1/2 the price to deliver the same business value.  There is veiled attempt to hide the arbitrage as 'globalization', but the execution of that globalization is terrible.  Processes are broken, turn-over of staff in growth markets causes inordinate amounts of issues and costs the business money. Staff in mature markets don't buy into the globalization effort as the case for their careers and growth is non-existent.  There are lots of words from the executive team, but no tangible action.  Even the growth market employees leave because they don't see what's in it for them as the arbitrage regularly chases the next cheapest source of labor."
Client representative,3.0,"Sep 19, 2011",Current employee,"IBMers are eager to help each other and share knowledge about best practices and how to be effective in your job role.  There is a culture of teamwork, where people will take the time to help even if they are not getting directly measured on the issue at hand.  IBM also have a good work/life balance where they promote working at home and managing one's own time as long as the job is getting done.

IBM management has done a very good job of adjusting the business based on the projections for the future coming out of research.  We spun off our PC business in 2004 (?), way before the PC market became soft, and invested in software products that help customers reduce their operating costs by ""doing more with less.""  These decisions have enabled IBM to grow revenue and profit in a tough economy.","IBM used to be a sales led organization. Now it is very much led by finance.  All decisions and systems that support compensation, expense, investment, etc. are designed to closely manage costs and tie the employees hands when it comes to travel, customer entertainment, sales commission/bonus, and other costs of doing the job."
Financial client executive,1.0,"Jan 17, 2015","Former employee, more than 10 years","Great training, ability to work from home and colleagues.","After working there for 20 years, I can honestly say in the last 15 years I have felt the company has changed to where you are just another number.  There are no raises, little bonus and most people are absolutely miserable.  The culture has become work as little as possible and wait to be laid off.  When I started with the company if you were a top performer you could get a 3-5% raise and a 15-21% bonus with average performers getting a smaller raise and 8-12% bonus.  Now only the top 5% get little to no raise and 3-5% bonus.  Everyone else gets nothing.  They also have a mandatory bell curve for performance ratings which ensures on 1 -2 people (5%) get a bonus or raise.   It is no surprise that companies with great cultures like Google, Apple, and others have increased their stock while IBM hasn't changed much over the last 15 years.  The bottom line is management doesn't care about the employees and the employees know it and therefore don't care about the company or its performance. 

ABSOLUTE MUST:  If you are about to take a job with IBM, you need to negotiate the highest salary possible because this will be your salary for the next 5-10 years."

Yes, IBM is truly global and there are lots of good things about being part of a truly global company -- there are many opportunities to be part of global projects that stretch you as a contributor and virtual team member.

Smart People
You get the opportunity to work with a great group of really smart people at all age levels -- good opportunities for mentoring and idea sharing.","Figuring IBM out
You're ""living in the matrix"" big-time. Which means for new hires, it could take a while to figure out how to get the most out of the organization or how to grow within the environment.  Some folks may not have the patience for that.  

Dealing with big changes
IBM is in the midst of another generational transformation -- trying to reposition hundreds of thousands of personnel quickly and effectively is quite a challenge -- you have to be nimble and flexible with the directional changes that will continue into the future."
It specialist,2.0,"Oct 10, 2015","Former employee, less than 1 year",IBM offers a large selection of web-based training.  It is also nice to have the option to work from home.,"No matter how highly you are rated or how many years you work, do not think for one minute that your job is secure.  A large number of my peers and I were just laid off, so they can move our work to India and pay a fraction of our salaries.  If you are laid off before the end of the year, you get screwed out of the company matching 401K funds.  No respect or value to employees is shown.  In fact, IBM will not release any information on how many jobs are outsourced per year, but the number of U S employees is definitely going down.  Finally, there are too many layers of management.  If they want to save money, this would be a good place to start."
It architect,2.0,"Oct 30, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years","All depends on division and people you work with. Global Services is fine if you are young, don't mind traveling all the time, and want something big to put on your resume. Your career won't be long there unless you stay billable, which doesn't allow you to take the vacation you earn. So there is a tipping point if you take you alloted vacation you can't make the 98% billable target and will be an underperformer.","Most jobs shifting to India, actually most of the company resides outside the US at this point. Current executive management is pretty inept as reflected in the stock price over the time she has been in charge, but there is little movement to address this situation. The sole priority at the company, despite all the mission statements and values documents, is the shareholder value. So take everything with a grain of salt. As an individual you are of little value. Also disregard any promises of bonuses. They either never make their numbers (not in 18 years) or if there is any money it is divided up not by your work but by a comparison of your work to people you have nothing to do with.  Real number are 2% or less on a good year."
Global project manager,1.0,"Aug 20, 2016",Former employee,"I wasn't there long enough to provide any pros. If I were on a different account, I might be able to provide some pros since I do know that IBM works in so many ways around the world.","IBM decided they wanted this particular global conglomerate's business.  This is a network of advertising agencies.  The agencies certainly are disparate in their IT infrastructure and standardization throughout the agencies would certainly be advantageous.  Unfortunately, they bit off far more than they could chew.  For example, they can barely say the word ""Macintosh"" let alone work with tens of thousands of them throughout the world - a critical element to any agency.  

Basically boils down to a poorly managed account takeover in an area they have little knowledge.  Some of my colleagues would say it seems they have completely forgotten about the ""human"" element in business.  I like to say they feel like the Borg from Star Trek.  There is absolutely no way they can standardize the goal agency network with limited knowledge of agency operations.  

A final blow to this is the fact that IBM took the slash and burn technique to most of the IT people they took over and decided to save the client money by laying off most of the most important people with knowledge that IBM would eventually need to actually be effective towards standardization.  They then replace these positions with sub-standard backfill employees that have, perhaps, 1/10th of the knowledge required to transform the network.  (also at minimum pay)"

The executive management team has created a culture which is ""desperate"" and does not value previous contributions.  It is strictly ""what can you produce this cycle"".   Many strong leaders are jumping after 20+ year careers to join other SW companies.  They see the writing on the wall.   Sadly employees are routinely fired or laid off if they cannot meet the numbers.  The question of whether the number are realistic or if the strategy is sound it not addressed.    The overriding message from the top has been to clean out the  >40 crowd in favor of young, new hires.   The amount of tribal knowledge being shown the door is shocking."

Training for some products, even though they sell and maintain them, are out dated and makes the consultants job very challenging to service their clients.

Most often a consultant would have to learn on a clients environment during an engagement.
CLIENTS: This is why you experience the challenges you do! It's not the consultants fault. They beg for the tools and knowledge to service you better.

You don't hear IBM go crazy with new ideas everyday, because they don't do that. Decisions are made only after going through a maze of hierarchy and bureaucracy and you, as a regular employee, constitute an extremely tiny piece of this huge company. If you do not go up the corporate ladder (which is a pretty hard thing to do at IBM), then you are very much replaceable by just about anybody else. You may feel that at an entry level job, you are small, and--to avoid saying unimportant--of little importance to the overall being of the company.

There are very very bright people that are working very hard to pull this off.","The trick is to find, understand, get in tune with, imbed oneself in the right projects with the right people, that are in the forefront of where IBM is headed.  That can't be done by oneself - you have to know (or be taught be those who do know) where to look.

For someone that is a go-getter, it is not a hard place to impress management, build a network internal to IBM, move around to new roles that better suit your interests, and generally excel. There is also a culture of acceptance that there are people who ""just do their job"" for their entire career, and while this seems like a negative thing, I think this balance of proactives and stagnants creates for a harmonious work environment unlike the vicious/toxic environments that are so present at many other highly competitive tech companies.","IBM loves to build tools in house, while they have recently started to branch out, there is always ""a tool that IBM owns"" that was written back in the stone age that is free and they force their employees to ""make it work"".

You won't have their impact.

Workplace is dull and tired. Terribly designed office, despite the aim of the organization it supports. Most startups with mediocre incomes can support better perks, benefits, salaries... and cool projects. Some IBM offices are thrilled to offer free coffee for an hour a day! Meanwhile smaller companies offer free lunches, gym memberships, cleaning services, and higher salaries. Don't sell yourself short on a nice interview dinner.

Austin is great, but Texas is only for some. Don't move here from a big city, unless you're looking to settle down.

The management is more of a survival class than a meritocracy. Most people expect respect because of how long they've lasted, not because of what they can do — that makes for a corporate culture that is overwhelmed with bureaucratic, safe, risk-averse behavior and very little desire to follow even brilliant design ideas.

You will not learn the art of selling here - Enterprise deals are done at the end of the year and negotiated over steak dinners.  Customers spend 8 or 9-figures, are happy with deep discounts and don't really know what they're buying - just that they're getting a good deal.  Most product is never used and your commission is based not on what you actively sold - it's based on what someone decided your % of the overall deal is.
Benefits are terrible (and getting worse every year) vs. the best available from leading Tech companies - the only people who say they're great are the 10+ year relics who are buying the party line that ""Big Blue is a great place to work"".  Maybe it once was, no longer.

It's about spending as little as possible even if it means laying off everyone over 40 and replacing them with fresh graduates.  

IBM are famous for their 'resource actions' or massive layoffs.  Severance packages used to include one week pay for each year of company service.  They cut that down to a max of 30 days no matter what.  I guess that makes it cheaper to lay off folks with decades of dedication.

With the increased outsourcing of Sr./Jr. technical positions overseas, the accounts are very short staffed, and lack the technical expertise to properly support the associated accounts.  This has lead to the thought process of ""Quantity not Quality"".  The US will continue to suffer, as large companies like IBM, continue to take advantage of their employee base, and continue to reward their management base through cost savings.  This philosophy continues to erode the company’s ability to function efficiently and fosters anamosity towards upper management.  If you are seeking a career with “Big Blue”, and you are a top performer, look elsewhere.  If you are the individual who like to: push all responsibilities to others, do not want any accountability, willing to work only 30 hours/week (from home), have no technical knowledge or skill, willing to agree to anything that comes across your desk (even if that product isn’t concieved), and exhibit that outstanding concept of, “It’s a large company, I can hide anywhere.”  IBM has Senior Management position waiting for you.

Poor execution by Sales Management, with no regard to customers or their relationships with IBM teams.  Constantly being moved from developed or developing relationship to build new with solutions that have long sales cycles. Products removed from seller's bag, leading to loss of earnings (but expected to help close business, and to perform in the new territory), building and re-building relationships with customers which aggravates customer and extends sales cycles, effecting compensation (positively for those who follow pipe builders, negative for those leaving behind opportunities and gaining poorly executed territories).

Change is necessary, but have had 2 major shifts in 6 months leading to the worst year of my record (even though the territory I left is having a break-out year).  Now the organization is firing for non-performance...which has never been a problem for me until this year's multiple changes.  Very scary place to be even for a top performer.

I think folks that started 30 years again got a good run, but even the old folks say its not the same anymore. They off shore their internal support, so you have an issue with your local computer you get to call India, and then they dispatch someone locally to come look at it because 9 times out of 10 they don't know how to fix issue or can't because you physically need to fix problem."
Advisory software engineer,3.0,"Apr 7, 2014","Former employee, more than 10 years","IBM offers fair salaries, acceptable benefits, reasonable (but declining) vacation time, and a huge internal network to explore positions. There are some very bright people who work for IBM, and they are an inspiration for what is possible.","Morale is generally in tatters after years of offshoring and 'Resource Actions' (euphemism for layoffs). My team went from 9 people eventually to 4 with no change in total workload. Reductions only take into account short-term company bottom line, not quality of work that can be produced, and cut decisions happen at such a high level that I've seen very valuable people eliminated.

Culture is often tied up in older ways of doing things (""Because that's how we've always done it!""). New ideas are welcomed, but rarely acted upon, or take years to make even minor changes.

Shifting positions internally is often difficult as employees with seniority tend to just...stay in one position, leaving no room for advancement without drastically shifting teams."
Senior software engineer,1.0,"Jan 30, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years",Large enough to facilitate broad career exploration.  As an IBMer you have an opportunity to try an array of different career venues.  The continual professional education is great.  The benefits however are marginal ompared to other industry leaders.,"This IS NOT the 'Big Blue' your parents knew, and their parents before them....  This is a hybrid of ""exceed at any cost"" (even at employees expense) and once on top, ""stay on top at any cost"" - again, often at the employee's expense.  I have been with this company over 27 years; have seen it expand and contrast with market fluctuation and can say with certainty - borne out of experience,  this is the worst it has ever been.  

For the young talent out there.... DO NOT consider this a company you will retire with but rather one that is a good start and building of skills then, port your skills over to a company that will invest in YOU.  IBM will NOT invest in you, instead they use ever last ounce of your talent, work you 70+ hours a week - then eventually seek to remove you in someway when management no longer has a use for you.  THAT is the new IBM way.... I am still here but leaving soon and want to impart my wisdom to anyone thinking of joining this company. I would recommend you speak wit a few old timers first...."
Business analyst/sme,3.0,"Apr 21, 2015","Current employee, more than 5 years","Lots and lots of access to smart people - smart meaning a deep skill set and / or a good understanding of how to maneuver within the company. Lots of opportunity to move to a different job role or geographic location. I would recommend IBM to some people, for others not so much. It really depends on your personality and your approach to work.","Machine culture isn't very personable. Employees are treated like machines. The employees who succeed here (and there are many who do) do so because they know how to set boundaries and advocate for themselves and their human-ness aggressively while still being professional. An example of setting a boundary and being a self-advocate would be letting management know that you are not willing to work more than 55 hours a week for a 40 hour a week paycheck, and getting away with that. Another con - once you're in the door your salary will not increase for years. If you come in at a high salary in an expensive market (like Manhattan or San Francisco) and then move to a cheaper housing market (Alabama for example), you can come out ahead."
Program manager,3.0,"Jul 21, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","Smart co-workers, some interesting projects, new technologies, IBM's leadership in the P-Tech program and mentoring opportunities","Years of poor results, layoffs and not valuing employees has resulted in a negative culture.  The environment is challenging as there is lack of trust and politics as people fight to keep their jobs.  There is a lack of respect for experience at IBM and many people are new/limited experience with a huge learning curve.   One of the main benefits of working at IBM was the work/life balance due to the flexibility to work from home.  That has now been taken away with co-location.  Even if you don't have to move, people have long commutes most days which adds to an already long and stressful workday."

Corrupted management (95% of them) that is only there to protect their managers even if the manages are in violation of company code of conduct. HR is the most evil, shameless and unethical team I've ever experienced. They'd lie to your face, re-define ""retaliation"" and ""discrimination"" to defend for their managers who are at fault. They even went above and beyond to delete record in SalesConnect hoping you cannot prove they are wrong.  Tons of employees over  age 50 got let go,  nickle and dime with employees' benefit, for example, they only match your 401K once a year on 12/15 each year, for those who left before 12/15, will not get a penny! Very few good, ethical or competent  leaders, tons of managers whose only leadership skills is threatening your employment since they simply cannot lead.

To make things worse the ability to grow is stifled by the constant disorganization and constantly changing  requirements to get promoted.

The push for training is constant but the ability to apply any of the skills are nearly nonexistent.  Recruiters will lie vigorously and substantially to get you here and then your stuck.

- Tons of great communities full of people who share similar passions. Great places to connect with other IBMers from around the world who share the same interests (hobbies, crafts, etc) as you do. 

- Good pay; Competitive, and above average. 

- Lots of opportunities and incentives to work on skills that lead to promotion.","- Depending on your team, you may have meetings either very early in the morning or very late in the day. This is due to the global nature of some teams.

- Dental Benefits could be better. Little coverage for 'major' surgeries.

- Requirements for moving up the band system are defined too broadly. For example, there are docs and even badges for ""Software Engineer"" career paths, but there is no distinction between Cloud engineers and Z (Mainframe) engineers, even though the type and scope of work is vastly different between them."

IBM is known beyond the technical market segments - which makes it easy to explain to people where I work....The benefits are solid, particularly the 401K plans.  I have worked with California based companies that provided significantly better and less expensive health care options. IBM management is pretty comfortable with acceptable levels of performance - that is - it's not necessary to really excel in the environment to stay under the radar.  Many times management has to be reminded of greater goals than simply reporting on revenue results. When things get tight management is happy to say ""We are a $95B dollar organization""....","Inside baseball.  Many employees have been in the organization over 20 years.  Generally, the expiriences are not applicable in their current positions. In many ways IBM's strategy appears to be one of numbers manipulation through head count reductions, pull back of employee collaboration events, expense restrictions, etc. All necessary business practices, but odd when everyone from first line management all the way to the top lives inside of CRM looking for additional pieces of revenue.  I don't know how folks actually generate new dollars when no one is in front of the customers or our prospects. The good news is that the CRM package is really solid."

3. Competitive salary -- I feel that I was justly compensated.","1. Sweatshop -- I saw this word in the title for another review, and I would agree ... there is always way too much work to do for the time allotted; your manager expects you to do it all.
2. Churn -- projects come and go; so many projects on which we worked hard did not actually ship :-( [eg TKS, ORION, ... (a long list)]  It hurts my mind to think about how much money IBM must have thrown away?

The aquisition process has been very shaky. We were officially acquired a few months ago yet a majority of us still haven't been issued IBM laptops (which we were told we were going to be issued). Our entire pay day schedule changed which was annoying at first. In addition, the fact that it's such a large company, it is much harder to talk to someone within the company."

There are some great co-workers at IBM.  I've found the lower management to be generally very good at recognizing and valuing their top contributors, but middle-to-upper (and to executives) are not to be trusted by the employees.","The pendulum has swung from IBM's early days of placing value on the employee, where the employee could count on IBM's provision and protection, to today's environment of only caring about immediate impact on the stock price (and its associated executive compensation).  Investment in the future, valuing individual creativity and innovation, and fairness to employees have all disappeared.

In services, it is seen as more important to bill extra hours than doing a great job for the client.  Mediocre employees do better in this environment because it takes them longer to get a job done and/or to re-do the work.  The good employees finish early, leaving a happy client, but then are on the ""bench"" and fired.

This wouldn't be an issue in product development area, of course.  Perhaps top skills are valued in those environments."

This can be a pro however, as once you have reached the point where you no longer care if you get made redundant (even with the legal minimum redundancy payment now being standard for IBM) and have realised that it's not always the bottom of the pile that are targeted for redundancy so working hard won't necessarily save you, then you are free to be mediocre at work and have a great stress free home life. Also, eventually all the goings on become so ludicrous that it's actually quite entertaining once you learn to laugh at it all. So if the above sounds good and you can accept the fact your starting salary will be similar to your  end salary when you leave, you could fit in quite well.","It can get a bit depressing reading about Ginni's bonus going up and up and up as IBM's revenue goes down and down and down (just like the lower ranks pay rises, bonuses and perks).

At meetings, those people are the loudest voices and the most frequent interrupters. Sometimes they interrupt others just so they can repeat what their colleagues say, showing that they are actively participating. In fact they are contributing nothing more than annoying all the hard workers and wasting everyone's time.  Instead of putting a check on those people, the management praise them for their contributions and leadership.

The shift into CAMS (cloud, analytic , Mobil , security) is sudden and also late so clients and employees don't know how to go from here to there with IBM."

Limited educational opportunities (impossible to attend external courses, conferences, etc. that cost money).  Focus on ""fighting fires"" (which are often caused by the issues above) instead of sensibly planning and working on long-range goals everyone believes in.

Multiple large layoffs have crippled the company and the loss of that experience is not recoverable. The current philosophy to ""constantly reinvent yourself"" from the CEO breeds a deep and constant sense of confusion and lack of cohesive direction.

Since the days of Gerstner, they have been considered liabilities on the books rather than assets, and it shows. I believe that because they have access to less expensive labor in other countries, they, as a rule, do not care about keeping U.S. employees happy, or keeping them at all for that matter. There is a constant squeeze to spend NO money on education, travel, etc..., salaries are generally stagnant, though IBM is making record profits. There is a general sense, even among some AMAZINGLY capable people, that IBM does not treat them with respect, and does not value them. The result for me was, I stopped caring about my job and my company, though I did like the technical work. The overall experience was dehumanizing.

If you need stability in your employment, this is not the place to go. As a contractor, I was used to short term contracts. But because resource actions happen multiple times during the year, even regular employees have the same stress as a contractor.  Decisions on resource actions are determined by departmental budgets, not on how skilled or unskilled an employee you are. If you are someone who constantly keeps their resume updated and is always looking for a job even while employed, you might be able to handle the uncertainty on the job.

The other divisions of IBM have incentives and motives that are not always aligned with Research's success.  Though some projects are funded by IBM itself, departments have goals for the revenue they need to bring in from outside IBM and the bureaucracy and layering makes it difficult to reach those goals.

I spent the majority of 8 years on an airplane twice a week.  From this, I gained career experience that few others outside of consulting would be able to have.  During my career at IBM I was significantly underpaid compared to consultants working at other consulting companies. 
It took me a while to understand, but IBM is a sales company, not a delivery company.  If you excel in delivery, you will not be rewarded financially or with career advancement.

Appreciation for working hard ($4 raise when my contract was renewed for the Spring semester)","Working from home - when you're a student, learning a new language (node.js), and being new to web development, working from home can be very inefficient and result in hours wasted over many months of self-teaching while also producing.  Other internships will sometimes include a mentorship program, or you're in the office, at the very least, with more knowledgeable coworkers nearby.  Also, if we had to work in the office, some of the other interns would actually do work instead of watch cartoons.

IBM is slow.  We were slow to get started after getting the offer letter (which was also late), and now IBM is slow in the hiring process for the interns they are keeping after graduation.

There is no sense of anyone being valued; people are laid off all the time without adequate warning, support, or compensation; and people just do not like working here any longer, plain and simple.

Many teams, even those in legacy business units such as Systems, have already fully adopted the most advanced industry best practices such as Agile, CI/CD, Design Thinking, etc. to great effect. Since IBM touches almost every technology that currently exists and employs people of almost every skill set, the opportunities are endless. Work-life balance is also extremely good.

- Tools - While IBM has made some notable improvements in their MarTech stack, bringing them from the 1980s to the 21st century, all their ""home grown"" tools are not even close to being industry standard, are cumbersome and extremely frustrating making it hard to do your job and get work done. 

- Accountability - With all the restructures, what marketing is accountable for is on an extremely un even keel compared to other disciplines. There is simply too much to do and not enough people to do it.

In most cases all employees are treated as adults and their is little micromanaging.  You know what you have to get done and as long as you do it nobody cares when.    This is particularly great when working from home or when you are on a non-traveling assignment.

IBM is a leader in managing remote teams and its management is comfortable with remote teams and never 'seeing' employees.","At IBM you either travel or your job will get outsourced.  You are often quickly type cast and if you have one set of skills it is very difficult to get onto projects where you can utilize skills you are trying to develop and need hands on experience.

Personnel managers are often clueless and simply pushing papers as most have too many employees under them to truly be effective in their roles.

Annual reviews often limit managers to only rewarding 1-2 employees outstanding ratings and everyone else is average.  This is due to employee reviews being tied directly to bonuses and the limited bonus pool.

Perks have long ago been eliminated...you have to even pay for coffee through vending machines.  

Employee morale is awful.  Many high-performing employees have left for other opportunities, taking valuable knowledge with them.  Software quality is suffering, and many customers are dissatisfied.

The general mood is that upper-management does not care about their employees at all, and only see us as numbers in an expense column.  Nothing is more important than profit margin targets.

Clients of IBM are astounded with the results, and will recommend consults to other company's.","As in any consulting firm after completion of your project you must find of create other projects to stay off the bench.

Most people have adult lives and have things that come up. Working from home on occason = more productivity/happiness.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Mar 4, 2022","Current employee, more than 5 years",Good pay and benefits. Most employees are willing to lend a helping hand.,"There are some good leaders at IBM. However, those who thrive are those who embrace the cut-throat culture of selfishness, tribalism, and self-promotion above all else and others.

While IBM takes steps to hire diverse talent, internal advancement suffers from a system that is very personality driven and influenced by strong in-group/out-group dynamics. Depending on business unit, leaders may not even hide favoritism and may openly demonstrate a lack of fairness in support and performance measurement. For minority demographics as roles increase in seniority, expect to have one’s contributions routinely minimized or attributed to others, be held at arm’s length while peers are invited in with open arms, and be required to have more demonstrated experience and eminence than peers to advance to the same levels. In some cases, one can expect to be asked to teach recently promoted former peers on aspects of their job at the next level, while being seen as not capable of holding the position outright. Lastly, expect apathy and deflection from executive leadership as IBM does not consider these behaviors part of the inclusivity discussion. Even when some leaders may believe there is an issue, it is political suicide to speak up as one does not cross the tribe."

Pay plans are convoluted to the point where no one really understands exactly how they get paid.  Every year I worked there they changed the pay plan to pay us less and very few folks got raises (and those who did said the raises were a joke).   They have been cutting back recognition programs the last couple of years so high performance isn't really rewarded anymore.

- little to no salary growth at all.  IBM management makes it clear that you should feel lucky to have a job with Big Blue and are shocked when anyone leaves the Blue Bubble. 
- Doing more with less means that you have more than one job and are barely compensated for your first job
- Cost cutting and slashing employee benefits are ALL IBM management cares about these days.  I would not want to be a customer.

If you claim actual time worked, then the account is charged time and a half for everything over 40 hours and you have to take FTE cuts to compensate for it.  My last year at IBM I worked an average of 80 hours a week.  I worked stretches of 30 days straight without a day off and without compensation for it yet was mandated to do it by management in order to achieve goals and targets.

They have nothing better to do than walk around and complain. Unwritten rule that contractors can't be hired on as full time IBM employees. Even if you leave a contractor position then get hired on two years later they will hassle you about how they don't do that and insinuate you worked behind their backs to to get that job.

Are they always being ""Pulled"" to perform troubleshooting. What are their schedules, are they also on other projects? What other responsibilities do they have?

This is also a Con, see below.","One of the biggest challenges is the internal competition between sales groups for the client's dollars. Sellers are compensated only on their specific part of the portfolio. Even down to the brand level, sellers are only compensated on various components.

Project assignment staff are not technical, and really don't understand what they're doing. How can you work at a technology company and have absolutely no technical knowledge or background, especially in a role where you are assigning resources to contracts?
Tend to place people in training just for the sake of keeping people busy. If your available you're put in it, no matter if its related to your job or has anything to do with the area of work your in.

My plan is to retire at the end of 2009 with a very rewarding career and a good pension.,All major companies have areas that could be improved. I have found that the budgeting process for each department and division needs some improvement. Also at times the management team has a tendency to assign more people to do the same job.

Very little effort is invested in employee development, strategic asset development and long-term client relationship building.

Hours are long, resources are few, work/life balance is poor, and there's no confidence in job security. Management is inconsistent -- brilliant in spots, embarrassingly clueless in others."
Brand specialist,3.0,"Sep 11, 2015",Former employee,IBM is an IT behemoth that during the on board process makes you feel like you are part of one big happy family who will be there for you at all times.  Before you even get stated on you first job assignment they are already encouraging you to keep considering what your next position at IBM will be and how you will be broadening you experience at IBM.,"IBM is also an IT behemoth that can’t get out of its own way.  Upper management overthink organizational changes on a yearly basis which delay sales processes and disrupt customer satisfaction. Then they wonder why revenue targets are missed when the first 3 -4 months of every year are thrown into chaos due to mixing the soup on an annual basis.  The company talks about its people being their greatest asset yet the management of this era have little consideration for the employees.  It is understood that all organizations need a clearly defined method of evaluating work performance, although IBMs PBCs rating process is flawed.  Marginal / Poor PBC ratings of 3 are routinely assigned to well performing employees just to justify Resource Actions."
It professional,4.0,"Jul 3, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","The company has a wide range of both formal and informal initiatives surrounding volunteer work and giving back to the community. There are also ways to start a new activity for helping a specific area not already covered by one of the many activities. The management and company as a whole are extremely supportive of these activities. Participation is encouraged, though not required and often there is direct funding to accommodate certain aspects of volunteer efforts. Allowances are made in employee schedules to accommodate the timing of your volunteer efforts.","Continuous cycle of periodically trimming portions of the work force, particularly in the US is a general concern. This is related another general concern, which is the continuous budget cuts that come in the Information Technology area. This creates issues with growth of services, solutions and skills and contributes to pockets of poor morale."

If you are older worker you’ll be pushed out the door soon enough.  But younger workers as your replacement ? They only last a couple years because it’s a terrible place to work 

As a Sales Rep you can be only as good as your products and they have let their products go to crap and aren’t even recognized as remote contenders in most areas because they are so outdated and bad.

Alliance manager,4.0,"Nov 20, 2008",Former employee,"Many of the people. Basically good people. Lots of resources in terms of jobs, benefits, opportunities, etc. Working at a large company like IBM for twenty four years was like working for several companies. The jobs ranged in responsibilities and most of the time as a professional hire you were pretty much on your own in terms of managing your time. Assignments were given and it was up to you to decide how to approach and or deliver results.The people at IBM for the most part are great people and one can develop great friendships. IBM's reputation carries a lot of weight in the industry, depending on the type of job you're seeking.","Too large and complex with hundreds of procedures, many layers of management and politics. The culture and size of the organization can also make one feel isolated. Often times because you are on your own in terms of how you work, you may not actually see your manager for months at a time. The business controls and procedures can sometimes bog you down with the time it takes to develop the necessary documentation to meet compliance. It can also be frustrating when you discover there is duplication and some managers operate with blinders on and just direct you to comply if if there is duplication."
Project manager,4.0,"Jul 17, 2009",Former employee,"Given the size of IBM, there are a variety of business areas to work in and gain tremendous business knowledge.  In years past, strong and competent employees had many opportunities to move around to different job roles across various business areas.  Most managers empower employees to be self-sufficient and independent ... ""micro managers"" are in the minority. It was easy to feel a sense of personal ownership in the work that you were doing.  There was generally a very good teaming attitude across departments and business units.  IBM employees are typically very bright, ethical, and well trained professionals.","It seems that executive management does not recognize the value of people performing operational/support roles.  If an employee is not directly impacting revenue, that job is likely considered non-critical and subject to elimination.   I understand that revenue is critical for business success, but this approach is somewhat tactical and rather short sided in my opinion.  In many cases, employees are simply considered expendable resources.  The respect that IBM employees used to garner from management seems to be non existent."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Jan 31, 2012",Current employee,Benefits including health care insurance are available from the first day of work. Premiums for a family with kids (IBM PPO plan) are $319 per month plus $33 for the Basic PPO dental plan. The company matches 5% towards your 401(k).,"There are a lot of IBMers who work from home. That's fine, but it is thing of the past. If you get into one of their Delivery centers, do not expect to be allowed to work from home. Due to a new ""process"" and ""framework"", all work now should be done inside those center (sort of ""team work"" or ""team work environment""). So to summarize the Columbia (Missouri) delivery center:
- no work from home
- very limited-choice cafeteria with a coffee machine working only from 11AM to 2PM. They sell a cup of coffee for $1.39. So people bring thermoses.
- no free coffee (no coffee makers are allowed - so you cannot create a coffee club)
- no free hot water (to make a cup of hot chocolate or oatmeal). To fair, there are microwaves.
- no windows (there are windows but they are frosted, so you can't see outside)"
Senior hardware and software support,2.0,"Sep 8, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","Fairly decent salaries and benefits, but on a downward spiral.

Get hired, get some training and experience, build your resume and 401k, then move on. 4 to 5 years tops.","Management concentrates on keeping stock prices and dividends stable, instead of employee well being. There is no long term vision for IBM, no 10 years, 20 years, 50 years. Management can barely see beyond the next quarter. The company chisels away at salaries and benefits each year. They demote entire classes of employees, take away shift premiums and overtime, reduce headcount, yet expect continued high levels of productivity. Morale is in the toilet, yet management fails to acknowledge the problem. Employee buying power is eroded due to IBM's no raise policy and inflation. Even 1 performers may go without an increase for years and years."
Senior software engineer,2.0,"Nov 28, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years",The 401k program has very low expenses,"Senior executives are clueless idiots.  They are so far removed from the technology and are totally preoccupied with hitting a specific EPS, that the bottom is falling out of this company.  

The hardware business is on the verge of total failure.  The software business is based on buying smaller software companies, pushing the new product to existing IBM customers,  then off-shoring development & support for the product.  This is ""pump and dump"", but for software.  IBM has done so poorly in Cloud services, that they had to abandon their current offering and spend a rumored $2 billion to buy another cloud provider.  That provider (rightfully so) refuses to integrate solutions like IBM Power because they know what an unmanageable and uncompetitive disaster it is.

The working environment is incredibly toxic.  The threat of layoffs is constant.  The vast majority of tech people in this company are embarrassed to work here.  The ones with skills are leaving in large numbers, even if it means losing stock grants, 401k matches, and retirement benefits."

My team is located all around North America, which can also be cool. It's like working for a well-funded startup. I believe in the company's leadership.","IBM's facing some tough times, and will likely continue to lose revenue for some time as it shifts to new business models. The newer, faster-moving business unites (Cloud, mobile, etc.) can sometimes contain multiple teams with overlapping responsibilities, which can be confusing and frustrating.

At a time when most IT companies recognize the value of American workers, IBM is stuck in the '90's, still trying to outsource everything to india, reduce all investment in their accounts, and increase fast cash for the share holders. 

If you are into legal or sales, I am sure IBM is a great fit since their main product is iron clad contracts so their clients can't escape once sales gets them on the hook.

IBM does not really contribute to the American economy. IBM business model is dismantling American/European IT and replacing it with a cheaper Indian help desk version. The clients suffer the most. And no, you are not allowed to try to help the client. Not until management convinces them to pay extra."

They are cutting a vast majority of the US workforce below management level and replacing them with offshore people. My ex-customers are (still) leaving as fast as they can. 
The people still left are doing the work of those culled and getting toxic reviews (3's) to ensure they're next on the list. More and more hours, minimal, if any, bonuses for the troops and no pay raises that aren't wiped out by decreasing benefits and increasing costs. 
This place is not where you want to work if you don't have a management slot waiting for you. Management is bloated, the RoadKill 2015 facade gutted the company and further huge cuts to the US workforce.
Beware anyplace where the stock price and earnings are king. You are no more than a body to them. The cultural values that once existed and you'll hear parroted are long gone.  Long hours without pay, the demand for more billable hours over 40 and the diminishing return on your efforts will make you appreciate almost any other employer."

One's starting salary is very competitive; however, after that, significant salary increases are few far in between.  Performance bonuses are not substantial and only given to ""top performers"".

They do a poor job of selling and writing contracts and the workers bees have to deal with the repercussions of undersold contracts and not enough projects in the pipeline for when we hit the bench. Compensation is terrible, you will not make the market value for your skillset unless you come in at that rate and the possibility of ever achieving that rate is slim to none otherwise."

IBM has a message that their technology is disruptive to various industries, but inside the company they  still do things ""the IBM way""--which is to say they use outdated processes, tools, tracking systems.  Most times you spend your day filling out spreadsheets instead of using any of the internal systems.

Lack of managerial awareness of employee contributions results in significant lack of developmental opportunities and promotions.  The availability of multiple back-end systems and resources available to manage processes and track performance is a two-edged sword.

Also, almost everything marketed to me when starting this job has been highly exaggerated. I was told to relocate in the middle of a pandemic and then sent to work from home for the next year. We're allowed to work in the office now but its not as nice as it was advertised. You have to provide your own second monitor, even in the office.

Too much politics within orgs and only different forms of flattery will give you a promotion rather than hard work.

Code Quality is very bad as most of the people try to go around the problem rather than actually fixing the problem. Most of the managers do not have a minimum technical understanding, less testing done when code is pushed to production and thus too many bugs and customer complaints.

Thousands of employees with more than 25 years of service have been released since then and no longer get 6 months.

Staff software engineer,3.0,"Jun 13, 2008",Current employee,"The opportunities for education and personal growth within IBM are amongst the best in the business.  Even when education budgets are slashed, the resources that IBM provides to its employees are amongst the broadest and most comprehensive.  IBM is also very respectful of the balance of Work/Life, and takes great pride in providing flexible scheduling and location based working opportunities.","The best and brightest at IBM are often restrained from doing their best work because of the numerous interruptions and distractions that are constantly present.  When a resource at IBM is discovered to be competent, their performance is hampered by their less competent peers.  It's the law of averages working against a company that has the potential to be more innovative and more creative than most of the competition, but the large population that IBM takes pride in maintaining weighs it down."
Business analyst,1.0,"Feb 10, 2009",Current employee,The benefits and perceived respect for IBM in the marketplace.,"Unless you reside in the ivory tower in Armonk, you are just a serial # to this company.  Management is a joke. They are not respected, because generally speaking, most of them are incompetent.  They rely on their team to make them look good, so when it comes time for recognition, they have no problem accepting it for themselves, rather than passing it on to those who ""truly"" deserve it.  The PBC rating system (yearly review) is a joke, it is a luck of the draw exercise.  I have found that in 10 years with the company, it seems we spend more time trying to justify our employment by making sure our powerpoint presentations look pretty and also that the data presented to executives is as ""accurate as possible"".  Employee morale is horrible.  It has become a depressing company to work for."

3. at companies the size of IBM you work within Policy and Procedures, Approval Limits, etc.   If you are entrepreneurial, you will chase down the approval routes and document each one on the road to getting things done.

New hires are trained by the person who had the role previously, if the previous worker is already gone, you are in trouble.

Discrimination against Asians is nonexistent, or at least not significant enough for me to detect.

There is a wealth of opportunities to progress at any time.

Very proud to be a part of this team.

Aside from the culture, the pay is competitive and benefits are good. Remote work is completely acceptable and there is no pressure from leadership to come “back” to the office.

There is almost too much technology -- through acquisitions, legacy and research, not to speak of assets developed by IBM services, it has created an unwieldy and vast number of products, technologies and components that make it difficult to move quickly.

Unless your good at sucking up, you won't find much progression here.

Collaboration across divisions is forced at best. Consulting personnel are not up to standards of Big 4. Lack of depth in key skill set areas cause true SME experts to be spread too thin.

Windows systems engineer,1.0,"Mar 26, 2015","Current employee, more than 1 year",The overtime was nice when it was available.,"There are yearly ratings for each person in each team. Each team has a bell curve. You can be a hair lower in experience or progress compared to your peers and end up being graded poorly. Which results in no bonus. This is a very unfair system.

Depending on what account you work on, you could be applied to no overtime, oncall rotation, and in the cross fire between teams. Again, there is more arguing of who does what and whose problem it is than actually going ahead and doing the work. Just about every little adjustment requires a change that can take anywhere between 24 hours to a week to be approved before you can do said change.

Moving up in the company can also be very difficult. At the time I came in and later laid off, openings on my account were non-existent. Those with experience mostly held their jobs.

Training was non-existent and you learned as you went.

Last, the company seems to be laying off people at random. Regardless of how much you worked or not. You can have a really good or average PBC and still be laid off."

They were hiring engineers like crazy in my area but laying off non-engineers, bringing back some positions as contract only. I wasn't eligible for raises or bonuses in my classification, but if I had secured a regular FT position, I am sure the compensation would have favored the SW engineers.

Constant re-orgs; I was only there 30 months and was part of three re-orgs and had 3 managers.

Mad men mentality and acceptance of sexual misconduct by the senior staff. It seemed all the VPs and almost VPs had girlfriends they traveled with (IBM employees) while still obviously married. These were very visible IBMers, think headliners at conferences. I found this very nasty and backwards, and I think it had a negative impact on young engineers wondering how they advance as they saw these girlfriends get prime assignments and travel to all the best conferences."

Now... it's unclear what markets and products matter to IBM. This year has been topsy turvy in the hardware business and the management style has become harsh. With continuous layoffs and cutbacks morale is quite low. Pay for sales is erratic. There isn't much positive to say about the current environment. Maybe it will change? Clients are confused by the ongoing disruption in relationships with IBM sales and support. The company has experienced 18 consecutive quarters of reduced revenue and profit. How long can this continue?

The current HR plan is to cut cost driving experienced sales and technical staff out through layoffs. There are no clear internal opportunities for promotion or growth as only external hires will be considered for job postings.

Sales plans are changed every half. What you sell changes, who you sell to changes.
They have a calculation that they use to determine if you are succeeding in sales or not. What it doesn't take into account is that there is a 12-18 month sales cycle. When your territory and clients change every 6 months... and it takes two months to get the details to you... you are expected to achieve in 4 mo what it takes 18 to do. The only way you luck out is if previous sales reps have gotten something to the finish line and you capitalize on it. Their calculation for what it looks like to ""succeed and have the necessary skills"" changes as well. So you never know in six months if you'll have a job or not."

IBM also has a history of broad layoffs. After a long history of full employment, the first few rounds of layoffs at IBM were mostly merit based, but over time merit appeared to have less and less to do with layoffs, as entire organizations were eliminated without regard for individual merit.

Cost cutting is being taken to an extreme, from everything as simple as office supplies to something more complex like commissions.  Every team meeting was about finding new opportunities and closing business.  ""Everybody sells"" is the corporate mantra.  There's a stated goal to get EPS to $20 by 2015, doing so is going to hurt IBM (there are plenty of articles about this, just Google for it).

4) No resources. I have been a tech-lead for 2 years and only have 1 other member in my team who is both developer and tester. It is an important product for WHI that is highly undervalued and not getting the right resources. This results in challenges delivering high-quality and robust versions.

It provides you with a wide breadth and depth of knowledge over sales, technology, and people skills.
Summits are well respected and looked at as if we hold the future, which we may. We are looked upon with admiration from our leaders, which is an amazing feeling. There is also a very close relationship with your peers. As you train with the same group for 6 months, you become very close.

It is a ""student body right"" mentality that, while understandable from an external facing sales perspective, causes possibly unintended consequences.  Individual measurement systems are not capable for being flexible for the many individual brands that exist within the vast entity and thus HQ level policies fail.  For example, the CEO, who was personally responsible for making and integrating the biggest acquisition of the last 20 years, has almost completely destroyed the brand of the company that was acquired and certainly has run off most of the talent by subsuming it rather than letting it flourish....e.g., GM can't buy Ferrari and then make those same cars for $40K and yet require them to perform like a Ferrari."

You may start with a competitive salary but it is hard to increase it.  IBM then lays off senior workers or forces them into retirement.  The top performers have very little work/life balance.  Work/life balance is a joke.  Relative contribution is used as a semantic tool to give average ratings which in turn save the company money.

But now it seems management has figured out continual employee development has value and is starting to bring back some of that former excellence. 

While you are expected to put in extra time for crunch issues, IBM is good about giving time off for personal things. For example, a very close friend of mine (not family) passed away last year.

- Excellent work/life balance (very flexible work environment; probably, this is the biggest + )
- Massive technical resources for employees to grow their skills (eg. online technical library (Books 24x7), workshops, classes, etc)
- Tons of different projects and it is usually fairly easy to switch between projects, so you won't get bored","- Low base pay
- Promotions are extremely slow or non-existence 
- Performance reviews are ridiculous and your work will be compared with the rest of the people in your level (no matter how hard you work on a project, you could still get a low rank and no raise)
- Too much bureaucracy 
- If you are thinking about getting your master/PhD, Tuition Reimbursement is like lottery, you sign up and pray to get it
- Absolutely no innovation; if the current solution works, DO NOT TOUCH IT kind of mindset. Hence, the management is very resistance to new ideas."

I had the opportunity for some excellent training, and worked with some really smart people on exciting, state-of-the-art projects.","At least on the services side, IBM reorganized at least once a year, which meant a constantly changing set of objectives and goals and no real strategy -- at least not one that was ever shared.  I had fourteen managers in twelve years and there were times that I worked for someone for several months without ever having a conversation with that person.  The organization is ridiculously top heavy and mid-level managers have to spend an inordinate amount of time reporting to various executives.

I usually flew out to the client site on Sunday and made it back home late Friday evening.  Also, you'll be expected to contribute to other projects and assist in scoping new opportunities.  Most of these activities occur after hours of your primary project.  It's all about billable hours, so if you're not on vacation; you are expected to be on the road at a client site - no exception.

There are endless training opportunities and lots of things to do.","IBM periodically goes through an exercise called a ""Resource Action"" or ""RA,"" which of course is a euphemism for a layoff.

Despite being one of the top-rated employees, I received a total of 2.5% raises over a 3 year period. The DBPP was discontinued so executives could see their stock options soar in value, replaced with a far less generous defined contribution pension plan. If you wanted to take an opening in another location, IBM would not compensate you for the move. I was expected to work weekends at least once a month, without ""comp time"" off.

3.) Loads of red tape internally. Good luck getting your work done.
4.) Expect new territories every half. Management likes to mix it up and the customers do not take you seriously as they know they will have new reps. in 6 months.

This type of communication to a large degree, alleviates the family/ work conflict.  In other words, because I am ""allowed"" to prioritize my family, I don't mind staying late, working early to excel at my work.

And over and over and over again they seem mystified as to why they aren't seeing the target results.  They have vision but lack the ability to think through the details.  Changes are rolled out without a thorough stakeholder analysis, without adequate warning, and without adequate training.

There is also no accountability for decision making.  When changes have been rolled out that didn't work well each manager's response was ""Well, this issue is above my pay grade"".    When issues that could impact our team came up the leaders had to be prompted to push back and make sure the change was really necessary.

Before my team even touched the ground, the sales team had already spent a week doing ""consulting"" then asked us to provide the final deliverable in 3 weeks. In fact, they asked us to provide our recommendations the first week we landed. They did all this to win the deal and try to win larger deals but put my team under the gun.

Employees are treated as interchangeable resources - history and experience don't matter when Finance orders its annual job cuts.  This has demoralized the workforce and inhibited innovative thinking.

It really sucks when you get a lay off notice and they force you to train your replacement in another country. 

Moral is at an all time low for everyone I work with so no one wants to do a good job anyone. 

They keep getting rid of good skilled employees and replacing them off with off-shore resources, without reducing the workload. What they fail to realize is that something that took a couple hours to complete now takes days...due to language barriers and time zone differences. How is that more cost effective? 

It also seems like the company has been in 'transformation' for YEARS. It is very difficult to get and keep ones bearings when it's likely that everything will change again before too long. Why even try to keep up?"

Senior offering program manager,4.0,"Jan 9, 2019","Current employee, more than 10 years","For those afforded the opportunity to work from home, there is great work/life balance.  The company does have some decent benefits, though healthcare benefits have waned dramatically over the past few years.  The biggest benefit of working in a company like IBM, however, is the ability to move into different roles and try new things. The company is vast, and opportunities abound.","I've worked at IBM for many years.  The culture has shifted dramatically, and not all for the good.  The executives clearly don't care much about the individual employee and are focused, quarter to quarter, on the stockholders only.  They have yet to realize that treating the employees well will result in better results, better profitability.  The shift to ""co-location"" within the past couple of years has done a lot of damage to morale, even for those not directly impacted."

Decent benefits","IBM has ZERO loyalty to its employees, particularly in the US.
Work goes offshore -> fire US employee
Cheaper out of college resource available -> fire US employee

Also, as documented in various lawsuits and industry articles, if you are over 40, there is a target in your head. You work hard, and get good reviews throughout your career, so that you reach a decent salary band. Great, right? Wrong. Because now you are too expensive for IBM to make a good profit margin, so you are a top candidate for one of the many Resource Actions. That's when there is an arbitrary order from the top for managers to cut a certain percentage of people above a certain band.

For the record, I'm still employed by IBM, and managed to survive many rounds of cuts. But I have absolutely no illusions that my job is safe.

If you are young and need a relatively low starting salary, IBM is probably hiring across all fronts.  So you can make a quick buck. But if you're interested in starting at a company where you can grow, look elsewhere."

If you are the type to always be interested in the next big thing, IBM strongly values innovation, so keeping up with new technologies and being able to recognize how they may benefit your product is great habit to have.","Being such a large company with so many employees there is a lot of red tape and processes for everything. Office politics play a very big role in how your career grows or doesn't. In most positions you will have an active customer base and may need to work odd or extra hours as customer issues come up, which can be stressful.

Manager,3.0,"Mar 1, 2011",Current employee,"IBM culture and management have traditionally been supportive of employees' advancement and career development, allowing for people to try different disciplines.  There is a system in place to ensure that promotions and financial compensation/incentives are merit based (not based on internal politics).

I think that the financial compensation is competitive with industry standards.  Though benefits seem to have been cut back over the years, I think they are still competitive with the industry.","It seems more and more evident that everything at IBM comes down to ""the bottom line"" (money/revenue).  Earnings per share (and the resulting Executive compensation) seems to have become more important to the corporation than their employees.

The company cuts back costs (staff, equipment, contract services) at the expense of the workers.  Meaning we are expected to ""do more with less.""  This mentality seemed reasonable at first, but it has perpetuated into a vicious cycle where we expect more and more (and more!) out of our people.  Many/Most people are overworked, and work-life balance seems to be a distant memory.

While the culture has traditionally supported employee career development, in harder economic times managers can be reluctant to let their good employees pursue opportunities, for fear of losing the head count - Finance will see it as a chance to save money (and not allow you to backfill the position)... So if somebody leaves your group, more likely than not, one of the existing team members will just have to absorb the additional work... again adding to the overworked staff.

There are MANY corporate practices/processes that have been put in place over many years. Most (not all) of these processes were meant to make sure that the teams delivered a high quality product that met certain industry standards/regulations.  Though we cut back on staff, and we have to do more with less, we never seem to cut back on process.  This is a double-edges sword... Cutting back on some of these practices/process may cause us to deliver a poorer quality product, or to not meet certain standards/regulations... But not cutting back on process means that more and more of our time is spent navigating process.  Spending time on this, and trying to get your ""real work"" done adds to the problem of an overworked staff.

While there is a system in place to compensate based on merit, over the years the differentiation between the best employees and the average employees has become laughable (corporate funding for these programs seem lower than expected, especially considering reported company earnings).  The minuscule difference between compensation for the best and the average employees have made many people question the point of working so hard (If you can put in less effort and get compensated the same, why kill yourself working 60 hour weeks???).

Finance seems to be making many decisions which they are not qualified to make.  All they care about revenue versus expense.  They have been given power to dictate our expenses, though they do not understand the impact of cutting certain expenses.  Penny pinching today may cause you revenue for the next few years if we don't have enough resources to put out  a product."

I was rated a 2+ and the following year my client had a large cut in their budget. Consequently, the client cut every contract in place and rescinded existing opportunities. Although my client directed as much work as possible to us, my sales were significantly down from the prior year when I was rated a 2+. Although I had been part of the organization from pre-PWC days and I was known for excellent to outstanding work, I was summarily fired although IBM tried to sugar coat it by saying there were too many employees at my level. This classification was a joke as they promoted others to band 10 during the same review. One of the employees promoted to band 10 had been fired by a client for doing a poor job yet the employee was promoted."

There is a plethora of talented people in the workplace.

Because of this, most of the employees who would otherwise be motivated and passionate to innovate, just put in their time, and hope they survive the next round. Perks are practically nonexistent. Benefits, if you can even call it that, continue to get worse.

Salary is subpar compared to the competition. And salary increases are a meager 1-3%, if you are even lucky to get one. Promotions are quite difficult to come by, and management does little to nothing to help you grow in your career.

The buildings are old and dilapidated, and many of the offices are vacant. This sets off a depressing mood as you stroll down the hallways. But what I find most amusing are the water fountains that are not chilled. What's up with that?"

Prior to that we were only required to be in the physical office 2-3 days a week.","Management seemed to always be nervous about any changes from the top and it trickles down to the staff. When I was there, IBM seemed to cut staff every other quarter, especially if they have acquired the IT department of another company or state government. The point is, IBM does not care nor do they value the people  quality people that work there.

A LOT of escalations to ""pull a resource from your #1 project to support my #1 project."" No work/life balance and loads of weekend/overnight work. 

Pay is substantially LOWER than market average - even after obtaining certifications. I was promoted in title several times without compensation.

Lastly, if job security is important to you this is not the place. Most of the jobs have been shipped off-shore (without consent of the customer I might add). Global Delivery Centers established just a few years ago within the U.S. are ghost towns as the jobs promised to the community are now - overseas."

In February of my last year as a technical person I made a 90k bonus responsible for large sales. One month later told my position no longer needed. The funny thing is they would keep continue to hire people for the same role that was going away.

Everything about IBM is now a who you know up top to shield you. You lose your safety shield and you’re exposed. It’s dumb when you see worldwide experts let go, but those who are just buddy buddy with upper management are kept around when others do their role for them."

They have no experience or skill in managing employees. 

Time on the ""Bench"": You have little to no control over your career in the first 2-3 years at IBM your manager will have full control over any horizontal/vertical movements you desire to make as there is no internal job application platform. Some employees will be put on the bench after being hired, meaning you will have no job to do, in my case I was told to watch Netflix on my first day. 

Poor work culture: Older employees are constantly afraid of getting laid off, entry level employees will work very hard and not see any recognition, some employees will sleep at their desk and nothing will be done."

The inter workings of the software are as complex as they come and to boot there is a real lack of documentation and training. Its all cult knowledge that will take years and years to obtain. 

There is easy early advancement but its just too keep you interested.

Aggressive (sometimes unreasonable) schedules/deadlines for projects. Constant reorganizing of teams and resource actions (lay-offs) leaves many teams understaffed and lacking skills for achieving success. Employees are no longer treated with respect from upper management. Team reorganization and technical decisions are make without consulting the people below actually doing the work in many cases.

Frequent customer turnover for account teams which was not well received by strategic customers.
Was mandated to perform the job duties of two roles AE/TSE after being a TSE for two years which was not sustainable or fair.

In some parts of the company, IBM may be an industry leader (this assertion is not true for the consulting business).","IBM is a massive company. You will not be singled out for much praise for great work. If you consistently get above average ratings, you won't get big raises (expect about 1.5%, so less than normal inflation, even raises for promotions are small), you won't have any opportunity to improve your skill set (since you will be in the same role for a few years...it's IBM's way of doing things), and you won't have the opportunity to move within the company (not unique to IBM).

Growth opportunities are available if you are willing to work for it.,"Work life balance at IBM: Work until you have no life. Many IBMers are required to work 44 hours per week in order to increase employee utilization, which is basically a fancy way of stealing vacation and holiday time from employees by requiring them to make up their off time throughout the entire year.

Annual reviews (called PBC's) are a joke. The only way to obtain the best rating is if you sacrifice a large portion of your free time (above the 44 hours/week) in order to pursue education and ""giveback"" opportunities. This is unobtainable if you desire to be a family oriented individual and are committed to volunteer activities that do not benefit IBM.

Telecommuting (as an engineer) is very common, especially given the automation and IT infrastructure of the fab.  It's not unusual to work from home if you need to.","The microelectronics division seems to be often overlooked by the larger company, though it clearly is a key part of the overall picture, especially for the server brand.

When your ""Total Compensation Package"" nears $130-$150k USD management appears to view those with advanced skills in software & Engineering as a place to cost cut (AKA layoff).  IBM lobbies Congress for more H1-B workers because they ""cannot find skilled workers"" that they know already had worked for them, yet fail to rehire after layoffs.
Also reportedly the Pro's mentioned above don't exist anymore.  Business nearly always found an excuse to not pay bonuses & raises on par with other tech companies."

There is no leadership in middle management.  Just a brand who tries to dictate and convince its clients that the IBM way is the best and only way.  Proprietary hardware has been a downfall since the early 90s.  There are a few good products such as Watson, but innovation elsewhere is lacking.  There is a lot of bureaucratic mess to being an employee, and salaried folks are expected to put in 44 hour weeks in most instances.  Business development does not last long because of inflated prices, or poor contract performance.  Employees are expected to recruit college students for helpdesks and menial duties.  To them it sounds great, but to someone with 30 years in the industry it is easy to see and impossible to correct the problems within the business. Yes it is a matrix organization, but though there are many meetings everyone is totally disconnected.

The most important consideration for any new project is ""How can we staff it with ""resources"" from China, India, Brazil, etc. Whether they have existing staff that can do it or not is irrelevant. Having the project succeed is secondary at best.

If a job doesn't require shaking the customer's hand, or US citizenship, expect them to move it offshore as soon as they can.

Company is wildly disorganized at high levels. Their historical 3 businesses are hardware software and services. Hardware and software are basically doomed by cloud computing, and they aren't prominent in cloud computing services.

Internal politics dominate basically everything else. Each round of cuts tends to increase the percentage of ""political operatives"" in the company - since people who are political manipulators rarely get laid off."

Computer operator,1.0,"Jun 16, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years",It's a paycheck.  Nice to have the name on your resume. It explains you need to find a new place to work.,Not allowed to vary from the tasks for your job or risk breaking rules of lean management.  No meaningful career advancement options without working day shift and replacing your next immediate superior when and if they leave.  No realistic career track or mentoring available.  Productivity improvements are gained by heaping more and more work on fewer and fewer full time equivalent employees regardless of what the service level contracts promise customers.  Management meets its performance review targets by double booking man hours on multiple contracts resulting in inadequate staffing levels.  Rank order employees in performance reviews punish mistakes and job requirements leave no room for exceptional performance.  If you stick with this company and you’ll destroy your long term career path options.   Then you'll get an offer to retire early so they can hire a college grad for less than half of you salary.

Vacation time is low at the beginning. look past that, IBM is very flexible with time off."
Software development manager,4.0,"Jul 31, 2022","Current employee, more than 10 years","The benefits and salary are good. Work life balance is also good. Work is interesting and it's possible to have a life and a family along with a good high tech job.

Company culture / values / are good. It is an honest, decent company.","Aside from salary, not much opportunity for participating the company's success. Very few employees get stock options, and bonuses are miniscule, when they come at all.

Most new hiring is being done overseas, as IBM is run by accountants, who think that a developer in one locale is the same as any other, so why not hire the cheapest engineer in the world. This leads to globally distributed teams which don't work very well (get up early to meet with team members in Europe, then stay up late to meet with other team members in India and China -why not?)

The company;s practice of rotating executives every 2 years leads to a lot of dysfunctional teams. Short term decisions are made, because executives know that they won't be around a few years later when the cost of bad decisions comes due."
Senior software engineer,2.0,"Jun 29, 2008",Former employee,IBM has some very bright people and some good technology. They allow flexible work hours and location. Benefits and compensation are industry average. Work/life balance is generally pretty good.,"IBM is old and it shows. It doesn't really feel like a technology company. Processes are cumbersome. You can just imagine some ancient mainframe software running the place. 

I worked in the software business group. The overall feeling was that software engineers were interchangeable. There must be something wrong with you if you wanted to be an individual contributor and liked to write code. Promotions and awards were much more about politics than technical merit.

There are too many rules and managers are afraid to push back. Employees are constantly told what they cannot do along and threatened with potential penalties. A couple of examples: print jobs needed to be picked up within 30 minutes or you're cited by security. Office doors need to be locked and blinds drawn when away from your desk for more than 15 minutes. Silly stuff."
Software engineer,2.0,"Jul 30, 2009",Former employee,"I was a developer at IBM in Tivoli for a little over two years and started fresh out of school.  Generally, starting salaries (fresh out of college) are fairly competitive. Mostly all of my co-workers were very professional and cordial. Given the size of the company you have an opportunity to move around if you really network well; however, this is getting harder and harder to pull off. Also if you want to work from home there are plenty of opportunities in development, test, project management, IT, etc. that will allow you to do it either full or part-time. Also flex-time was truly flexible; many a time I ran long mid-day errands without anyone raising an eyebrow (rating system is ""results"" oriented, I'll get to this later). There are some really interesting projects mainly in the Software Group Strategy, Rational, and Lotus pillars if you are good enough to maneuver yourself onto one of those teams.

Health Benefits were quite basic for a big company.  You get a standard 80/20 with about a $700 deductible for free and you payed about $75 a month for each additional dependant.  They had other options that weren't bad but they got expensive quick; however, after the sixth child it's free!  You also can get a lot of discounts such as 25% off cell phone service and employee pricing on GM cars. Vacation was 3 weeks plus 4 - 5 floating holidays per year which effectively meant you got 4 weeks of vacation not including U.S. national holidays out of the gate which is pretty good.  Also the 401(k) match was not to shabby at 6% dollar for dollar.","Some people joke about executives only caring about the stock price and running their company only worrying about the quarter to quarter results, IBM does it.  This quarter to quarter madness is quite understandable when you realize that a good chunk of the VP's incentives are in stock options.  Why should they care about anything else, but the stock price?  This is where they get brilliant ideas such as taking out loans to buy back company stock instead of using it to build products or buy more companies to gain market share.

And this brings me to my next point.  IBM is not doing very much home growing of products anymore. They tend to buy a company, add some features to the product, slowly let attrition and layoffs take its toll on the U.S. workforce while pushing the product to maintenance mode over in India, China, Argentina, or one of the other BRIC type countries. One of the products I worked on lost about half of its U.S. workforce in two years. Every time someone would leave the company or move to another product team they would not backfill them. If the natural attrition didn't work they would do a layoff and hire replacements in one of the forementioned countries.  The problem with this strategy is the replacements were typically very green and knew their jobs were safe no matter what, making motivation an issue. This combined with constant benefit cuts like Tivoli free sodas/coffee being taken away (oh sorry, the email said they were aligning the drink policy with IBM guidelines) leaves the morale of the U.S. employees effectively in the toilet.  One more note on the drink thing, the email they sent saying they were cutting the free drinks was dressed with the typical corporate language so they had to send up a follow-up email to clarify it. This leads me to my next point.

If you want to be treated like a five year old, work here. There is nothing like working hard through a product release while the executives push/prod, make you work the weekends to keep on schedule and at the end they send one of those ""YOU GUYS ROCK"" emails which is supposed to motivate us even more. I remember sitting on meetings with fellow employees struggling for recognition with from the executives, it reminded me of dogs fighting for scraps from the table. The scraps being that when review time came around only one or two people would get the highest rating while the other 90% got the solid performer/average rating.  And even if you did get a high rating expect maybe a 5% raise and a 7% bonus woohooo! don't spend it all one place.  For the rest, better luck next year.  Another problem with the rating system was how managers were the only ones with any input and they normally new the least about who was the best and did the most work. Their ignorance not being of their own fault so much as the fault of the countless meetings they were constantly stuck in all day.

Oh yeah, IBMers love meetings, almost always to the detriment of productivity.  The meetings were where all the power grabbing was so usually the loudest voices were listened too and respected. Meaning that if you wanted that high rating you would need to make sure your opinion heard, whether or not it was valid, so as to make sure you could check off that teaming section in your end of the year review.

Now  to get back to my title, this place is not the worst place on earth to work, but it far from the best.  Don't let the fancy ""I'm an IBMer"" commercials fool you into thinking it is as hip and progressive as Google or Apple.  If you are a go-getter self-starter type you would probably do better working at a start-up or a small company where you can really have an impact.  I remember reading in college about all these famous inventions by IBM and its alumni and startups such as Craigslist started by former IBMers, and for some reason I missed the former part. Yeah, IBM gets a lot of great people, but many of the truly successful ones in the industry are the ones that leave.  If not you could end up like some of my former co-workers in their late 20's early 30's who talk about big dreams outside of the company but get comfortable and never go anywhere. Getting comfortable at IBM is easy to do, but that is the biggest mistake you can make there. With the constant layoffs, make sure to keep an exit plan open so when you leave it is for the betterment of your career, like my case, rather than your group missed its quarterly number by a quarter percent and you get hit by the next ""resource action"" or ""restructuring"" (a.k.a. layoff).

So bottom line: feel free to by stock in IBM, just don't work there."

Even though IBM can do so many things ranging from software to hardware and finally services, getting the groups to work together is extremely difficult.  It is even hard within Services to get different Service Lines to work together.  Partners tend to worry too much about how their group is looking and not look out for the overall good of the company.  Additionally, when in global services, you never feel safe.  You feel that you could be layed off (resource actioned) out at any point in time.  Throughout this year, I have known a considerable number of top performers RA'ed due to billable numbers, and not need."
It architect,2.0,"Mar 16, 2010",Former employee,"IBM Global Services is a great way to get frequent flyer miles.  For the young and single and travel lovers, this is a fantastic organization.  I would recommend this organization to any recent college graduate with few commitments.  It was a great way to learn.","The organization is so huge it is very easy to get lost in the shuffle.  The reporting hierarchy was strange, at best.  I had 4 different managers in my first 3 years with Global Services.  I never felt like any manager at IBM had my best interest in mind.  Someone once told me that the most talented IBM employees leave after 7 years or less."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Aug 6, 2013","Former employee, more than 3 years","The environment is almost totally virtual; working from home was GREAT. IBM has resources, brand recognition and money to get information, analysis and respect that you will not find with many other organizations.  Response levels are HIGH; for good or bad employees are usually ""online"" or reachable in one way or another. There are some very high callibre people you will only work with in a company like IBM.","This is an enormous company with far too many useless layers of management.  Half my job was spent creating ""fire-drill"" reports for managers to present to their managers.

Possibilities for domestic and foreign travel are always available.  Exposure to great cutting edge technologies.","C-Level executives and Board seem bent on reducing or near elimination of USA work force.  No longer a company that innovates and invents.  Now just a company with deep pockets that buys new technologies, takes what it wants then discards the remainder.  Time will tell if Ginny can hold IBM together or will be the one to sink the ship."
Technical team lead,2.0,"Jul 29, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years",IBM offers a great deal of education in a shorter period of time than many companies. They are a process driven firm which helps individuals become familiar with their job role more quickly. They have moved to a pool environment in many areas which provides structure to each of the technical teams.,The pool environment tends to limit exposure to other areas of technical interests. This also reduces the ability to focus on any given account or segment of the business causing customer dissatisfaction. The processes documented do not address much more than the most common courses of action which places some additional limitations on staff functionality.
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Apr 3, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years","Wonderful colleagues, good health and dental.  Fairly professional in general.   Up until recently, working from home.","Very toxic from an employment perspective.  For the last 15 years it has been a case of Russian roulette with annual resource actions.  The last 5 have been particularly bad as the fat has been removed and the staffing is far below minimum.  Off shoring has been a continuous churn with unqualified folks replacing knowledgeable resources and leaving IBM shortly after turnover.  Unrealistic project deliveries, due to under staffing and unrealistic scope.  Expectation to work above and beyond is a daily norm and the knowledge that if you don't you will likely be fired.  Resource actions now quarterly and move back to one of 6 centers are driving moral to new lows.  ""new collar"" and H1-b visas continue to drive employees away."
Human resources,5.0,"Apr 25, 2017","Current employee, more than 5 years","Continually re-invents itself to stay relevant to changing times.  IBM is 'World Issue' relevant, not just a technology services company - focusing on solving issues such as curing diseases, ensuring that expertise in areas such as healthcare, law, finance is available to ALL, no matter where you live or your socio-economic limitations, etc. IBM has had a focus on equal pay and diversity since long before it became a focus for other organizations. Career development opportunities are second to none, the internal movement of staff to new roles is a constant focus","Sometimes it can be a little bureaucratic and overly 'matrixed' - but with 400,000+ staff its difficult not to have some of that..........pay/benefits are good but not industry leading - real motivation to join comes from the career opportunity presented, the chance for personal and professional growth once in IBM and the thrill of working for an industry leading brand which is taking Watson to the world."
User experience designer,4.0,"Sep 6, 2017","Current employee, more than 1 year",Bootcamp is a 3 month program (too long in my opinion) which is designed to give early career professionals a thorough onboarding experience/training. I feel like I can pull out a design thinking tool to solve any problem now.,Bootcamp was way too long and they didn't give the option of doing industry if you had less than 3 years prior work experience. It will also make it extremely hard to move up as they lump you in with college hires and pay you the same.

Experience working directly with engineers and a variety of different job roles as a designer. Good practice advocating for users to people who aren't used to thinking about them.,"Where to begin. For one thing, IBM is letting middle management is drive it into the ground. Every step forward taken by very talented engineers and designers is eventually ruined by a complete lack of vision, strategy, and alignment by an unbelievably bloated middle management layer. Marketing teams are allowed to set product strategy based on questionable ""market research"" and also promises product capabilities to the public that are completely unrealistic (e.g. Watson for Oncology). It borders on unethical at times. There is no money for raises and promotions - unclearness and even dishonesty about this is rampant. There is zero transparency, and absolutely no engagement from HR to support individual employees. Every few months hundreds of employees are ""RA'd"" (""Resource Action,"" which = layoff)."
Advisory project manager,4.0,"Sep 20, 2008",Current employee,Wide range of experience in different industries.  Opportunity to work with some very talented and diverse people.  My experience has been that there is some slow time at the end of projects that you can take advantage of after a grueling project (but not always).,"There are some incompetents at IBM, who are very hard to get rid of, and very frustrating to work with.  It's hit or miss when management addresses performance issues with these types of employees.  Formal training is lacking in my job category.  You are expected to find time to complete the computer-based training while you are more than 100% utilized on your project(s).  Promotion criteria is nebulous, and not communicated well.  There are so many ""corporate procedures"" to follow that you get lost with what's truly important while you are trying to do your day-to-day work."

Low morale due to small raises, little growth, and perpetual layoffs and outsourcing
Little cooperation between sales and direct marketing 
Middle management is given little empowerment due to tight-fisted budgets

Business development manager,4.0,"Apr 2, 2009",Former employee,"IBM has lots of good technology and good opportunities across a lot of different divisions, ie Hardware, Software, Services.  The people are typically great, very smart and professional.  If you work hard and have results, you are typically rewarded.  There are lots of different opportunities for sales, technical, and management oriented people.","IBM is a VERY large company with the accompanying bureurocracy.  The current environment in the US is a bit disconcerting - with everyone constantly looking over their shoulder for the next layoff.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that will ever change as IBM seems to now use resource actions as they way they change business, rather than actually changing the business.  Therefore, there is no real loyalty to the company any longer."
Manufacturing operator,3.0,"Oct 3, 2013","Current employee, more than 5 years",12 hour work shift means you only have to work 3 or 4 days a week. At least 2 weeks of paid vacation with the opportunity to earn more.,"You have to work most major holidays including the 4th of July and Thanksgiving. They never have funds available for morale building events like they had in the past.

If you have issues with payroll you must call employee services where you are directed to a call center overseas. These employees have no real idea what's going, only a rouch black and white outline of what is suppose to happen. There is a HUGE disconnect between even the manager and payroll. 

When you leave IBM it is very common for them to over pay you and then either take the money back (straight from your bank account) or send you a bill, threatning to send it to collections if you do not pay.  They hire, fire and layoff thousands of people every year... you would think they would get this right by now."

Management doesn't get innovation and how to create an environment where individuals take ownership.
Stovepipes prevent communication and collaboration.  Comp plans actually incentivize groups NOT to cooperate.  
Rounds of layoffs have lead to demotivation, and lack of CEO communications leads to more FUD."
Software sales,2.0,"Mar 25, 2014",Current employee,Pockets of highly intelligent people who have spent years mastering their field are an excellent resource.  Many IBMers willing to be mentors and help you.  Team work is strong and technical resources are great. Some of the kindest people I have ever worked with. Work from home.  Flexibility is probably unparallelled.,"Acquisition mash-up. Execs are put in charge who know little about the technology or the new buyer. Knowledge base is dwindling with turnover which is a constant, and customers are not pleased.  With the knowledge base goes the innovation.  Morale is in the can and no strategy to retain top talent.  Good reps are looking elsewhere.  No salary increase, even if you are a top performer. Opportunity to advance is slow and painful.  Sales tools are process-heavy, out of date, and not integrated. Spend more time reporting than selling. You are a serial number that delivers a quota.  Pay is not industry standard."

Most of the real IBMers are simply  fantastic people to work with.","Wow, where to begin. L1-L2 management are largely nothing more than puppets. I actually had a manager say they made a decision based on a coin flip. That sounds funny at first, but it really isn't.
Work-life balance? What's that? I've missed numerous big family events for essentially nothing in return.
Personal work reviews are a joke. HR gives first line a manager a bucket of numbers to assign their employees regardless what the team is really worth. Very few get what they actually earn. Roadkill 2015 is a huge moral killer because of all the layoffs (actually mass unjustified firings is what they really are). Execs have finally gotten as corrupt as other big companies. Very sad what this great company is becoming. Watson is rolling over in his grave."

They hire anyone who has touched a computer. I have been with IBM for 2 years. never saw a promotion, can't apply for other jobs in IBM because I'm a critical player in my team, but people who have to come to me for help on a constant basis are favored for promotions. for a company that thrives off of innovation, whenever I innovated something, it took a long time, and a lot of reaching out to dead ends to bring my ideas and innovations to life. it is defiantly a company that looks better from the outside, than it does from the inside."

The breadth of teams an opportunities means you can move around in your job without changing companies.,"Senior leadership is completely disconnected from the people on the ground doing actual work. Also, every org cares only about their own revenue, which leads to massive inefficiencies as seven different teams in five different orgs with 6 different executives are all trying to do the same thing, and none of them are talking to each other or coordinating. 
From a development perspective, its all still run by engineering with no balance between them, product management and design. 
Also, 20 quarters of declining revenue and an abundant avoidance of risk means that everyone is anxious and pushing stress around without being able to actually do something to fix it."

1) Rocket Center is the epitome of “Glass Ceiling”.  If you’re in the CIC, you’re a second class citizen. Period. They will try to tell you otherwise, but it’s painfully clear they don’t expect much from CIC and refuse to care about CIC employees.

 Many benefits (401k, time off, education  reimbursement , basically all benefits) are watered down. We get less matching that people who non-development jobs, and we are expect to work 44 hours without overtime pay.

Meanwhile the people who work “Staffing” jobs, the people with zero technical background, get paid overtime and receive a higher 401k matching. 

This is completely backwards.



The turnover rate at Rocket Center is insanely high. Seriously never seen anything like this. It’s a complete shitshow and I’m embarrassed to be a part of this."

Everybody's experience is completely different because of the lack of structure. I have seen some great, smart, capable people get treated poorly and end up leaving because of timing and luck.  A lot of the people at the top could sometimes care less about the people below and are clearly very much in it for themselves.

There are very few opportunities to climb the ladder towards management and even though they encourage you to be open about your professional goals, they will not let you pursue them unless it benefits your manager personally. There is an extreme lack of women and the pay and opportunities are not equal (though they claim it is).

It's easy to find side projects to grow your skills & portfolio, and you'll need to do that.","There is no real upward movement. Unfortunately due to the sheer amount of staff, management doesn't have proper headcount or allowance to allow for promotions. This means that more senior designers eventually leave for other organizations, or are removed with yearly layoffs.

Frequent periods of less-intense work (not on purpose—usually because of administrative overhead/blockers, but it gives employees time to take a breather).","Big ""meeting culture"" despite the potential for most meetings to be more effectively handled via slack or email. Experience highly dependent on how your immediate manager or squad lead treats you—though frequent structural changes mean you probably won't be on the same team for more than 2 years.

IBM doesn't stick you in a little box - if you've got interest in different areas, they'll work with you to make it happen. It's easy to get exposure to cutting-edge work, even if you don't yet have the background for it. Fairly chill about different working styles and accommodations - if you need to leave for a bit to pick up your kids or run an errand, that's fine, as long as you're still responsive and ultimately getting your work done. Respectful of time off.","Salaries are somewhat under-market. IBM also relies on a lot of custom internal tooling and somewhat dated infrastructure. They're in the process of updating their infrastructure, but the custom tooling is both a benefit and a drawback - in chip development it's a source of competitive advantage, but it also provides less transferable skillsets if you later leave the company. The larger tools are generally well-documented, but for the smaller ones your mileage may vary.

The emphasis on marketing over actually delivering a quality product/service/customer experience. 

Seems like the only way to be promoted is to become a better ""IBMer"" not deliver value to customers, improve customer experience, or improve an offering.

Frankly, management orthodoxy at IBM is equal parts drinking the kool aide, and gas-lighting subordinates. Basically, you have to be able to lie to yourself and others as easily as you breathe to get promoted

The diversity of IBM's people and products allow this too happen.,At this point in my career I can't think of too many downsides.  We have a strong portfolio of software products and alot of demand in the marketplace.  Sure quota's are crazy but I'm sure they would be that way at any other place.  Folks who don't make it at Big Blue should reflect on themselves on what they could have done better.  My approach is to always understand the clients issues and identify IBM solutions that can address those issues.  There has to be a fit otherwise we come across as Snake Oil Salesman.  Not good if you want to have a good relationship with your clients.
Senior manager,4.0,"Feb 27, 2009",Current employee,"IBM has nearly a century old legacy of being  in the forefornt of Human Resource Policies, it was one of the few major corporations to have a manager of color, to having given benefits to same sex couples to prohibit discrimination. It is one of the few companies which cannot officially donate corporate contibutions ( via PAC) to politicians. 
 IBM has always tried to hire the brightest of the people from various schools or other companies, this in turn has helped the company maintain a very high caliber work force. 
IBM does have some good benefits, one of the very few companies even today offering free medical to employees.","Like some of the legacy companies IBM seems to have too many managers, the hierarchy level is simply too large for it to function in todays day and age esp when it comes to customers requiring immediate feedback.

Pay is good if you can get hired in at the right rate.","Management is grinding their employees out, expect to be hired on for a position only to pick up one or two extra jobs within a year of working there.  
Miserable work environment, morale is very low and gets worse with the constant fear that layoffs are coming.

IBM is now a dying company, with incompetent upper management and a work atmosphere with the pallor  of a funeral home.   20 year plus IBM employee and I have watched a once decent company disintegrate.    IBM culture is dominated by the internal politics of fiefdoms and is not longer a customer centric organization.l  Employees are not viewed as assets of the company but rather as costs to be minimized.    The best way to view IBM is a place to work for 1-3 years, to pick up a specific marketable skill and then leave and use it in the open marketplace for top dollar. IBM does not pay well and its benefits are not that good and educational opportunities are dismal.   You will be vastly overworked, underpaid and work in a depressing environment by a company that seeks only to exploit it line"

The company embraces a virtual team environment, so you can work in one city but work with individuals in different cities.  This can create a more challenging work environment since you cannot simply walk over to a co-worker's desk to discuss a work item.  Management can also be located in another city.  Bottom line - there can be a dearth of face time which can hurt you during your annual review.  Also, there is a tremendous focus on getting more bang for the buck.

Virtually all of the experienced employees have been laid off, all positions have been outsourced to the cheapest, least experienced parts of the globe.

Entire internal company systems (knowledge based, IT, etc.) no longer function as those who created them have been let go. 

The company's execs have only one goal--short term profit and expense cuts that will line their pockets. There is no concern with the consequences that these executive decisions will have next year, much less in five years.

This has all created a company death spiral (lower revenue in Q1, more job & budget cuts in Q2, and so on).

They recently implemented the co-location policy within the marketing department, which is expected to expand to all other business units as well. This doesn't just mean that we could find an office closest to us, we were given the ultimatum to either re-locate (in my case halfway across the country, first to San Francisco and then a month later to Boston), or find another job. I think this decision was a little short sighted, and a thinly veiled attempt to reduce workforce costs by forcing those with families and loved ones close by to either resign or essentially start their lives over.

It is also a global company that allows you to work with people from around the world and learn how to work together despite our differences.,The challenge of having an amazing history is that you have to push hard to not rely on it.

There was also no structure for advancement or learning if you were new. No mentors, or training path. There was no way to get yourself off the bench to pick up more hours doing other Workday projects or post production support.

The ability to work across business lines is an art and a skill understood by only a few. Significant politicking is required to keep your job from being outsourced. Layoffs are an annual event.

All of that burden falls on the employees in the form of fewer resources (mostly staffing, but also increased times to replace obsolete hardware), benefit cuts (mostly in reductions in pensions and increases in health care costs), and depressing facilities (lousy cafeterias, unpainted buildings, unrepaired sidewalks, etc).

The pressure is unrelenting, no one in marketing does any actual marketing they simply take numbers and information, drop them into powerpoint decks or incredibly myopic 'funnel charts' and 'spin the numbers'. Good, decent, seasoned professionals that have spend years trying to right the ship are being let go and replaced by inexperienced college grads and yet management wants to know why the numbers are off, why the pipeline isn't healthier.

The pay was adequate, but perhaps felt a bit on the low end vs. competitors.  Benefits felt a little stingy.

Anecdote: For his annual performance appraisal, one Distinguished Engineer told me his process looks like this.

- Relatively easy to change teams and move to areas of emerging technologies","- As it's the case for most big companies, if your group or team projects are less exciting and less revenue generating outside of R&D, you won't have a pleasant ride."
Software engineer,3.0,"Jun 8, 2022","Former employee, more than 3 years",Flexible projects with potential to learn a lot. Can meet a lot of people and grow a solid network of respectable peers. Great place to learn architecture as you’ll be building a lot of projects from scratch/early stages.,"Unorganized and understaffed for many projects. Unrealistic deadlines and expectations. Promotion track revolves around workplace politics, selling, and yes manning management instead of merit or performance based. Often seen as just a body to throw at a project, despite qualifications. This creates unorganized and inexperienced teams trying to meet unrealistic deadlines quite often."
Senior project manager,4.0,"Aug 11, 2008",Current employee,There are lots of opportunities for advacement and to do different and challenging things. The benefits package is pretty good. The vacation package is reasonable and IBM is very good about extra time off for getting married and having children. There is also a lot of opportunity to work from home.,"IBM is very beauruacratic,, and it is getting worse. It becomes more difficult every day to get things done.  The education opportunities used to be much better. They are very restrictive now about the cost of attending classes. When I began 8 years ago there was much focus on promoting educaction and having people develop new skills."
Program director,2.0,"Aug 22, 2008",Current employee,"IBM has a very respectful working environment.  Employees have tremendous freedom to complete their work.  There is a campaign environment to much of the work that divides the year into distinct cycles and phases.  The opportunities to interact with Research, Services, Software, Hardware, and Industries provides a lot of areas for professional development.",Very slow career progression.  Many executives bully employees.  IBM constantly revisits old ideas instead of searching for new ones.  Some of the best leaders have recently retired.  The yearly PBC review process is arbitrary and the goals are often abstract.  IBM has one of the most convoluted compensation programs in the world.  Complaints from sales reps about unpaid commissions and constantly changing bonus metrics are so common.
Customer fulfillment representative,2.0,"Sep 30, 2008",Current employee,"IBM still does have a decent benefits package - Insurance, sick leave.  Even though the cost is much higher that we have paid in the past, it is still much lower and coverage is better than what you can get on the outside.","Hours - management thinks that we should be living, dying breathing IBM.    We are penalized for things that are out of our control.  Lack of respect from management.  Many feel that we do not have the intelligence to do our jobs."
Senior engineer,2.0,"Dec 30, 2008",Current employee,"There are some top notch technical people at IBM and in general, my coworkers are competent and pleasant to work with.","IBM Microelectronics' glory days are in the past.  It lost its technological leadership years ago and it has long been a second class semiconductor manufacturer.  As IBM continues to be less and less a hardware company and more and more a services/software company, its days as a semiconductor manufacturer seem numbered.

Working for IBM in general is a cold, dehumanizing experience.  As an employee, you are a piece of office equipment to be surplussed when business needs change or when there is a business downturn."
Sales representative,2.0,"Mar 4, 2009",Former employee,IBM has a reasonable wage.  And it still has a family like culture.  IBM values Diversity so thoes who are diverse will be more Secure.,IBM is a good place to work as long as your manager believes you are in the in-crowd.  Once Management changes and you are no longer in the in-crowd and things get bad in the economy then they will get rid of you.  I was just laid off after many years of great performace.  I was left scratching my head as to why they chose me.  There were plenty of others that did not have the skill or pashion for the job as I did.
Senior managing consultant - user experience,4.0,"May 27, 2010",Current employee,"IBM has always been very respectful of work-life balance and time off for life events, etc. Leaders are generally very accessible and willing to engage all employee levels. The work can be very rewarding.","The spreadsheet mentality means that they may not always completely understand how to value a good employee whose benefit to the company rises above their bottom line or utilization tallies (particularly in the area of User Experience and other creative/design roles). It was NOT always like this here. It seems back in the earlier part of the decade, we were encouraged to ""Do the Right Thing"" and were rewarded for our efforts and risk in a more organic way."

After all, this how they grow their personal wealth...through stock options.  Living in constant fear of being sold off or outsourced.  No conferences allowed.

Product manager,4.0,"Jul 17, 2014","Current employee, more than 10 years","On the whole, IBMers are a smart and motivated group. The company is well managed with an excellent management track, once you get on it.  With its breadth of hardware (decreasing) and software (increasing) products, it can provide 'one stop' shopping for its clients.  The company has an excellent worldwide reputation which is good enough to get you in the door of many potential clients.","However, there is a lot of corporate structure, some of which is needed to mitigate risk, but some that seems to have gotten a life of its own and lost track of its original intent.

Anonymous employee,1.0,"Sep 18, 2014","Current employee, more than 5 years","Flexible hours, working from home.","Management is top-heavy.  Jobs of hard-working U.S. employees are constantly being outsourced, off-shored, downsized.  Cost-cutting is the only goal.  Ageism is rampant.  No job security.  Project Management is a joke:  efficiency and hard work is ignored, old knowledge/experience has been retired, cut up and replaced by multiple foreign workers who don't know or understand how anything works together. Pay has decreased every year, no bonuses, OT no longer paid. No pension, 401(k) company match only at end of calendar year if one is ""lucky"" enough to still be employed.  Employee morale could not be lower.  Non-management employees considering unionizing.

Anonymous employee,3.0,"Feb 18, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years","IBM feels like a lot of small companies, that is good when you want to move around, as you can  have a lot of experiences in different positions, domains, locations and working with a lot of individuals.","1) The best talent tends to leave IBM in order to be more appreciated  (read ""paid better""). Those remaining, especially second-line management exemplifies the Peter Principle  (promoted beyond their level of competence).  2) The technical support infrastructure, software tools (laptops,Lotus Notes, ST), etc.are old and/or buggy technologies. Internal human support takes too long to address, that you spend hours searching the intranet for self-help, taking away from job productivity time and time again."

Great healthcare benefits for full time employees.  As an employee you get a lot of discounts from various companies.,"Because of the size of the company it's extremely hard to get recognized for good work.  Pay raises ate based on a ranking system that is unfair.  I say this because senior management tells your direct manager how many people they can select for each ranking. 1 is the best 4 is the worst, only 10% of staff can be a 1, 10% can be a 2, the 80% left need to be 2's and 3's.  Only people with 1's get a raise."
Analyst,2.0,"Sep 20, 2015","Current employee, more than 5 years","You may have some decent people to work with, and you probably won't have to talk with the ones you don't want to.

Anonymous employee,3.0,"Dec 11, 2015","Current employee, more than 10 years","Good exposure to new technologies (usually through acquisitions) and good support teams behind you.  Mostly work from home office which helps, but travel can be high as sales teams and customers are scattered over your territory.  If you are just starting out, probably a good place to get some experience and add to your resume, but move on after 5 years or so.","Commissions and quotas....IBM constantly makes changes to control your earnings, so very difficult to have a blowout quarterly paycheck.

Some of the few left are the ability to telecommute when needed in most cases. It depends on your manager.,"This list gets larger every year but the biggest con is that there are constant layoffs. IBM values its stock price over its customers and employees now. Layoffs have nothing to do with your performance and everything to do with your being a senior employee making a higher salary. Last I heard for people getting laid off this year you only get 1 month salary no matter how long you have been with the company. 
Benefits are dwindling slowly but surely."

Repeated layoffs in the U.S. - IBM execs think of employees only as a cost that they want to eliminate.  Everyone is always waiting for the call regardless of performance ratings.

Total lack of respect for employees"

Delivery project executive (dpe),5.0,"Dec 17, 2020","Current employee, more than 10 years","IBM' learning platform is best in class. You will find everything you need, no matter what you are looking for from strategy to execution to technologies. The content is tailored to suit to you role and experience. It's like driving on a predefined pathway without worrying about if to go left or right. Leadership provides enough opportunities to take a break from day to day hustles and learn. In fact there is mandatory training each need to finish every year which kinda forces you to thin hard where you will spend those required hours so that helps you to succeed.","Like any other big organization, IBM is huge and you need coach or mentor to navigate you. Finding right coach or mentor is something that most of the folks find tough but recently IBM started addressing this through more collaborative platform for mentors and mentees - time will tell how that helps address this only con of such a great organization."

I occasionally feel that IBM is behind with the times in some aspects and long term vision is unclear to me. Tech seems archaic.

I have worked 70-hour weeks for years, and still can't accomplish everything I want to do to feel satisfied with my job.

I always tell people working at IBM is 90% filling out forms / 10% doing actual technical work.  IBM needs to start caring about employees again and we will care about the company.  Until then, we will be unproductive."

Something always seems to be changing which requires learning a new system or process that is not always an improvement.  The ability to work from anywhere is also one of the downfalls.  I have found that employees (regardless of their position or standing) are expected to be available at all times regardless of what is going on in their life."
Staff software engineer,2.0,"May 3, 2009",Current employee,"IBM provides flexibilities such as telecommuting, flexible hours, as well as a casual working environment.  Employees have unlimited sick days up to a year.  It also provides educational opportunities such as internal classes.","There is a lot of bureaucracy.  Many managers believe that people who talk the most during meetings are people who know.  Many managers are not technical people themselves.  That creates unnecessary layers of inefficiency.  Employees also have to use up their annual vacation.  If you don't use it, you lose it.  Salaries are relatively lower compared to other peer companies.

People just expect to answer your phone whenever they call - you just have to ignore them or say no. There is no point in letting it suck your soul if they aren't going to reward you for performance."
Hardware engineer,2.0,"Aug 23, 2008",Former employee,"Employee competance, in my experience, is outstanding.  Engineers and most management personnel are very intelligent.","Workload is extremelly overwhelming most of the time.  It is uncomfortable to address this issue because all employees, including management, are in the same boat.  Many times management is not on-site, which makes confronting workplace issues difficult."
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"Jan 11, 2010",Current employee,IBM has excellent executive management and they know very well how to run business. I would say IBM is a good investment but not a good employer. You can learn well about business if you are in management chain at some senior level.,"IBM is not very well paying employer. IBM has excellent executive mgmt but they are quite conservative in passing profits down the line. IBM is always striving to increase margins and they try that from both the ends. Increase product/service rates and pay less to employees. IMO, this is short term view instead of developing satisfied work force with high moral."
It architect,2.0,"Feb 8, 2010",Former employee,"Good place to learn technical basics.
Good access to technical tools.
Unfortunately there just aren't very good reasons to work for IGS.","To many management layers.
Promotion and raises heavily dependent on how good you are playing office politics.
To many under performers that drag down the good workers.
To many first line and second line managers that simply go through the motions.
Very little personal responsibility and accountability. Promotions go to those who avoid responsibility. Common game, is for ""senior"" technologists to avoid direct work assignments but ""assist"" lower band workers. Often the senior technologist provides no value, but implicitly is given credit if the project succeeds, and completely avoids accountability if the project fails."
Software engineer,4.0,"Mar 14, 2012",Current employee,"IBM has an exceptional level of professionalism at all levels. The management is top notch, and there are essentially unlimited resources if you know how to access them. It is reasonably easy to move around within the company. That in addition to a 1 job year commitment policy provide opportunities to try new careers without leaving.","The processes put in place to make such a large company viable, also serve as frustrating obsticles to create change. IBM has become a very top heavy company. Due to new policies put in place to address this, it is slow and difficult for new graduates to move up. This is especially frustrating when collegues at other companies get promoted multiple times while you wait."
Availability manager,3.0,"Jun 30, 2013","Current employee, more than 1 year",Excellent benfits for employees paired with a generally relaxed environment and very good work/life balance.,"All levels of management like to spout corporate BS about people being assets and looking forward while entire focus is on how much money they can post to Wall St this quarter. This causes many internal tools to fail to work properly as resources are pulled of projects to work on others or just laid off resulting in less efficient working conditions. They are now asking how to keep contractors furloughed to below 40/hrs per week without paying any extra. Raises are still on hold for at least this year, maybe next for contratcors and employees."

It's Beige Man, in not only the physical surroundings, but in the energy, the vibe, the leadership/management of people.  Creative, Innovative, and status-quo challengers will find it stifling and consistent with the same ole' lumbering bureaucracy where people are just numbers to be manipulated."

It is trying to act/react like a cutting edge, small company and it's just not feasible.  There are too many high level management personnel who just want to keep doing the same thing over and over.  The review process is all politics.  If you're not constantly ""contributing by delivering services for use by the client"" then you are at risk of being laid off.  This makes it a bit difficult to tell where you stand as you could be working on a huge project that gets scrapped.  Then you have nothing to show for it and that creates an issue when the time for more layoffs come."

3) Business strategy is on track and diversity of thought ensures we continue to succeed..","1) Really cheap.

Anonymous employee,3.0,"Apr 16, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years","The people at IBM were the best.  I learned so much from them.  I started right out of college at 22 years old.   Four years later, we all went mobile.  That was great for me because by then I had a young family. I worked hard and IBM was easy to work for.  I could work anytime, anywhere.","The last 10 years of my career there was a steady decline of morale and an increase in the number of mycoworkers that were being laid off.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 16, 2018","Former employee, more than 8 years",Good for an early career person to get experience if they are willing to work long hours.,"No loyalty or personal development for employees. So many experienced (aka older) employees were let go in the last few years, the people left (mostly early career) do not understand what is needed to plan and execute on marketing programs.  There is no work from home, work/life balance (expected to answer your phone at ALL hours), retirement (minimal and only if you are employed on the last day of the year) or mentors (they were laid off) anymore.  Open space seating makes it difficult to concentrate or talk on the phone.  Bring your own phone for company calls,  IBM doesn't supply you (or reimburse you) with an office phone. No privacy.  Morale is very low."

It is supposed to be if you get 100% of your quotas then you’ll get the $35k. However, there are reps not getting any of that $35k and reps getting way more. Also it can be very defeating making cold calls/emails with no response, hence not making numbers, and not getting any commission contrary to working hard."
Project manager,3.0,"Sep 7, 2008",Current employee,Work / Life balance.  Work from home.  Auto contribution to 401k,"Too big, a lot of slackers.  Very difficult to ""work your way up"" as all future raises will be based upon your incoming salary with a 5% promotional cap.   5% of nothing is nothing, even though the nothing is backed by an MBA (3.9 GPA).  Will be moving on......"
Software engineer,4.0,"Jan 30, 2009",Current employee,Work hours are flexible as long as you can get your work done. The managment understands life and work balance. There are oppurtunities for advancement and that needs you to intiate the process with upper managment. You're encourged to take on site course whenever it's available.  If you're lucky you might get your own office but sometimes you might need to share an office with another collegue.   There are no cubicle at the SVL location.,IBM might not work for young professional because there is not a real energetic culture there and no free food there. I thought there would be finanial aid with tuiation help for training course at an educational instituation but I thought the process was diffifcult becuase it needed to a few level up management for approval. Sometimes you're expected to work long hours to get your work done.
Sales specialist,3.0,"Feb 6, 2009",Current employee,"Movement throughout the company.  Decent pay and benefits.  Fellow employees are friendly and usually pretty sharp.  You do feel like a team, especially since the salaries are rather clustered together.","Management is pretty incompetent.  Products have taken a turn for the worse lately.  Too much pressure on selling and not enough on relationships with customers.  Shady practices with lay offs and outsourcing.  The morale has been pretty low due to the removal of pension benefits and health benefits even though the company was flush with money.  5,000 people were laid off last month even with record profits.  Way too many VPs and directors.  They take care of each other and rarely consider the first line managers or employees."

Some first line managers are good and will save your hide.
Compensation is decent.","The company is focused completely on the bottom line.  Experience isn't valued.  Layoffs have no rhyme or reason, and often seem to be veiled attempts to offshore job functions, and are alarmingly frequent, even if a good year has happened.  The bottom line has priority over product quality and customer satisfaction unless you're a premium customer or employee satisfaction.

If you have a decent first and second-line management, life can be tolerable.

Benefits and compensation are often spun as ""in line with industry averages"", implying that we're only average."

A$$ kissers advance easily. Real talent often overlooked. 1st and 2nd line management usually not qualified. Stodgy, ""Think"" moving an elephant.
Take the job knowing you will leave in a few years. It's a good training ground but be ready to move on to move up. Sales rules. You'll do good there as long as you make the club but watch out for bum territory assignments if you are too successful. That's how they dump you.

- Lots of layoffs which caused a very negative attitude around the office.
- The work was boring. Being right out of college it's fun to work with new technologies, at IBM you're forced to use old technologies like Java and Dojo for web.

My advise, if you are an average joe, fresher. Join to learn some minor experience and leave after 1 year.
If instead you are a senior, ask for high expectations as they will never change that later, if they refuse it is because they were already lying at you and are trying to scam seniors for low budget for low position works."

(continue to Cons)","Our current CEO currently has a very close relationship with the current US Trump administration--an administration does not value diversity or trust.  Makes me doubt how genuine IBM's commitment to diversity is.
Separately, there is currently little job security at IBM currently and the severance/layoff package is only 1 month's pay no matter how long an employee has worked at IBM.  So when working at IBM, even if you are a  long-term full-time employee it is better to think of yourself as a contractor."

Staff software engineer,4.0,"Jun 12, 2008",Current employee,IBM issues laptops to all of their employees and depending on your manager this makes working remotely fairly easy to do. When it comes to HR related tasks IBM seems to trust their employees and their managers as vacation/sick time is not centrally tracked.,IBM is an extremely large company and as such sometimes suffers from its size. Because of its large size the company has implemented many process/requirements that cause inefficiencies in day to day work.  Compensation and pay are awarded based on a pool system that is sub-divided as you move down the organization which results in limited flexibility for managers to reward top performing employees. Additionally as the company is spread across the globe you may be working with people who you've never met face to face for years.

Also, IBM is extremely conscious regarding work life balance, alot of employees work at home on Fridays and the company go out of its way to make sure work/life issues are taken care of. In a time when other companies are failing, IBM's solid business strategy has been able to deliver good numbers. Not many companies can say that.","The company is very bureaucratic in some ways.

Unpaid overtime is expected, 10% to 20% at a minimum.  That's an extra 1/2 day or more per week lost family time.  The Peter Principle is prevalent.  Bad managers are kept in place even with literally dozens of complaints against them.  Reviews are heavily subjective, and good luck appealing an inaccurate one.

I don't doubt that things had to change, but IBM has changed so much that now it is just a run of the mill employer  - actually worse than that, since they so aggressively try to cut back on the workforce and everything they provide the workforce.

Market segment manager,3.0,"Nov 8, 2014","Former employee, more than 8 years",The company has a storied history. It also has a set of values it tries to adhere to. It's not always successful at that but it is better than many other companies in the industry and the values don't change based on the whims of management.,IBM saddled itself with a pledge of a $20 per share of earnings target target that it cannot reach in face of changes in the market. That target caused them to make cuts and jettison businesses that had a strong future because they we weighing on the earnings target. IBM  became increasingly desparate as the deadline for the earnings target came closer and it was not a fun place to be.

The company finds every possible way to snatch away the tiny perks of traveling despite the sacrifice consultants do.
While consultants and those working on ground, who bring real money to the company keep getting ignored, senior management, which is mostly overhead keeps getting paid millions in bonuses and incentives.

There are a large number of interesting projects going on at any given time, and it's nice to be able to say you work at IBM.","Management is completely unaware of what is required to produce quality products, at least in my division of IBM. There is a general lack of respect and concern for the products, and it is obvious that many of the managers are only concerned with their careers without any regard to anything or anyone else."
Advisory software engineer,4.0,"Aug 1, 2008",Current employee,An extraordinary level of flexibility in where/how you work in software development. Many IBMers work at home. This is great for allowing time to deal with the demands of life.,The pressure to perform and deliver is intense and consistent while the reward is 'having a job'. The flexibility (ability to work at home at any hour) also has the ability to morph into a strong negative depending on your managements expectations and people skills. You will be expected to work from home during the evenings/late night. You will be expected to work weekends when management deems it necessary. Management will send you email on the weekend and expect a response. Management will call you on the weekend to instruct you to work on a hot problem/defect.
Research graduate co-op,4.0,"Nov 24, 2008",Former employee,"IBM had a very relaxed environment.  Although I was a co-oping for them while finishing my masters degree, the atmosphere was very laid back.","If you work for IBM for a long time and try to move to another industry, you're in for a little culture shock, most places aren't that laid back compared to IBM.  I know several people who left IBM to work for one of the big finance companies and they went back to IBM to beg for their job back because they couldn't handle the workload and amount of off-hour commitments.  Try to keep yourself up to date on technologies and hardware that's going on outside of IBM to avoid becoming a dinosaur."

Everybody was stressed out about coming to work and wondering when, not if, the next layoff would occur and who was next on the chopping block. There is and was little to no upper progression for most. The supposed mentoring program was a joke. IBM Burlington is just about the only game in town with decent wages and they know it. Little to no acknowledgement of a job well done. Lack of communication. The type of business is very cyclical with many ups and downs.

Good pay.","Moved to Global Services after 20 years in Development.  What a difference!!  Global Services is a soulless organization.  The first three things in their mind are 1. utilization, 2. utilization, 3. utilization.  And the fourth thing is reporting utilization on time (or even better, report it early). Only place I've ever worked where their attitude is that if you have been around long enough to earn more vacation (or happen to get sick), you need to work more overtime in order to hit your utilization target (based on total hrs, not available hrs).  I understand that Global Services is a labor-based organization and utilization is a key metric.  But it's an obsession with management.  First time I have ever felt completely devalued as a person."

Advancement diminished, layoffs every year, only to hire new, inexperienced employees or worse move jobs to other countries and layoff US employees after 20-30 years of experience.  Excessive work hours mandatory, averaging 60 or more hours per week with no compensation for salaried employees.  Mandatory travel, even when you live with in 10 minutes of a site location!!

Any programming you may do outside of IBM still belongs to IBM legally because of the agreement you sign when hired..

As an individual IBM, I've found volunteer opportunities in my community and logged time I committed to nonprofit organizations I've served.

2) Given accounts that have had little to any software sales in the past 5 years!  Quota of $1750K and the history of the sales in these accounts for the past 5 years was under a million dollars!
3) Mgmt will never, ever support you.  Dog eat dog.  
4) the processes they have in place are so mind numbing, frustrating.  Laptop problems arise on a weekly basis.  Have to send it in to someplace across the country to have it fixed!  Frustrating and not productive
5) First line managers are basically baby sitters.  Have zero power and are hired to be micro managers. They are on top of you every second.
6) No work/life balance.  They expect you to work 12+ hours a day.  They monitor you on SameTime.

THE WORST ENVIRONMENT TO WORK IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
