Anonymous employee,5.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Empathetic leadership and an inspiring, organization-wide commitment to improvement.","When role boundaries are unclear, you may be required to handle work outside your expertise—an especially daunting prospect when critical issues demand immediate attention."
Advisory engineer,4.0,"Aug 26, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 
1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 

4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come..."
Ibm cloud sales,4.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","I have truly enjoyed my time working at IBM, especially the training opportunities and benefits provided. It’s a company that invests in its employees and offers great development programs.","Recently, I’ve observed some changes in how roles and compensation are handled. Some senior leaders have been reassigned to lower roles, and there have been salary adjustments, including reductions for those with extensive experience. 

For someone motivated by promotion and salary growth, IBM might not currently be the best place, as the company seems to be focusing on hiring younger talent at lower salaries, while experienced employees are experiencing cuts. Nonetheless, IBM remains a respected company with many strengths, but it's important to be aware of these recent changes."
Customer success manager - architect,3.0,"Jun 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years","Exceptional pay and benefits. Great people, great customers.","- Heavy organizational ""tech debt"" drives down efficiency and job satisfaction. 
- Customer Success is not truly customer success - it's an organization created as a reaction to an inability to deploy products from Enterprise License Agreements. The primary mission of CS at IBM is to identify use cases, sponsors, budget, and gain commitment to deploy software from ELAs. Those are PRE-sale activities, not POST-sale CS activities. Just because an ELA was sold does not mean things are actually post-sale. An ELA is just a contract vehicle to buy something in the future, a gift card sold at a discount, all the normal sales activities still need to happen. 
- Sr. team members are being let go in favor of inexpensive, inexperienced new hires."
Application developer 2,4.0,"Jun 11, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Out the gate, IBM educational material teaches you all about how to be an impactful player as part of an active tech business. You will have reviews of updated material on how to conduct business with others professionally. On a monthly basis you'll have access to C-suite thought leadership statements and chats, and I have even participated in chats where the CEO of the company will voice his opinion on the goings on in tech news as it relates to IBM.

The location selected is a location in WV nearby to where I am employed, as my actual location was not selectable among provided Glassdoor options.","IBM is a big business, and sometimes promotion can seem years away from actualizing due to the changing structure of the company in the big tech boom times we are in. As a young player myself, the desire to self-educate and become more productive with practice and experimentation can sometimes compete with the need to deliver products on a team. I think the company makes it hard sometimes to balance the two, and when you have to do both, you have to work a heavy load of hours to accomplish it all."
Progammer,3.0,"Jun 25, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","You will get experience working in multiple fields 

You will build up tech experience as well as soft skills. This is a good place to start if you do not have better offers, right off the college (especially if you are local or you don't have much experience in IT and you want to have a recognizable name on your resume 

Opportunities for training like Udemy business accounts as well as certifications. IBM proper also have a load of training. 

Decent work-life balance if you have a project. 

Hybrid model is good at CIC. Three days are required at office as long as you have a project.","Very hard to get promoted 

The consulting sector is very chaotic at IBM. 

Expectations are not always clear. 

Project Leadership is lacking too often on multiple projects. 

Pays lower than most other IT companies.

Whatever you do, if you work at a CIC at IBM, you have to get off the bench as fast as possible, however you will have to fight for work compared to another company where they will give you work."

Consultant,2.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Decent work life balance
Remote work for consulting (at the moment)","Revenue is being driven by outsourcing labor to india so that leadership can keep their hefty paychecks while the lower class get laid off. IBM consulting consistently posts <2% rev growth per year. This is not a place you want to invest in unless it is your only option.

Early career consultants - stay away."

• Strong learning opportunities through programs like Developer Jumpstart and hands-on complex projects
• Autonomy and trust - no micromanagement, allowing developers to work independently
• Comprehensive development process from research to deployment with proper testing protocols
• Opportunity to work on challenging, mission-critical systems that build strong technical foundations
• Recognition for good work through equity awards and peer appreciation","• Steep learning curve due to heavy reliance on proprietary technologies that aren't transferable
• Poor documentation organization makes problem-solving time-consuming and frustrating
• Limited ability to use modern tools and frameworks due to legacy system constraints
• Difficult to find solutions online since most tech stack is IBM-specific rather than industry-standard
• Fast-paced environment can be overwhelming initially, especially for new developers"

However, my personal experience has exposed significant internal challenges that contradict its outward reputation as a forward-thinking and ethical company. While IBM offers many opportunities, its corporate culture and policies may not align with the ideals it publicly espouses.

Global Expertise: IBM has a wealth of talented professionals and innovative technologies. Working here provides exposure to cutting-edge solutions and opportunities for global collaboration.
Diverse Projects: The scope of projects, especially in fields like AI, cloud computing, and enterprise solutions, is vast and can be intellectually stimulating.
Professional Development: IBM offers certifications, learning resources, and a platform to gain industry-recognized skills.","Workplace Culture: The management style I encountered felt rigid and occasionally dismissive of employee concerns. Policies promoting inclusivity and ethical practices were not reflected in the day-to-day environment.
Discrimination Issues: My experience highlighted a concerning level of marginalization and retaliation. IBM's actions during my tenure did not align with the values of equality
Bureaucracy and Inefficiency: Navigating the company's internal systems often felt like an uphill battle, with layers of red tape slowing progress and undermining innovation.
Ethical Inconsistencies: IBM’s policies on issues like vaccination mandates, etc.
Lack of Support for Employees: Efforts to address genuine workplace concerns, such as abusive management and unfair treatment, were met with resistance or outright dismissal, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued."

Senior software developer,2.0,"Mar 12, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years",Ability to work remote. Friendly co-workers.,Most managers were actively doing things to demoralize workers. Seems that the people most likely to be hired as managers are the coldest and least friendly.  Some were outright rude. Workers were pressured not to take vacations or punished for taking earned vacations! This isn't just my opinion. Several co-workers agreed with me.  Most jobs are being outsourced to India or replaced with AI. The idea that this is a US company is wrong. The vast majority of employees now work in India. There's a token number of workers in the US. Of course they look for any excuse to send your job to India without admitting that's their goal. One high level guy who had around dozens and dozens of managers (and three levels of management) below him happened to be Indian. After I left the company I discovered his work experience consisted solely of being a lecturer without a technical degree for 6 years and then he was somehow promoted high into IBM management and was telling technical people what to do. Curious.
Contract management advisor,4.0,"Jan 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","Brilliant people, excellent lower and mid level management. Cutting edge work. Decent, not great, benefits and salary.","Jim Kavanaugh and his colleagues implementing a nonsensical Return to Office policy, with no waivers or exceptions. This is now cascading to all US based jobs, forcing out thousands of great employees. This is a thinly veiled targeted ""layoff"" of the older and higher paid employees, who are less likely to be able to move to a large metropolitan IBM cost center location, without having to declare a layoff or answer to those pesky EEOC issues. This is implemented even against long time fully home based workers who never had an office to ""return"" to. Employees are given 30 days to decide to move, if they are outside a 50-mile radius of the fewer and fewer IBM offices and then drive to that office at least three times per week. No excuses or exceptions. For a global IT company, this is madness. It's just a masked layoff. It's also bad for business, and that's what is so unusual about this--IBM rarely intentionally shoots itself in the foot at point blank range like this. They are bleeding highly competent talent. For a temporary stock bump? Sad."

Good work life balance, though there is now an unnecessary 3x/week RTO mandate. Pay and benefits are not top tier but are decent enough.

Great opportunities to grow and evolve your role. Managers I've had have all been great too; they care about you as a person and want to help you grow even outside IBM. No shortage of mentors at IBM either.

Leadership is accessible and human (CEO office hours ad All hands with Slack Q&As) and is for the most part transparent. Senior leadership takes feedback seriously and acts on it.

If you can design at IBM, which focuses heavily on enterprise design - you can design for a lot of other things. Good opportunity to take ownership and lead projects from the start. 

Work itself is usually the right level of challenging but doable and I'm always learning. The design org is fairly mature and I don't take the incredible Carbon Design System (and its supporting teams) for granted. 

Overall, an excellent place to start your career as a UX designer if you want some structure and mentors and are ok tackling complex enterprise problems.","Lack of diversity and minority representation in senior leadership, so there are not many to look up to higher up. 

Design work is not the most exciting or relatable to the average designer. You have to enjoy ambiguity and be ok navigating around politics / red tape especially when it comes to talking to actual users, which can be frustrating. We also used to have Design researchers embedded in each team... that is no longer the case :( 

Product management is often not empowered to drive features or lead products based on talking directly to customers; they often hear indirectly from CSMs or sales which means a game of telephone and a lot more ""design a vase"" instead of ""design a way to hold flowers"". Makes good user-centered design harder too. We all  often have to make do with proxy users.

3x/week mandate is unnecessary especially since many cross functional teams aren't co-located anyway.

No annual salary raises due to inflation.

Recently, lack of clear company direction or strategy. Seeing a lot of US layoffs (RA's) and moving design roles to India or Budapest, likely to cut costs, along with RTO. We say we're invested in Cloud and AI but I see key roles getting cut like our very important documentation team, and as a result, usability suffers. For example, we now have various AI related services and teams that are doing similar things but are not talking to each other."

For me, it's a choice of $3,000-$4,000 COBRA costs, which disqualify you from obtaining insurance from me and from obtaining reasonable coverage from Healthcare.gov.

---

Working at IBM as a Full Stack Software Engineer was a valuable and enriching chapter in my professional journey. The company offers a unique blend of enterprise stability with a constant push for innovation, especially in areas like cloud computing, AI, and hybrid technologies.

Team & Culture
IBM fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment. I had the opportunity to work alongside talented engineers, product managers, and designers from diverse backgrounds. The culture encourages continuous learning, knowledge sharing, and creative problem-solving, which made for an engaging work atmosphere.

Projects & Impact
During my time at IBM, I worked on end-to-end development of scalable web applications, contributing to both frontend and backend components. I was involved in designing APIs, implementing user interfaces with modern frameworks like React, and building backend services using Node.js. The projects were challenging yet rewarding, and I appreciated how the work directly impacted clients and internal tools at scale.

Learning & Growth
IBM invests significantly in employee development. I had access to a wide range of internal resources, mentorship opportunities, and certification programs. I enhanced my skills in cloud-native technologies, DevOps practices, and agile methodologies. The experience helped me grow both technically and professionally.

Challenges
Like many large organizations, IBM can sometimes have slower decision-making processes due to its scale and structure. Navigating legacy systems alongside modern stacks posed occasional challenges, but it also provided valuable lessons in system integration and refactoring.

**Overall**  
My experience at IBM was overwhelmingly positive. It was a great place to sharpen my full stack skills, work on meaningful projects, and collaborate with intelligent and driven colleagues. I left with a strong foundation in enterprise software development and a deep appreciation for IBM’s commitment to innovation and excellence.","One of the notable challenges at IBM was navigating the bureaucracy that comes with working at a large, legacy enterprise. Decision-making processes could be slow, with multiple layers of approvals often required even for relatively minor changes. This occasionally hampered agility and made it harder to quickly implement innovative ideas or respond to changing requirements. While there’s a strong emphasis on process and compliance—which is understandable at IBM’s scale—it sometimes created friction for fast-paced development and experimentation."
Director,3.0,"Mar 16, 2025",Former employee,IBM offers competitive pay. It's a very large company and you can work there for 2 decades and still not work for every business unit.  It provides you many options to keep evolving as a business professional.  Stocks have also been doing well which is nice for any restricted stocks awarded (you can make a nice sum of money once they vest).,"It's a hierarchal company and unfortunately is very much about who you know which in turn drives promotion or selection of a highly desirable position.  Layoffs are very much happening across the company and not always public knowledge. Work life balance based on my experience was nonexistent. In order to keep up with the demand expected, and succeed it requires you to work late hours and weekends."

Technology, even if it's on your own time, was cool to see it work in real time","Where it went wrong for me was in selling myself. I am in a role as more a consultant than anything else. I have to bid for a position on projects where I am competing with people all across the country, and maybe even the world for one position. If you think you qualify for something, the only thing I'd recommend you to have for when you apply is a portfolio of your work. I didn't and paid the price. Everything else, as far as promotions and seeing how effective you are, rides on working on projects through IBM's clients."

People are put on PIP for unachievable targets that they know you can't meet. However, they will save their friends and people in management cult. Early career professionals jobs will be saved too, even though they don't perform. High PIP rate and inferior territories are given to African Americans. Nepotism runs rampant.

Associate designer,5.0,"Oct 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","They trusted my skills and experiences outside of my age and Psychology major. They hired me based on conversations and demonstrated work, not just paper facts.

My base salary is currently $9,999 per month at 21 years old; I got an 8% raise beginning of the year. I also get ""incentive pay"" (commission) totaling $20-45k annually on top of that as well as a 401k (no matching), retirement account, dental, vision, and healthcare benefits at very reasonable prices.

My first project was with the Fortune 1 company. I now manage the design aspects for 4 high-profile client accounts a year into my job. I am well supported and not overwhelmed. My manager is EXCELLENT and always preaches and acts on family and health coming first over work. I almost never work overtime. Never weekends or after 5pm on a Friday. It's an incredible job fresh out of college and I am very lucky.","I wish the Band promotion process was easier. They recently automated it so it only recommends you for a Designer promotion if you're performing at 132% of quota I believe, eliminating the previous skills test. That was a bad move, pretty much guaranteeing no Designers get promoted.

Also it's hard being gender non-conforming. We need better LGBT community support, resources, and gender-neutral BATHROOMS."

Over 22+ years I've worked with some great people.,"The days of the ""IBMer"" are over. Over the past year and a half, IBM leaders have gone from being ambivalent to being openly hostile towards employees. They eliminated 401k match, eliminated remote work (including for employees who were remote prior to the pandemic), implemented return to office mandates regardless of job role and team structure, conducted multiple layoffs (including three in 2024 and one so far in 2025), forced relocation to high cost locations with the goal of getting older people with families to quit, eliminated employee-friendly perks and benefits, changed the annual employee assessment program multiple times (and now returned to a forced-rank system where 20% of all employees are required to be identified as low performers), stopped all employee spending (including office supplies, keyboard/mouse, travel, etc. Multiple cases of employees being told by their managers to pay for work-related travel out of their own pockets), annual promotion cycle cancelled for two straight years, and the list goes on.

The 2025 GDP and ESP programs (bonus and annual salary increase) were rigged to skip older employees regardless of their 2024 performance ratings ($0 for both bonus and annual salary increase). This was mandated by senior leadership and is blatant age discrimination (which IBM has been successfully sued for multiple times).

There is an aggressive plan to move a significant portion of jobs to India and other ""low cost"" countries. This is ongoing and is planned to continue for the next three years. It will impact employees in all parts of IBM.

Most people I work with come to work every day feeling fear, anxiety, and depression. For all of us, the question isn't ""if"" but ""when"" we will lose our jobs. And there's nothing anyone can do about it - being a top performer, working extra hours, taking on more projects, etc. do not provide any protection.

Even though I still work at IBM (and have for over 20 years), I can no longer recommend IBM as a place that anyone would wish to work. If you're considering coming here, do yourself a favor and DON'T."

Team members who are good at their jobs are like superheroes without capes. When you're part of a good team that is winning clients and closing deals, you feel on top of the world. The technology verticals at IBM are so cool. They support SO MANY businesses, it's hard to wrap your head around. Lots of travel opportunities if you're it. Generally easy to move into new roles from within the company, but you have to prove that you're capable of the new role. I was promoted often. The pay was awesome. Benefits were great. Honestly, I barely have any complaints. They're a great company which is why so many people dedicate their entire careers at IBM.","Lots of ""reorgs."" If IBM doesn't like how a particular strategy is working out in the short to mid-term, they pivot shamelessly. From a leadership perspective, I respect the decisiveness. From an employee perspective, it can leave you changing clients and having to form new relationships all over again.

Uncompetitive technology, and can only acquire tech these days vs. innovating on its own. A lot of big customers are stuck and can't easily dump IBM for another vendor. The company simply cannot get out of its own way. If you're in Sales, your #1 customer will be IBM, i.e. ""what have you done for me lately"".

I was very productive and enjoyed working with colleagues across the globe.

They claim covering increased insurance premiums to be the same as raises, but they just want the tax deduction. They replace senior staff, claiming the costs are too high, with inexperienced new hires. Contracts that were always profitable are suddenly tagged as loosing money, but the costs are normally associated to internal services with inflated pricing or executives listed to accounts that only bill but do no work. There is no job training meaning quality is significantly impacted. Training is primarily for the new sales idea they are pushing, it does not help your work and any substantial training must be done on your own time as they count sick, vacation, holidays, and training against your billable hours.

Automation sales specialist,5.0,"Mar 25, 2024","Current employee, more than 5 years","IBM's training and mentorship are some of the best in the F500 community, and maybe the tech industry as a whole. The people are reasonable, the workload is fast-paced and interesting, but not at the expense of your health. Pay has become more competitive in recent years, leading folks like me to stay for years, even when courted by higher-growth startups. Overall, there's lots to like about IBM.

The new CEO, Arvind Krishna, also seems to have a good handle on what IBM needs to succeed, and he's steering the ship confidently in the right direction, after many years previously of stagnant growth.","Some of the ""old guard"" at IBM are stubborn, resistant to change and adapt to clients' needs. But those folks are starting to leave the company. Sales quotas occasionally can be quite aggressive, but if you are a nice/reasonable person and visibly show effort/hustle, management can be lenient on performance targets. Targets are also subject to change at a moment's notice.

Also, promotions can be extremely slow, and you have to fight for every new career opportunity. Management won't guide you in your career - that's up to you and you alone."

IBM is known for being at the forefront of technology, investing heavily in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cloud services, and data analytics. Working at IBM offers opportunities to engage with cutting-edge technologies and be part of pioneering projects that shape the future.
2. Global Impact

As one of the largest multinational technology companies, IBM provides employees the chance to work on projects with a global reach, serving some of the biggest organizations worldwide. This offers exposure to diverse challenges, industries, and geographies, allowing for significant professional growth and the ability to contribute to impactful solutions.
3. Learning and Development Opportunities

IBM places a strong emphasis on continuous learning. The company offers numerous professional development programs, certifications, and internal training opportunities. Employees are encouraged to enhance their skills and pursue new areas of expertise, fostering career growth and adaptability in a rapidly evolving tech industry.","One potential downside of working at IBM could be bureaucracy and slow decision-making. As a large, established company with a complex organizational structure, decision-making processes can sometimes be slow, and navigating corporate policies can be challenging. This may hinder agility and innovation at certain levels compared to smaller, more nimble companies or startups."

If you are based in the United States, I would give working at IBM a second thought. Moreover, if you are a more senior level employee I would give pause to working at IBM. The focus on ""THINK"" that dominated IBM for decades is out. Now its all about execution, which is fine, but they don't want higher level employees with critical thinking skills.

- Better than average pay and benefits.
- For me personally, I felt valued on my team and like most people really cared.
- They make it a point to be ethical in everything they do, from the way tech is designed and the way employees and customers are treated. I always appreciated that.
- You get to be a part of a world-leading tech team.
- Lots of opportunities for growth and career movement.","- Probably the same type of stuff as any big tech corporation.
- Tons of meetings.
- Few choices in what tools to use. 
- You'll be on IBM cloud instead of AWS which isn't doing your resume any favors.
- I wasn't a fan of the new pension plan (new in 2024 IBM no longer contributes to your 401k, they do this pension plan thing instead)
- It's nearly impossible for the managers to fire non-contributors ... but the catch is there is a (annual? ) round of layoffs. They call it ""RA"" for resource actions. Which always felt like an arbitrary selection of people. I always thought that was stressful because it didn't matter whether you're doing your job or not. Lousy people stayed and good people got let go every time.
- You could be working on a project for 6 months or more, and executives might decide to scrap the whole thing and you just get absorbed into a new team. 
- Uncertain future if you're into remote work. At the time when I left in early 2024, managers were required to come into the office at least 3x per week. Maybe everyone is required now? If not, I have a feeling everyone will be required to come into the office at some point."

Once they have the client's processes and metrics aligned on required service levels, they begin reducing the dedicated experienced Recruiters who were employed with the Client previously in United States to other IBM Recruiters at oversea locations to reduce their overhead salaries and benefits to improve their profit margins. It wasn't a good experience for me since they promoted that coming over to an IBM RPO you would have opportunity to be reassigned to other client accounts when business and economic situations changes.

Senior software engineer,5.0,"Jun 25, 2024","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM is a place that I love to work because the impact that the things that you get to work on is immeasurable. IBM is so involved in many facets of everyone's everyday life and often gets little to no credit for it. 

The company is constantly innovating and coming up with new ways to be relevant in society. 

In addition to all of that I truly believe that IBM often has my best interest in mind and has and will continue to develop me as a professional.","IBM can make various unpopular decisions internally and externally from time to time. Rarely are we caught in serious scandals but things that are popular today like remote work can be a sore subject. 

Although innovation is sought after that unfortunately comes with a lot of churn and change which some people find unsavory. 

IBM is doing its best to reinvent itself and keep the right people on the bus but sometimes due to other factors those people can be deterred from staying at the company."
Managing consultant,4.0,"Dec 6, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Working at IBM offers the opportunity to be part of a global leader in innovation, engaging with cutting-edge technologies like AI, quantum computing, and cloud solutions. The company fosters professional growth through extensive training programs, internal mobility, and a collaborative culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. With a focus on work-life balance, IBM provides flexible working arrangements and a competitive benefits package, including health coverage, retirement plans, and wellness initiatives. Employees also find fulfillment in contributing to IBM’s sustainability and social responsibility efforts, all while building their careers within an iconic organization renowned for its global presence and commitment to excellence.","While IBM offers many advantages, there are some potential challenges to consider. The company’s size and complexity can sometimes result in bureaucratic processes, making decision-making slower than in smaller, more agile organizations. Additionally, while there are numerous opportunities for career growth, navigating IBM’s vast structure to find the right path can be overwhelming. Some employees may also feel that the emphasis on traditional corporate practices and policies limits flexibility in certain roles. Compensation, while competitive, may not always align with industry benchmarks for similar positions at newer tech companies. Furthermore, the company's focus on innovation means that employees are often expected to stay ahead of rapidly changing technologies, which can feel demanding. Lastly, balancing the global nature of the work with personal time zones and schedules may occasionally pose challenges for employees in international roles."

If you go to work there with the attitude, ""What is somebody going to teach me today?"" you'll meet some incredible technical practitioners. You'll keep them in your professional networks forever. for early career, it'll look great on your resume.","Huge cultural shift over the past 0-5 years where the employee is just a commodity. You are nothing else but a commodity. You can be the hardest worker; you can get great performance reviews. But if you're in the wrong place in this vast company, and your data points turn up positive in an algorithm selecting employees for layoff, you will be hit. No quarter. All cards are stacked against you except if you are college hire to mid career lower salary. As an individual contributor (less if you are a manager, but still happens), you will be eventually laid off. So, employee culture is pretty much hollowed out -- lots of grim faces because of the packed conditions in the office, rolling layoffs, and RTO mandates. So sad, but true. I hope IBM can find its way again and start investing in people by letting them grow a career there again. But the powerful short-term (Q2Q) financial chess game rules at IBM. You'll run into some wonderful people there, tho! The best!"

When I joined, I was told about how good the benefits were, and how IBM was a ""family."" In the past few years, that philosophy has been discarded. Every few months upper management makes sweeping policy changes, with no employee input, that significantly hurt US employees. When employees react en masse with concern, alarm, and constructive feedback, they ignore or gaslight us, or commit the strawman fallacy by mischaracterizing employees' concerns and then dismissing them. For example, in November 2023 (right after the employee engagement survey concluded), the did away with 401k matching, replacing it with a novel financial vehicle called an ""RBA"" with much lower yields, and tried to spin it as a good thing for us. Based on publicly available information, I'm estimating that this will probably save IBM at least $100M over the next decade in US benefits payouts. It also means IBM holds our retirement money, rather than the employee. IBM simply does not care about retaining talent right now -- if you are a senior or well-paid employee in the US, they see you as an expense, and they're showing you the door."

Project manager,1.0,"Dec 10, 2024","Former employee, more than 8 years",IBM experience looks decent on a resume.,"If you value your career, mental health, and want to grow at work do yourself a favor and avoid IBM. The culture is broken, the leadership is inept, and your work-life balance will suffer. There are far better tech companies out there where you can actually learn and grow your skills.

Every decision, no matter how minor, requires endless layers of approvals from people who have no real reason to be involved. This causes endless delays on very simple work, a complete lack of autonomy, and a company wide culture of inefficiency. New ideas are immediately shot down because the company is stuck in the past. We constantly lost talented people to better tech companies because they felt undervalued at IBM. 

Management is a joke. Leaders at IBM are out of touch with the day-to-day operations. Management does not help you grow or guide you to become a better employee. The company is led by people who have clearly forgotten what it means to actually lead – they are more focused on surviving layoffs than innovating or supporting their team members. 

At IBM career development is a joke. The company has no clear path for advancement. If you don't keep jumping around expect to be stuck in the same position for years, doing the same mind-numbing tasks with no hope of getting ahead.

Toxicity runs rampant at IBM. Expect to be constantly overworked and undervalued, with little to no recognition for the effort you put in. If your manager doesn't like you expect to be blocked from meetings and pertinent information until you eventually get laid off. Morale is at an all-time low, most people are looking to leave for another job/opportunity to escape.

In terms of compensation IBM is behind other tech companies. Forget about sign on bonuses, yearly bonuses or pay raises – they are non-existent, or at best, an afterthought. Some IBM orgs offer 2% - 3% pay raise yearly which is not enough to keep up with cost of living. 

Working at a tech company like IBM means you're stuck using outdated tech. The company’s focus is no longer on innovation, but on milking outdated products for as long as possible. Don’t expect to work on anything exciting or new. IBM can’t keep up with the tech landscape and as a result your skills and career will stagnate."

Digital sales transformation leader,3.0,"Oct 25, 2024","Former employee, more than 5 years","The legacy of great innovation still exists within small, siloed pockets of the large, albeit shrinking, company. Furthermore, IBM has a history of employing exceptionally smart and talented individuals. Finally, IBM has been hiring more young talent as a way to not only save money (less expensive staff) but also to build a new cadre of talented IBMers.","IBM, once a dominant force in the tech industry, has experienced a decline in its leadership position over the past few decades. While the company has invested heavily in emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing, its strategic decisions and organizational culture have contributed to its challenges.
IBM's revenue peaked in 2012 at $104.5 billion and has since declined to $61.86 billion in 2023.
IBM has a history of significant layoffs, often targeting experienced and high-performing employees. These layoffs can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and innovation, hindering the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions. In 2023 alone, IBM announced layoffs of around 3,900 employees, with plans for further cuts involving 8,000 roles by automating positions through AI. In 2024, thousands more senior skilled staff were laid off who were in the Band 10 (the highest pay grade before Executive pay bands) pay range in order to reduce expensive, talented employees in an effort to artificially boost the company's profits.
 IBM’s network and firmware are often outdated, with some software no longer supported by vendors. This reliance on aging tech infrastructure, compounded by offshoring, has made it harder for IBM to implement updates or compete effectively on cutting-edge services.
IBM’s commitment to AI and quantum computing, while substantial, has struggled to yield competitive financial returns, partly due to the company’s conservative approaches to AI applications, cost-focused layoffs, and reliance on outdated infrastructure.
Large amounts of technical debt and aging infrastructure prove difficult to connect shared data sources, leading to multiple ""sources of truth"" for data, which degrades the IBMer's ability to be efficient and highly productive.
Finally, while IBM was a pioneer in cloud computing, it was slow to adopt a cloud-first strategy, allowing competitors like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to gain significant market share."

Some employees may feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure.

Limited Work-Life Balance: In certain roles or during demanding projects, employees might find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long working hours and tight deadlines may contribute to this issue.

Bureaucracy: Large organizations often have established bureaucratic processes, which could lead to delays in decision-making and project execution. Navigating through these processes might be cumbersome for some employees.

Limited Managerial Support: Your experience of feeling overworked without sufficient support from management is a common concern in various workplaces. In a large company, communication channels can sometimes be complex, and individual experiences may differ based on teams and managers.

Emphasis on Metrics: Some employees may feel that the company places a strong emphasis on metrics and performance indicators, which could potentially impact the work environment and stress levels.

Limited Flexibility: Depending on the role and team, some employees might find that the company has a more structured and less flexible approach to work arrangements.

Communication Challenges: In a large organization, communication can sometimes be a challenge. Important information might not always be effectively communicated across teams, leading to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity."

Terrible place to work for engineers in general but female engineers specifically. Male colleagues make way more, are offered stock, and sign-on bonuses. When asking for the same, management tells you IBM does not do such things. Which is a complete lie. Spent 8 years working for this company only to find out these things later on and immediately deciding to leave. Worked towards a promotion for 3 years and only was told I should have gotten it 3 years prior when I decided to quit. Save yourself the time. They have no clear goals and are just headed down the drain. Their HR is completely messed up, basically non-existent. Worked there for 8 years and they asked for money back for ""overpayment"" or they would send me to collections. Am looking into a lawyer to deal with the discrimination and terrible behavior."

They really are walking the talk when it comes to how best to provide feedback in a fast-moving, social environment.  While the outside debate rages on about the value of performance management systems, IBM has done something about it, and has spent time listening to employees and incorporating their feedback into the design elements of the new system. No more forced distribution, with multiple touchpoints during the year and a human-scale time horizon around goal-setting and goal attainment.  All around, this is one of the best approaches to performance management that I've seen.",We'll wait to see how well managers can incorporate this.

It's a cold, cold place where the only measure of worth seems to be billable hours. No place for people like us who were paid out of overhead to develop managed services and offer them to the world.

For mature teams (support teams of stable offerings, who'd each in their field 10-25+ years) - forcing a ""low performer"" to meet a quota when there really was no differentiator, was too close to a lie for me.

Empowering Work Environment: IBM encourages a culture of autonomy and responsibility, where employees are empowered to make decisions, innovate, and push the boundaries of technology.
Working at IBM provides opportunities to contribute to high-impact projects, grow professionally, and be part of a dynamic global team.","1. Bureaucracy and Slow Decision-Making
Large Company Structure: As a massive, global organization with over 350,000 employees, IBM can sometimes suffer from slow decision-making processes and bureaucratic hurdles. It can take time to get approvals or push through initiatives, which may frustrate employees looking for agility and speed in their work.
Complex Organizational Layers: The multi-layered hierarchy may make it difficult to implement changes or navigate internal structures.
2. Frequent Restructuring and Layoffs
Ongoing Restructuring: IBM has undergone several rounds of restructuring and realignment in recent years to focus on cloud computing and AI. While this shift is strategic, it has led to frequent layoffs and uncertainty in certain divisions.
Job Security Concerns: Due to these periodic layoffs, employees may feel insecure about their positions, particularly in legacy business units like hardware or traditional IT services.
3. Compensation and Raises
Slow Salary Growth: Some employees report that salary increases and promotions can be slow to materialize, particularly when compared to competitors in the tech industry. Merit-based raises are sometimes modest, despite high performance.
Below-Average Pay in Some Regions: Depending on location and role, IBM's base salary may not always be competitive with other major tech companies, especially for junior or mid-level employees.
4. Work-Life Balance
Long Hours in Some Roles: While IBM does offer remote and flexible work options, some employees, particularly in client-facing or high-pressure roles, report long hours and heavy workloads. The balance between work and personal life can be challenging in certain departments.
Global Teams: Employees working with international teams may have to deal with time zone differences, leading to meetings or tasks outside of standard working hours.
5. Legacy Systems and Technology
Outdated Technology in Certain Areas: Despite its focus on innovation, IBM still has divisions dealing with older, legacy systems and technologies. Working on these systems may not be as exciting or fulfilling for employees looking to engage with cutting-edge projects.
Transition to Cloud: IBM is still in the process of pivoting to become a cloud-first company. Some teams are caught between maintaining legacy systems and transitioning to modern platforms, which can be difficult to navigate.
6. Pace of Innovation
Slow Adoption of New Technologies: In some cases, IBM's size and bureaucracy can slow down the adoption of newer technologies or agile practices, making it harder to keep up with fast-moving trends in the tech industry.
Resistance to Change: Legacy teams or more traditional areas of the company may resist newer, more modern methods of working, such as DevOps or agile practices, which can frustrate employees looking to innovate.
7. Limited Career Advancement
Limited Mobility in Certain Divisions: While IBM offers many training and learning opportunities, some employees report that career advancement can be slow, especially in non-technical or support roles.
Competition for Promotions: Due to the company's size, competition for leadership roles or promotions can be stiff, and upward mobility may be more challenging in saturated areas.
8. Complex Internal Tools and Processes
Complicated Internal Systems: Employees have reported that internal systems (such as HR tools, approval workflows, and internal communication platforms) can be outdated or overly complex, which can hamper productivity.
Inefficient Processes: Navigating IBM’s processes, from project management to performance evaluations, may feel inefficient, especially compared to more streamlined, agile environments in smaller companies.
9. Focus on Legacy Clients
Older Client Base: Some employees may find that much of the company's business still revolves around maintaining legacy clients or contracts, particularly in industries like finance, government, or healthcare. This focus may limit exposure to exciting, new industries or projects.
10. Cultural Divide Across Teams
Varied Experience Based on Department: The culture at IBM can vary significantly from one department or location to another. Employees in newer, cloud-focused divisions might have a more dynamic, innovative environment compared to those in traditional, more bureaucratic areas.
International Differences: Because IBM is a global company, employees may experience cultural and communication differences when collaborating with teams in different countries."

Both leaders realized that the top IT companies in the world had deep in investment in design and UX research. For 7 years or so, IBM was a wonderful place to work. I had a future and I had hope. I worked with great people.","But Ginni failed to increase revenue. 

Arvind Krishna was put in place, a mustachioed little man, Jack Welch's Indian 8th cousin on his mother's side, with a drive to increase revenue at all cost. He got the stock price to record levels. Yay. 

But Arvind has destroyed IBM's culture. The design program was laid waste. Phil Gilbert and even his successor was let go. Now the company is being managed by this visionless egomaniac who has staked IBM's entire future on a sad stack of AI solutions that previously he himself had left on a shelf as irrelevant. He has done all he can to make IBM a dividend stock anyone would want, and he didn't care how many IBmers he'd have to step over to get there. 

IBM is a truly awful place to work now. And the man lies as much as Donald Trump - pretending the endless layoffs he has instituted is to due to ""AI"" - when what that really means is ""All India"" as he relentlessly outsources and American jobs to his home county and lying that it is because of IBM's great AI tech.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 9, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Coworkers were *mostly* nice. Management was kind, if not always competent.
People that don't work at IBM and aren't in the tech industry think it's a prestigious company.","Several coworkers were just outright rude, hostile and almost insufferable to work with. They often seemed angry and bitter and I didn't want to turn into them.
Management seemed detached, disinterested in the job and basically already retired, zero advocacy for me as person or interest in my professional growth and development.
Good work always just brought heap loads more of the same drudgery. Innovation was rejected immediately, ""that's a great idea, and you're right, but IBM will never do that,"" was a common reply. 
Other teams and departments were hard to work with, often not responding in a timely manner and requiring constant hand holding and follow up to get anything done. I got the impression the organization was disintegrating and no one knew what they were doing or wanted to do it anymore.
Arvind was an impersonable jerk that doesn't care about his employees. 
Benefits were not good and getting worse every year.
Salary was bottom of the market and they always wanted me to work on holidays while all the execs were out. Thanksgiving and New Year's especially. 
They only paid agile lip service.
Their tools were the worst things I've ever used in my entire life. I'm sure they were once cutting edge, back in 1988.
Management could often not be reached and refused to commit to more than one or two stand ups a week. 
Often took at least a quarter to get anything done, and more often than it ever should did it take six months to one year. 
They just relentlessly pile work on you. It never ended. Was so glad when I got an offer at a smaller, faster company that paid top of the market and offered better benefits and am able to do more work in less time and on my own time table.
Most of their revenue growth appeared to be just accounting gimmicks. They're just sucking big blue dry of every last drop for their investors and then it'll die off.
Lots of that terrible fake inclusion stuff like having a taco day for Hispanic culture (I'm not even kidding).
Totally incapable of functioning as a remote company, of course they wanted everyone to go back to the office they literally couldn't operate any other way - management might have to actually do their job in a remote setting.
The company is the laughing stock of its peers. The WalMart of tech companies."

I watched directors harrass sales representatives, show favoritism and engage in retaliation and nothing was done about it."

Senior software engineer,2.0,"Nov 21, 2023","Current employee, more than 8 years","When you have a great manager that protects you from upper management nonsense, its great","Here's the real reason I'm posting.

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary. The downside is two-fold, returns in the RBA pegged at 3% and you have zero choice in how its invested. If you're early to mid career this is a massive loss. Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

2. The return to office is extremely sloppy, sites not having enough workspace, ""come into the office or resign"" ultimatums...all of this because of poor planning"
