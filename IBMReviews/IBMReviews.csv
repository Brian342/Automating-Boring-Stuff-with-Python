Anonymous employee,5.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Empathetic leadership and an inspiring, organization-wide commitment to improvement.","When role boundaries are unclear, you may be required to handle work outside your expertise—an especially daunting prospect when critical issues demand immediate attention."
Advisory engineer,4.0,"Aug 26, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 
1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 

4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come..."
Ibm cloud sales,4.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","I have truly enjoyed my time working at IBM, especially the training opportunities and benefits provided. It’s a company that invests in its employees and offers great development programs.","Recently, I’ve observed some changes in how roles and compensation are handled. Some senior leaders have been reassigned to lower roles, and there have been salary adjustments, including reductions for those with extensive experience. 

For someone motivated by promotion and salary growth, IBM might not currently be the best place, as the company seems to be focusing on hiring younger talent at lower salaries, while experienced employees are experiencing cuts. Nonetheless, IBM remains a respected company with many strengths, but it's important to be aware of these recent changes."
Customer success manager - architect,3.0,"Jun 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years","Exceptional pay and benefits. Great people, great customers.","- Heavy organizational ""tech debt"" drives down efficiency and job satisfaction. 
- Customer Success is not truly customer success - it's an organization created as a reaction to an inability to deploy products from Enterprise License Agreements. The primary mission of CS at IBM is to identify use cases, sponsors, budget, and gain commitment to deploy software from ELAs. Those are PRE-sale activities, not POST-sale CS activities. Just because an ELA was sold does not mean things are actually post-sale. An ELA is just a contract vehicle to buy something in the future, a gift card sold at a discount, all the normal sales activities still need to happen. 
- Sr. team members are being let go in favor of inexpensive, inexperienced new hires."
Application developer 2,4.0,"Jun 11, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Out the gate, IBM educational material teaches you all about how to be an impactful player as part of an active tech business. You will have reviews of updated material on how to conduct business with others professionally. On a monthly basis you'll have access to C-suite thought leadership statements and chats, and I have even participated in chats where the CEO of the company will voice his opinion on the goings on in tech news as it relates to IBM.

The location selected is a location in WV nearby to where I am employed, as my actual location was not selectable among provided Glassdoor options.","IBM is a big business, and sometimes promotion can seem years away from actualizing due to the changing structure of the company in the big tech boom times we are in. As a young player myself, the desire to self-educate and become more productive with practice and experimentation can sometimes compete with the need to deliver products on a team. I think the company makes it hard sometimes to balance the two, and when you have to do both, you have to work a heavy load of hours to accomplish it all."
Progammer,3.0,"Jun 25, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","You will get experience working in multiple fields 

You will build up tech experience as well as soft skills. This is a good place to start if you do not have better offers, right off the college (especially if you are local or you don't have much experience in IT and you want to have a recognizable name on your resume 

Opportunities for training like Udemy business accounts as well as certifications. IBM proper also have a load of training. 

Decent work-life balance if you have a project. 

Hybrid model is good at CIC. Three days are required at office as long as you have a project.","Very hard to get promoted 

The consulting sector is very chaotic at IBM. 

Expectations are not always clear. 

Project Leadership is lacking too often on multiple projects. 

Pays lower than most other IT companies.

Whatever you do, if you work at a CIC at IBM, you have to get off the bench as fast as possible, however you will have to fight for work compared to another company where they will give you work."

Consultant,2.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Decent work life balance
Remote work for consulting (at the moment)","Revenue is being driven by outsourcing labor to india so that leadership can keep their hefty paychecks while the lower class get laid off. IBM consulting consistently posts <2% rev growth per year. This is not a place you want to invest in unless it is your only option.

Early career consultants - stay away."

• Strong learning opportunities through programs like Developer Jumpstart and hands-on complex projects
• Autonomy and trust - no micromanagement, allowing developers to work independently
• Comprehensive development process from research to deployment with proper testing protocols
• Opportunity to work on challenging, mission-critical systems that build strong technical foundations
• Recognition for good work through equity awards and peer appreciation","• Steep learning curve due to heavy reliance on proprietary technologies that aren't transferable
• Poor documentation organization makes problem-solving time-consuming and frustrating
• Limited ability to use modern tools and frameworks due to legacy system constraints
• Difficult to find solutions online since most tech stack is IBM-specific rather than industry-standard
• Fast-paced environment can be overwhelming initially, especially for new developers"

However, my personal experience has exposed significant internal challenges that contradict its outward reputation as a forward-thinking and ethical company. While IBM offers many opportunities, its corporate culture and policies may not align with the ideals it publicly espouses.

Global Expertise: IBM has a wealth of talented professionals and innovative technologies. Working here provides exposure to cutting-edge solutions and opportunities for global collaboration.
Diverse Projects: The scope of projects, especially in fields like AI, cloud computing, and enterprise solutions, is vast and can be intellectually stimulating.
Professional Development: IBM offers certifications, learning resources, and a platform to gain industry-recognized skills.","Workplace Culture: The management style I encountered felt rigid and occasionally dismissive of employee concerns. Policies promoting inclusivity and ethical practices were not reflected in the day-to-day environment.
Discrimination Issues: My experience highlighted a concerning level of marginalization and retaliation. IBM's actions during my tenure did not align with the values of equality
Bureaucracy and Inefficiency: Navigating the company's internal systems often felt like an uphill battle, with layers of red tape slowing progress and undermining innovation.
Ethical Inconsistencies: IBM’s policies on issues like vaccination mandates, etc.
Lack of Support for Employees: Efforts to address genuine workplace concerns, such as abusive management and unfair treatment, were met with resistance or outright dismissal, leaving employees feeling unsupported and undervalued."

Senior software developer,2.0,"Mar 12, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years",Ability to work remote. Friendly co-workers.,Most managers were actively doing things to demoralize workers. Seems that the people most likely to be hired as managers are the coldest and least friendly.  Some were outright rude. Workers were pressured not to take vacations or punished for taking earned vacations! This isn't just my opinion. Several co-workers agreed with me.  Most jobs are being outsourced to India or replaced with AI. The idea that this is a US company is wrong. The vast majority of employees now work in India. There's a token number of workers in the US. Of course they look for any excuse to send your job to India without admitting that's their goal. One high level guy who had around dozens and dozens of managers (and three levels of management) below him happened to be Indian. After I left the company I discovered his work experience consisted solely of being a lecturer without a technical degree for 6 years and then he was somehow promoted high into IBM management and was telling technical people what to do. Curious.
Contract management advisor,4.0,"Jan 23, 2025","Current employee, more than 5 years","Brilliant people, excellent lower and mid level management. Cutting edge work. Decent, not great, benefits and salary.","Jim Kavanaugh and his colleagues implementing a nonsensical Return to Office policy, with no waivers or exceptions. This is now cascading to all US based jobs, forcing out thousands of great employees. This is a thinly veiled targeted ""layoff"" of the older and higher paid employees, who are less likely to be able to move to a large metropolitan IBM cost center location, without having to declare a layoff or answer to those pesky EEOC issues. This is implemented even against long time fully home based workers who never had an office to ""return"" to. Employees are given 30 days to decide to move, if they are outside a 50-mile radius of the fewer and fewer IBM offices and then drive to that office at least three times per week. No excuses or exceptions. For a global IT company, this is madness. It's just a masked layoff. It's also bad for business, and that's what is so unusual about this--IBM rarely intentionally shoots itself in the foot at point blank range like this. They are bleeding highly competent talent. For a temporary stock bump? Sad."

Good work life balance, though there is now an unnecessary 3x/week RTO mandate. Pay and benefits are not top tier but are decent enough.

Great opportunities to grow and evolve your role. Managers I've had have all been great too; they care about you as a person and want to help you grow even outside IBM. No shortage of mentors at IBM either.

Leadership is accessible and human (CEO office hours ad All hands with Slack Q&As) and is for the most part transparent. Senior leadership takes feedback seriously and acts on it.

If you can design at IBM, which focuses heavily on enterprise design - you can design for a lot of other things. Good opportunity to take ownership and lead projects from the start. 

Work itself is usually the right level of challenging but doable and I'm always learning. The design org is fairly mature and I don't take the incredible Carbon Design System (and its supporting teams) for granted. 

Overall, an excellent place to start your career as a UX designer if you want some structure and mentors and are ok tackling complex enterprise problems.","Lack of diversity and minority representation in senior leadership, so there are not many to look up to higher up. 

Design work is not the most exciting or relatable to the average designer. You have to enjoy ambiguity and be ok navigating around politics / red tape especially when it comes to talking to actual users, which can be frustrating. We also used to have Design researchers embedded in each team... that is no longer the case :( 

Product management is often not empowered to drive features or lead products based on talking directly to customers; they often hear indirectly from CSMs or sales which means a game of telephone and a lot more ""design a vase"" instead of ""design a way to hold flowers"". Makes good user-centered design harder too. We all  often have to make do with proxy users.

3x/week mandate is unnecessary especially since many cross functional teams aren't co-located anyway.

No annual salary raises due to inflation.

Recently, lack of clear company direction or strategy. Seeing a lot of US layoffs (RA's) and moving design roles to India or Budapest, likely to cut costs, along with RTO. We say we're invested in Cloud and AI but I see key roles getting cut like our very important documentation team, and as a result, usability suffers. For example, we now have various AI related services and teams that are doing similar things but are not talking to each other."

For me, it's a choice of $3,000-$4,000 COBRA costs, which disqualify you from obtaining insurance from me and from obtaining reasonable coverage from Healthcare.gov.

---

Working at IBM as a Full Stack Software Engineer was a valuable and enriching chapter in my professional journey. The company offers a unique blend of enterprise stability with a constant push for innovation, especially in areas like cloud computing, AI, and hybrid technologies.

Team & Culture
IBM fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment. I had the opportunity to work alongside talented engineers, product managers, and designers from diverse backgrounds. The culture encourages continuous learning, knowledge sharing, and creative problem-solving, which made for an engaging work atmosphere.

Projects & Impact
During my time at IBM, I worked on end-to-end development of scalable web applications, contributing to both frontend and backend components. I was involved in designing APIs, implementing user interfaces with modern frameworks like React, and building backend services using Node.js. The projects were challenging yet rewarding, and I appreciated how the work directly impacted clients and internal tools at scale.

Learning & Growth
IBM invests significantly in employee development. I had access to a wide range of internal resources, mentorship opportunities, and certification programs. I enhanced my skills in cloud-native technologies, DevOps practices, and agile methodologies. The experience helped me grow both technically and professionally.

Challenges
Like many large organizations, IBM can sometimes have slower decision-making processes due to its scale and structure. Navigating legacy systems alongside modern stacks posed occasional challenges, but it also provided valuable lessons in system integration and refactoring.

**Overall**  
My experience at IBM was overwhelmingly positive. It was a great place to sharpen my full stack skills, work on meaningful projects, and collaborate with intelligent and driven colleagues. I left with a strong foundation in enterprise software development and a deep appreciation for IBM’s commitment to innovation and excellence.","One of the notable challenges at IBM was navigating the bureaucracy that comes with working at a large, legacy enterprise. Decision-making processes could be slow, with multiple layers of approvals often required even for relatively minor changes. This occasionally hampered agility and made it harder to quickly implement innovative ideas or respond to changing requirements. While there’s a strong emphasis on process and compliance—which is understandable at IBM’s scale—it sometimes created friction for fast-paced development and experimentation."
Director,3.0,"Mar 16, 2025",Former employee,IBM offers competitive pay. It's a very large company and you can work there for 2 decades and still not work for every business unit.  It provides you many options to keep evolving as a business professional.  Stocks have also been doing well which is nice for any restricted stocks awarded (you can make a nice sum of money once they vest).,"It's a hierarchal company and unfortunately is very much about who you know which in turn drives promotion or selection of a highly desirable position.  Layoffs are very much happening across the company and not always public knowledge. Work life balance based on my experience was nonexistent. In order to keep up with the demand expected, and succeed it requires you to work late hours and weekends."

Technology, even if it's on your own time, was cool to see it work in real time","Where it went wrong for me was in selling myself. I am in a role as more a consultant than anything else. I have to bid for a position on projects where I am competing with people all across the country, and maybe even the world for one position. If you think you qualify for something, the only thing I'd recommend you to have for when you apply is a portfolio of your work. I didn't and paid the price. Everything else, as far as promotions and seeing how effective you are, rides on working on projects through IBM's clients."

People are put on PIP for unachievable targets that they know you can't meet. However, they will save their friends and people in management cult. Early career professionals jobs will be saved too, even though they don't perform. High PIP rate and inferior territories are given to African Americans. Nepotism runs rampant.

Associate designer,5.0,"Oct 22, 2024","Current employee, more than 1 year","They trusted my skills and experiences outside of my age and Psychology major. They hired me based on conversations and demonstrated work, not just paper facts.

My base salary is currently $9,999 per month at 21 years old; I got an 8% raise beginning of the year. I also get ""incentive pay"" (commission) totaling $20-45k annually on top of that as well as a 401k (no matching), retirement account, dental, vision, and healthcare benefits at very reasonable prices.

My first project was with the Fortune 1 company. I now manage the design aspects for 4 high-profile client accounts a year into my job. I am well supported and not overwhelmed. My manager is EXCELLENT and always preaches and acts on family and health coming first over work. I almost never work overtime. Never weekends or after 5pm on a Friday. It's an incredible job fresh out of college and I am very lucky.","I wish the Band promotion process was easier. They recently automated it so it only recommends you for a Designer promotion if you're performing at 132% of quota I believe, eliminating the previous skills test. That was a bad move, pretty much guaranteeing no Designers get promoted.

Also it's hard being gender non-conforming. We need better LGBT community support, resources, and gender-neutral BATHROOMS."

Over 22+ years I've worked with some great people.,"The days of the ""IBMer"" are over. Over the past year and a half, IBM leaders have gone from being ambivalent to being openly hostile towards employees. They eliminated 401k match, eliminated remote work (including for employees who were remote prior to the pandemic), implemented return to office mandates regardless of job role and team structure, conducted multiple layoffs (including three in 2024 and one so far in 2025), forced relocation to high cost locations with the goal of getting older people with families to quit, eliminated employee-friendly perks and benefits, changed the annual employee assessment program multiple times (and now returned to a forced-rank system where 20% of all employees are required to be identified as low performers), stopped all employee spending (including office supplies, keyboard/mouse, travel, etc. Multiple cases of employees being told by their managers to pay for work-related travel out of their own pockets), annual promotion cycle cancelled for two straight years, and the list goes on.

The 2025 GDP and ESP programs (bonus and annual salary increase) were rigged to skip older employees regardless of their 2024 performance ratings ($0 for both bonus and annual salary increase). This was mandated by senior leadership and is blatant age discrimination (which IBM has been successfully sued for multiple times).

There is an aggressive plan to move a significant portion of jobs to India and other ""low cost"" countries. This is ongoing and is planned to continue for the next three years. It will impact employees in all parts of IBM.

Most people I work with come to work every day feeling fear, anxiety, and depression. For all of us, the question isn't ""if"" but ""when"" we will lose our jobs. And there's nothing anyone can do about it - being a top performer, working extra hours, taking on more projects, etc. do not provide any protection.

Even though I still work at IBM (and have for over 20 years), I can no longer recommend IBM as a place that anyone would wish to work. If you're considering coming here, do yourself a favor and DON'T."

Team members who are good at their jobs are like superheroes without capes. When you're part of a good team that is winning clients and closing deals, you feel on top of the world. The technology verticals at IBM are so cool. They support SO MANY businesses, it's hard to wrap your head around. Lots of travel opportunities if you're it. Generally easy to move into new roles from within the company, but you have to prove that you're capable of the new role. I was promoted often. The pay was awesome. Benefits were great. Honestly, I barely have any complaints. They're a great company which is why so many people dedicate their entire careers at IBM.","Lots of ""reorgs."" If IBM doesn't like how a particular strategy is working out in the short to mid-term, they pivot shamelessly. From a leadership perspective, I respect the decisiveness. From an employee perspective, it can leave you changing clients and having to form new relationships all over again.

Uncompetitive technology, and can only acquire tech these days vs. innovating on its own. A lot of big customers are stuck and can't easily dump IBM for another vendor. The company simply cannot get out of its own way. If you're in Sales, your #1 customer will be IBM, i.e. ""what have you done for me lately"".

I was very productive and enjoyed working with colleagues across the globe.

They claim covering increased insurance premiums to be the same as raises, but they just want the tax deduction. They replace senior staff, claiming the costs are too high, with inexperienced new hires. Contracts that were always profitable are suddenly tagged as loosing money, but the costs are normally associated to internal services with inflated pricing or executives listed to accounts that only bill but do no work. There is no job training meaning quality is significantly impacted. Training is primarily for the new sales idea they are pushing, it does not help your work and any substantial training must be done on your own time as they count sick, vacation, holidays, and training against your billable hours.

Automation sales specialist,5.0,"Mar 25, 2024","Current employee, more than 5 years","IBM's training and mentorship are some of the best in the F500 community, and maybe the tech industry as a whole. The people are reasonable, the workload is fast-paced and interesting, but not at the expense of your health. Pay has become more competitive in recent years, leading folks like me to stay for years, even when courted by higher-growth startups. Overall, there's lots to like about IBM.

The new CEO, Arvind Krishna, also seems to have a good handle on what IBM needs to succeed, and he's steering the ship confidently in the right direction, after many years previously of stagnant growth.","Some of the ""old guard"" at IBM are stubborn, resistant to change and adapt to clients' needs. But those folks are starting to leave the company. Sales quotas occasionally can be quite aggressive, but if you are a nice/reasonable person and visibly show effort/hustle, management can be lenient on performance targets. Targets are also subject to change at a moment's notice.

Also, promotions can be extremely slow, and you have to fight for every new career opportunity. Management won't guide you in your career - that's up to you and you alone."

IBM is known for being at the forefront of technology, investing heavily in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cloud services, and data analytics. Working at IBM offers opportunities to engage with cutting-edge technologies and be part of pioneering projects that shape the future.
2. Global Impact

As one of the largest multinational technology companies, IBM provides employees the chance to work on projects with a global reach, serving some of the biggest organizations worldwide. This offers exposure to diverse challenges, industries, and geographies, allowing for significant professional growth and the ability to contribute to impactful solutions.
3. Learning and Development Opportunities

IBM places a strong emphasis on continuous learning. The company offers numerous professional development programs, certifications, and internal training opportunities. Employees are encouraged to enhance their skills and pursue new areas of expertise, fostering career growth and adaptability in a rapidly evolving tech industry.","One potential downside of working at IBM could be bureaucracy and slow decision-making. As a large, established company with a complex organizational structure, decision-making processes can sometimes be slow, and navigating corporate policies can be challenging. This may hinder agility and innovation at certain levels compared to smaller, more nimble companies or startups."

If you are based in the United States, I would give working at IBM a second thought. Moreover, if you are a more senior level employee I would give pause to working at IBM. The focus on ""THINK"" that dominated IBM for decades is out. Now its all about execution, which is fine, but they don't want higher level employees with critical thinking skills.

- Better than average pay and benefits.
- For me personally, I felt valued on my team and like most people really cared.
- They make it a point to be ethical in everything they do, from the way tech is designed and the way employees and customers are treated. I always appreciated that.
- You get to be a part of a world-leading tech team.
- Lots of opportunities for growth and career movement.","- Probably the same type of stuff as any big tech corporation.
- Tons of meetings.
- Few choices in what tools to use. 
- You'll be on IBM cloud instead of AWS which isn't doing your resume any favors.
- I wasn't a fan of the new pension plan (new in 2024 IBM no longer contributes to your 401k, they do this pension plan thing instead)
- It's nearly impossible for the managers to fire non-contributors ... but the catch is there is a (annual? ) round of layoffs. They call it ""RA"" for resource actions. Which always felt like an arbitrary selection of people. I always thought that was stressful because it didn't matter whether you're doing your job or not. Lousy people stayed and good people got let go every time.
- You could be working on a project for 6 months or more, and executives might decide to scrap the whole thing and you just get absorbed into a new team. 
- Uncertain future if you're into remote work. At the time when I left in early 2024, managers were required to come into the office at least 3x per week. Maybe everyone is required now? If not, I have a feeling everyone will be required to come into the office at some point."

Once they have the client's processes and metrics aligned on required service levels, they begin reducing the dedicated experienced Recruiters who were employed with the Client previously in United States to other IBM Recruiters at oversea locations to reduce their overhead salaries and benefits to improve their profit margins. It wasn't a good experience for me since they promoted that coming over to an IBM RPO you would have opportunity to be reassigned to other client accounts when business and economic situations changes.

Senior software engineer,5.0,"Jun 25, 2024","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM is a place that I love to work because the impact that the things that you get to work on is immeasurable. IBM is so involved in many facets of everyone's everyday life and often gets little to no credit for it. 

The company is constantly innovating and coming up with new ways to be relevant in society. 

In addition to all of that I truly believe that IBM often has my best interest in mind and has and will continue to develop me as a professional.","IBM can make various unpopular decisions internally and externally from time to time. Rarely are we caught in serious scandals but things that are popular today like remote work can be a sore subject. 

Although innovation is sought after that unfortunately comes with a lot of churn and change which some people find unsavory. 

IBM is doing its best to reinvent itself and keep the right people on the bus but sometimes due to other factors those people can be deterred from staying at the company."
Managing consultant,4.0,"Dec 6, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Working at IBM offers the opportunity to be part of a global leader in innovation, engaging with cutting-edge technologies like AI, quantum computing, and cloud solutions. The company fosters professional growth through extensive training programs, internal mobility, and a collaborative culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion. With a focus on work-life balance, IBM provides flexible working arrangements and a competitive benefits package, including health coverage, retirement plans, and wellness initiatives. Employees also find fulfillment in contributing to IBM’s sustainability and social responsibility efforts, all while building their careers within an iconic organization renowned for its global presence and commitment to excellence.","While IBM offers many advantages, there are some potential challenges to consider. The company’s size and complexity can sometimes result in bureaucratic processes, making decision-making slower than in smaller, more agile organizations. Additionally, while there are numerous opportunities for career growth, navigating IBM’s vast structure to find the right path can be overwhelming. Some employees may also feel that the emphasis on traditional corporate practices and policies limits flexibility in certain roles. Compensation, while competitive, may not always align with industry benchmarks for similar positions at newer tech companies. Furthermore, the company's focus on innovation means that employees are often expected to stay ahead of rapidly changing technologies, which can feel demanding. Lastly, balancing the global nature of the work with personal time zones and schedules may occasionally pose challenges for employees in international roles."

If you go to work there with the attitude, ""What is somebody going to teach me today?"" you'll meet some incredible technical practitioners. You'll keep them in your professional networks forever. for early career, it'll look great on your resume.","Huge cultural shift over the past 0-5 years where the employee is just a commodity. You are nothing else but a commodity. You can be the hardest worker; you can get great performance reviews. But if you're in the wrong place in this vast company, and your data points turn up positive in an algorithm selecting employees for layoff, you will be hit. No quarter. All cards are stacked against you except if you are college hire to mid career lower salary. As an individual contributor (less if you are a manager, but still happens), you will be eventually laid off. So, employee culture is pretty much hollowed out -- lots of grim faces because of the packed conditions in the office, rolling layoffs, and RTO mandates. So sad, but true. I hope IBM can find its way again and start investing in people by letting them grow a career there again. But the powerful short-term (Q2Q) financial chess game rules at IBM. You'll run into some wonderful people there, tho! The best!"

When I joined, I was told about how good the benefits were, and how IBM was a ""family."" In the past few years, that philosophy has been discarded. Every few months upper management makes sweeping policy changes, with no employee input, that significantly hurt US employees. When employees react en masse with concern, alarm, and constructive feedback, they ignore or gaslight us, or commit the strawman fallacy by mischaracterizing employees' concerns and then dismissing them. For example, in November 2023 (right after the employee engagement survey concluded), the did away with 401k matching, replacing it with a novel financial vehicle called an ""RBA"" with much lower yields, and tried to spin it as a good thing for us. Based on publicly available information, I'm estimating that this will probably save IBM at least $100M over the next decade in US benefits payouts. It also means IBM holds our retirement money, rather than the employee. IBM simply does not care about retaining talent right now -- if you are a senior or well-paid employee in the US, they see you as an expense, and they're showing you the door."

Project manager,1.0,"Dec 10, 2024","Former employee, more than 8 years",IBM experience looks decent on a resume.,"If you value your career, mental health, and want to grow at work do yourself a favor and avoid IBM. The culture is broken, the leadership is inept, and your work-life balance will suffer. There are far better tech companies out there where you can actually learn and grow your skills.

Every decision, no matter how minor, requires endless layers of approvals from people who have no real reason to be involved. This causes endless delays on very simple work, a complete lack of autonomy, and a company wide culture of inefficiency. New ideas are immediately shot down because the company is stuck in the past. We constantly lost talented people to better tech companies because they felt undervalued at IBM. 

Management is a joke. Leaders at IBM are out of touch with the day-to-day operations. Management does not help you grow or guide you to become a better employee. The company is led by people who have clearly forgotten what it means to actually lead – they are more focused on surviving layoffs than innovating or supporting their team members. 

At IBM career development is a joke. The company has no clear path for advancement. If you don't keep jumping around expect to be stuck in the same position for years, doing the same mind-numbing tasks with no hope of getting ahead.

Toxicity runs rampant at IBM. Expect to be constantly overworked and undervalued, with little to no recognition for the effort you put in. If your manager doesn't like you expect to be blocked from meetings and pertinent information until you eventually get laid off. Morale is at an all-time low, most people are looking to leave for another job/opportunity to escape.

In terms of compensation IBM is behind other tech companies. Forget about sign on bonuses, yearly bonuses or pay raises – they are non-existent, or at best, an afterthought. Some IBM orgs offer 2% - 3% pay raise yearly which is not enough to keep up with cost of living. 

Working at a tech company like IBM means you're stuck using outdated tech. The company’s focus is no longer on innovation, but on milking outdated products for as long as possible. Don’t expect to work on anything exciting or new. IBM can’t keep up with the tech landscape and as a result your skills and career will stagnate."

Digital sales transformation leader,3.0,"Oct 25, 2024","Former employee, more than 5 years","The legacy of great innovation still exists within small, siloed pockets of the large, albeit shrinking, company. Furthermore, IBM has a history of employing exceptionally smart and talented individuals. Finally, IBM has been hiring more young talent as a way to not only save money (less expensive staff) but also to build a new cadre of talented IBMers.","IBM, once a dominant force in the tech industry, has experienced a decline in its leadership position over the past few decades. While the company has invested heavily in emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing, its strategic decisions and organizational culture have contributed to its challenges.
IBM's revenue peaked in 2012 at $104.5 billion and has since declined to $61.86 billion in 2023.
IBM has a history of significant layoffs, often targeting experienced and high-performing employees. These layoffs can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and innovation, hindering the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions. In 2023 alone, IBM announced layoffs of around 3,900 employees, with plans for further cuts involving 8,000 roles by automating positions through AI. In 2024, thousands more senior skilled staff were laid off who were in the Band 10 (the highest pay grade before Executive pay bands) pay range in order to reduce expensive, talented employees in an effort to artificially boost the company's profits.
 IBM’s network and firmware are often outdated, with some software no longer supported by vendors. This reliance on aging tech infrastructure, compounded by offshoring, has made it harder for IBM to implement updates or compete effectively on cutting-edge services.
IBM’s commitment to AI and quantum computing, while substantial, has struggled to yield competitive financial returns, partly due to the company’s conservative approaches to AI applications, cost-focused layoffs, and reliance on outdated infrastructure.
Large amounts of technical debt and aging infrastructure prove difficult to connect shared data sources, leading to multiple ""sources of truth"" for data, which degrades the IBMer's ability to be efficient and highly productive.
Finally, while IBM was a pioneer in cloud computing, it was slow to adopt a cloud-first strategy, allowing competitors like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to gain significant market share."

Some employees may feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure.

Limited Work-Life Balance: In certain roles or during demanding projects, employees might find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long working hours and tight deadlines may contribute to this issue.

Bureaucracy: Large organizations often have established bureaucratic processes, which could lead to delays in decision-making and project execution. Navigating through these processes might be cumbersome for some employees.

Limited Managerial Support: Your experience of feeling overworked without sufficient support from management is a common concern in various workplaces. In a large company, communication channels can sometimes be complex, and individual experiences may differ based on teams and managers.

Emphasis on Metrics: Some employees may feel that the company places a strong emphasis on metrics and performance indicators, which could potentially impact the work environment and stress levels.

Limited Flexibility: Depending on the role and team, some employees might find that the company has a more structured and less flexible approach to work arrangements.

Communication Challenges: In a large organization, communication can sometimes be a challenge. Important information might not always be effectively communicated across teams, leading to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity."

Terrible place to work for engineers in general but female engineers specifically. Male colleagues make way more, are offered stock, and sign-on bonuses. When asking for the same, management tells you IBM does not do such things. Which is a complete lie. Spent 8 years working for this company only to find out these things later on and immediately deciding to leave. Worked towards a promotion for 3 years and only was told I should have gotten it 3 years prior when I decided to quit. Save yourself the time. They have no clear goals and are just headed down the drain. Their HR is completely messed up, basically non-existent. Worked there for 8 years and they asked for money back for ""overpayment"" or they would send me to collections. Am looking into a lawyer to deal with the discrimination and terrible behavior."

They really are walking the talk when it comes to how best to provide feedback in a fast-moving, social environment.  While the outside debate rages on about the value of performance management systems, IBM has done something about it, and has spent time listening to employees and incorporating their feedback into the design elements of the new system. No more forced distribution, with multiple touchpoints during the year and a human-scale time horizon around goal-setting and goal attainment.  All around, this is one of the best approaches to performance management that I've seen.",We'll wait to see how well managers can incorporate this.

It's a cold, cold place where the only measure of worth seems to be billable hours. No place for people like us who were paid out of overhead to develop managed services and offer them to the world.

For mature teams (support teams of stable offerings, who'd each in their field 10-25+ years) - forcing a ""low performer"" to meet a quota when there really was no differentiator, was too close to a lie for me.

Empowering Work Environment: IBM encourages a culture of autonomy and responsibility, where employees are empowered to make decisions, innovate, and push the boundaries of technology.
Working at IBM provides opportunities to contribute to high-impact projects, grow professionally, and be part of a dynamic global team.","1. Bureaucracy and Slow Decision-Making
Large Company Structure: As a massive, global organization with over 350,000 employees, IBM can sometimes suffer from slow decision-making processes and bureaucratic hurdles. It can take time to get approvals or push through initiatives, which may frustrate employees looking for agility and speed in their work.
Complex Organizational Layers: The multi-layered hierarchy may make it difficult to implement changes or navigate internal structures.
2. Frequent Restructuring and Layoffs
Ongoing Restructuring: IBM has undergone several rounds of restructuring and realignment in recent years to focus on cloud computing and AI. While this shift is strategic, it has led to frequent layoffs and uncertainty in certain divisions.
Job Security Concerns: Due to these periodic layoffs, employees may feel insecure about their positions, particularly in legacy business units like hardware or traditional IT services.
3. Compensation and Raises
Slow Salary Growth: Some employees report that salary increases and promotions can be slow to materialize, particularly when compared to competitors in the tech industry. Merit-based raises are sometimes modest, despite high performance.
Below-Average Pay in Some Regions: Depending on location and role, IBM's base salary may not always be competitive with other major tech companies, especially for junior or mid-level employees.
4. Work-Life Balance
Long Hours in Some Roles: While IBM does offer remote and flexible work options, some employees, particularly in client-facing or high-pressure roles, report long hours and heavy workloads. The balance between work and personal life can be challenging in certain departments.
Global Teams: Employees working with international teams may have to deal with time zone differences, leading to meetings or tasks outside of standard working hours.
5. Legacy Systems and Technology
Outdated Technology in Certain Areas: Despite its focus on innovation, IBM still has divisions dealing with older, legacy systems and technologies. Working on these systems may not be as exciting or fulfilling for employees looking to engage with cutting-edge projects.
Transition to Cloud: IBM is still in the process of pivoting to become a cloud-first company. Some teams are caught between maintaining legacy systems and transitioning to modern platforms, which can be difficult to navigate.
6. Pace of Innovation
Slow Adoption of New Technologies: In some cases, IBM's size and bureaucracy can slow down the adoption of newer technologies or agile practices, making it harder to keep up with fast-moving trends in the tech industry.
Resistance to Change: Legacy teams or more traditional areas of the company may resist newer, more modern methods of working, such as DevOps or agile practices, which can frustrate employees looking to innovate.
7. Limited Career Advancement
Limited Mobility in Certain Divisions: While IBM offers many training and learning opportunities, some employees report that career advancement can be slow, especially in non-technical or support roles.
Competition for Promotions: Due to the company's size, competition for leadership roles or promotions can be stiff, and upward mobility may be more challenging in saturated areas.
8. Complex Internal Tools and Processes
Complicated Internal Systems: Employees have reported that internal systems (such as HR tools, approval workflows, and internal communication platforms) can be outdated or overly complex, which can hamper productivity.
Inefficient Processes: Navigating IBM’s processes, from project management to performance evaluations, may feel inefficient, especially compared to more streamlined, agile environments in smaller companies.
9. Focus on Legacy Clients
Older Client Base: Some employees may find that much of the company's business still revolves around maintaining legacy clients or contracts, particularly in industries like finance, government, or healthcare. This focus may limit exposure to exciting, new industries or projects.
10. Cultural Divide Across Teams
Varied Experience Based on Department: The culture at IBM can vary significantly from one department or location to another. Employees in newer, cloud-focused divisions might have a more dynamic, innovative environment compared to those in traditional, more bureaucratic areas.
International Differences: Because IBM is a global company, employees may experience cultural and communication differences when collaborating with teams in different countries."

Both leaders realized that the top IT companies in the world had deep in investment in design and UX research. For 7 years or so, IBM was a wonderful place to work. I had a future and I had hope. I worked with great people.","But Ginni failed to increase revenue. 

Arvind Krishna was put in place, a mustachioed little man, Jack Welch's Indian 8th cousin on his mother's side, with a drive to increase revenue at all cost. He got the stock price to record levels. Yay. 

But Arvind has destroyed IBM's culture. The design program was laid waste. Phil Gilbert and even his successor was let go. Now the company is being managed by this visionless egomaniac who has staked IBM's entire future on a sad stack of AI solutions that previously he himself had left on a shelf as irrelevant. He has done all he can to make IBM a dividend stock anyone would want, and he didn't care how many IBmers he'd have to step over to get there. 

IBM is a truly awful place to work now. And the man lies as much as Donald Trump - pretending the endless layoffs he has instituted is to due to ""AI"" - when what that really means is ""All India"" as he relentlessly outsources and American jobs to his home county and lying that it is because of IBM's great AI tech.

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jul 9, 2024","Former employee, more than 3 years","Coworkers were *mostly* nice. Management was kind, if not always competent.
People that don't work at IBM and aren't in the tech industry think it's a prestigious company.","Several coworkers were just outright rude, hostile and almost insufferable to work with. They often seemed angry and bitter and I didn't want to turn into them.
Management seemed detached, disinterested in the job and basically already retired, zero advocacy for me as person or interest in my professional growth and development.
Good work always just brought heap loads more of the same drudgery. Innovation was rejected immediately, ""that's a great idea, and you're right, but IBM will never do that,"" was a common reply. 
Other teams and departments were hard to work with, often not responding in a timely manner and requiring constant hand holding and follow up to get anything done. I got the impression the organization was disintegrating and no one knew what they were doing or wanted to do it anymore.
Arvind was an impersonable jerk that doesn't care about his employees. 
Benefits were not good and getting worse every year.
Salary was bottom of the market and they always wanted me to work on holidays while all the execs were out. Thanksgiving and New Year's especially. 
They only paid agile lip service.
Their tools were the worst things I've ever used in my entire life. I'm sure they were once cutting edge, back in 1988.
Management could often not be reached and refused to commit to more than one or two stand ups a week. 
Often took at least a quarter to get anything done, and more often than it ever should did it take six months to one year. 
They just relentlessly pile work on you. It never ended. Was so glad when I got an offer at a smaller, faster company that paid top of the market and offered better benefits and am able to do more work in less time and on my own time table.
Most of their revenue growth appeared to be just accounting gimmicks. They're just sucking big blue dry of every last drop for their investors and then it'll die off.
Lots of that terrible fake inclusion stuff like having a taco day for Hispanic culture (I'm not even kidding).
Totally incapable of functioning as a remote company, of course they wanted everyone to go back to the office they literally couldn't operate any other way - management might have to actually do their job in a remote setting.
The company is the laughing stock of its peers. The WalMart of tech companies."

I watched directors harrass sales representatives, show favoritism and engage in retaliation and nothing was done about it."

1. They've stopped 401k matching (6%) and have switched to a ""Retirement benefit account"" that matches 5% of your salary.

Also because its an RBA and not a 401k you don't have the same protections and choice if something happens to IBM, at least with a 401k its your account, the RBA stays withing IBM's control until you leave

Spent over 3 years with the company and they provided me and others with no actual projects, just had us changing training topics every week or two, gaining surface level knowledge without any practical experience. All practical experience I gained was doing projects on my own time after work hours because I was simply told ""Learn X on Udemy"" This made it incredibly difficult to speak to ones abilities when finding a new job on top of the dread of opening my laptop every day. On top of walking back their remote work policy and having me go back to spending 2+ hours a day in traffic that I could instead be spending with my family. It never felt like a team environment with everyone stuck on Udemy with their headphones on anyway. Got calls regularly on weekend evenings (8-9 pm)to design and develop features that weren't urgent just because one of the architects didn't have anything else to do and wanted us to work on these features right away and not charge the client for those hours worked.

IBM is the only place I've ever worked where not delivering anything simply doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is creating the >>> appearance <<< of work, by organizing countless meetings and producing massive amounts of paperwork.

I used to love it. Now, for over six months, we're in some unofficial, ambiguous hiring freeze. There was some restructuring going on, and the budget for 2023 was supposed to be announced in February 2023. Then March 2023. It's April 2023 and there is STILL no budget for 2023. Meanwhile, IBM boasts 4,4% growth in revenue, and executives are sending out general e-mails demanding excellence. My team has been understaffed since Q4 2022, and there is ongoing employee turnover - things are expected to worsen. Grandious failure of executives to communicate anything about the budget and plans for 2023. I am unbelievably disappointed in IBM and its management. They pretend that all is well, have the ignorance to demand maximum performance from their employees, but ignore our daily reality. I will not work a minute overtime to compensate for their inability to manage until some form of official communication addresses my concerns. I do not recommend joining IBM at this point in time."

IBM hires many sub-ks or offshore employees for work which leaving employees struggling to find new projects
Teams are fairly silo'd so if you are interested in trying a new industry or role, it's nearly impossible to switch over. They do not like to hire across divisions or ""give people a chance"". Sometimes it seems like you are only doing roles where you have prior experience, so learning and growth can be challenging unless you find a manager willing to give you a new opportunity."

Strategy consultant,4.0,"Oct 12, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year","IBM is a great place to develop. The company plays across the entire tech industry, has a huge consulting arm, and does cutting edge research. It's a steady ship and doesn't tend to get rocked by larger macro events, so it has good job security. The people are great, and it's a very collaborative environment. There are opportunities to switch positions fairly regularly, and as such you can grow your career at IBM. Oh, and the work-life balance is pretty darn great.","The compensation and benefits are not in line with the rest of the tech industry. Promotions are relatively slow, but at regular intervals. Over and above performance is not rewarded below the executive level. So, if you bust your butt more than your coworker, you'll likely still get promoted at the same time.

The Google ""IBM Commissions lawsuits"" for round two. In 30 years in sales, I have never had a company try to screw me out of a very large commission the week after a deal signed. They claimed there had been an administrative error and cancelled my incentive letter, issuing a new one for me to sign that would have cut my commission in half. There was no mistake. I knew the compensation plan my colleagues were on and it was the same as mine. Managers who I thought were friends were spineless and went along with this farce. When I sought legal representation, I was surprised to learn how common this practice was. IBM has a culture that promotes technocrats, not leaders.

Until you find one, just soak all the knowledge that you can, it's offered to you and encouraged. While you are ""on the bench"" (not on a project) and most projects, everyone is extremely flexible. Everyone has a life outside of work and mostly everyone knows that. I think this is a fantastic environment and place to work. I'm proud to be an IBMer.","I can't really think of one. However, I do want to talk about 1 con that I have seen a lot. IBM does require on some projects that you work 45 hours week. There is a reason for this. Remember all of that free education you received, that certification you didn't pay for that will follow you anywhere you go, the paychecks you received during this, when all you have done at this point is cost the company money? This is where you make up for it. Now that you are generating income for IBM, that extra hour a day is your repayment. 1000% Worth it if you ask me.

Is this a pro? Of course not, but glassdoor forces you put something down as a Pro.","Lots of incompetent managers. Management does no real work. They just cook up bad ideas about things they know nothing about. Then makes their team implement their bad ideas. Management is getting rid a lot of US workers and moving these jobs to other countries like India and Mexico to save a buck, while holding on to their own jobs. They threatened their employees to get a vaccine or stop working. They made a vaccine policy based on Joe Biden's unconstitutional mandate. They likely did this due to further reduce employees numbers in the US. IBM lost employees without finding replacements for them. The work gets passed to current employees, and IBM refused to compensate employees for taking on additional work duties. IBM made employees take Diversity & Inclusion training similar to Coca-Cola's training that educated employees ""To Be Less White"" I seen IBM's first hand practices of hiring large amounts of young employees. They called it Vitality Hiring. After the new younger employees got their training from older, more seasoned workers, IBM would have massive amounts of layoffs. Of course, the older higher paid employees get laid off, while the new young employees were safe from the layoff. IBM is a disgraceful company, don't be fooled by their fake reputation of being a honorable company. They are far from it."

While that can be a highly rewarding and build a lot of your professional growth, it also limits the bandwidth I have to dedicate to internal IBM initiatives.

I was a remote employee who never set foot in an IBM office ever, and I have a valid medical exemption. I submitted my medical exemption to comply with their new policy, and they rejected it saying they needed more “proof”. So my doctor of over 15 years wrote out a lengthy explanation of why I’m unable to receive any vaccines & provided his contact info so they could investigate further if they would like, but they still rejected it & put me on notice that I would be terminated if I did not provide proof of Covid vaccine. I tried to talk to someone in HR to try to get an actual human to look at this situation objectively & do the right thing, but I was literally refused any actual human contact with HR. I was only able to email the generic HR inbox & id get a reply from a different person every time. Couldn’t even reply directly to the HR rep that would message back. Could only “reply” to the generic HR email. How is a corporate company who has never had any actual human contact with me allowed to override the medical expertise of a doctor who has treated me for fifteen years?! SHAMEFUL!!"

In my region IBM had had multiple projects cancelled due to poor performance due to understaffing.

I only thank this company for the opportunity to make a decent salary. It helped me a lot.,"Reflecting on my tenure at IBM in 2023 compels me to share the profound challenges that markedly influenced my professional journey. My aim is not to disparage but to candidly outline my experiences, hoping that it might spur constructive dialogue and foster a more favorable environment for future employees.

The work culture I encountered was, regrettably, far from what I had envisioned for a company of IBM's repute. It was a culture that seemed to undervalue diversity and inclusivity, not merely in terms of initiatives but in the fundamental respect for the varied perspectives that each team member brings. This disregard for diversity was a precursor to a broader issue—a palpable lack of collaboration, where projects often succumbed to personal egos rather than converging towards mutual success.

Compounding these issues was the absence of support and mentorship from my direct supervisor. Guidance, encouragement, and constructive feedback are pivotal for any professional's growth, yet these were conspicuously missing. The absence of direction not only hampered my development but also left me feeling isolated within a team, struggling to navigate through the professional challenges without a mentor.

The general lack of support extended across the organization, with human resources seemingly indifferent to the employees' grievances. This lack of engagement from HR further solidified the sense of neglect, making it incredibly challenging to see a pathway for growth or resolution of issues within the company.

Management and HR's inaction towards fostering a supportive and collaborative environment made my experience at IBM in 2023 the most disheartening chapter of my career in the United States. It was a culture steeped in self-interest, overshadowing the collective well-being and the innovative spirit that IBM has historically been known for.

Sharing this experience is not about dwelling on the past but about emphasizing the critical need for a supportive work environment. It underscores the importance of mentorship, respect for diversity, and collaborative spirit—essential for personal growth and organizational success. I hope bringing these issues to light encourages IBM and similar organizations to re-evaluate their culture, ensuring a more inclusive, supportive, and growth-oriented environment for all employees."

This practice not only contributes to client satisfaction and fleeting moments of joy but can occasionally lead to an excess of humor within the company, creating a slightly peculiar atmosphere. However, it is apparent that this is an effort to convey friendliness and openness.","as one delves deeper, it becomes apparent that the higher echelons of management lack experience beyond the company. Their trajectory has been confined within the organization, resulting in promotions to high executive positions without acquiring the market-level skill sets essential for the company's size and type.

Challenges in Career Advancement:

In the initial stages, when the company was smaller, promotions occurred at a rapid pace—four times a year—with minimal criteria. However, with the company's expansion, the influx of experienced professionals working under the old employees, many of whom received higher titles than their skills warranted, has shifted the promotion landscape, making advancements more challenging. with opaque promotion criteria. Individuals in client-facing roles, where client feedback plays a pivotal role in promotions, are typically occupied by long-term employees and mostly who hold high titles, giving them a distinct advantage. This creates a disparity, with dedicated engineers contributing significantly to the actual work, facing challenges in securing promotions. Furthermore, the feedback loop from leaders crucial for promotions seems biased, as leaders are often reluctant to acknowledge those who may outshine them. The emphasis on client feedback, which holds way more value than the leader's evaluation, adds an additional layer of complexity.

Issues in Project Execution:

In the realm of project execution, the initial phase involves selecting the right people for leadership roles for each project. However, if the top leadership lacks the necessary technical skills, they struggle to identify and hire the right leaders for the project. Often, leaders are chosen based on familiarity, connections, or charm, resulting in projects led by individuals with less expertise than their team members. This situation leads to delivering subpar products, attributed to poorly structured projects and demotivated engineers aware that only leaders receive promotions.

Now, I routinely assess an individual's entry date into the company to discern their genuine skill level when interacting with them. However, I've heard that in the past, the company had exceptionally skilled engineers who have since departed—there might still be a few that I have not encountered yet (old team).

Dubious Policies:

The company is inundated with policies, with new ones emerging regularly alongside numerous committees. While having clear policies is beneficial, there is a concern that some are misleading or subject to frequent changes. For instance, the evolution of policies such as ""Responsible PTO"" raises concerns about inconsistency and limitations on employee benefits. The introduction of new policies without clear communication adds to the confusion. Policies that once offered unlimited PTO have transformed into enforced maximums with potential rejections and unpaid leaves.

Employee Challenges:

Noteworthy among the policies is one that heightens job insecurity: termination in two months if the company fails to secure a project for an employee. This creates anxiety among employees, pressuring them to accept engagements regardless of personal preferences or suitability. The consequence is an exodus of experts and experienced professionals seeking stability elsewhere, leaving behind those who couldn't find alternative employment.

In conclusion, there is a disparity between the company's external charm and its internal challenges. Addressing issues related to leadership skills, promotion criteria, and policy consistency is crucial for the organization's long-term health and sustained success. The company's practice of conducting surveys and seeking feedback should be complemented by a genuine commitment to addressing the identified issues."

WFH, 401K w/ 6% match, 3 weeks vacation + 4 personal holidays + 7 days sick time, marriage leave (1 week), maternal/ paternal leave (3 months), miscarriage leave (up to 4 weeks in per year), and many other EAP benefits. IBM is ahead of the game. 3. Diversity and Inclusion are central to the organization, you can find a place at IBM where your culture/ identity is supported and uplifted. ERGs actually host engaging events. 4. Mentorship opportunities are what you make of it! (pro & can be a con) 5. Grow your curiosity with endless training opportunities and certifications!","Big company, if you are not actively building your network and making a deliberate effort to connect with others virtually it is easy to get overlooked. Some leaders you encounter still have old school mentality... you are not a good consultant unless you are putting in 70+ hours building decks/ relationships/ pulling together research. We have lives, families, and hobbies outside of work and it is okay to have busy weeks but busy months and busy years are not sustainable. If you encounter one, be patient, work hard, and move onto the next project. Not all leaders work like this, find another that fits your way of working."

It is nothing more than that. My advice? Leave! Your quality of life and career will improve, drastically. Just ask anyone that took the leap they'll all tell you the very same thing. There are still entire teams that even when on site, work at great distances from each other across vastly different time zones; they are not working together even when in an office - it's a ruse. Those of us that built what used to be idolized as the great IBM of old, is long gone. We built IBM's reputation - not the recent leadership (if you can even confer that on them). Also long gone and buried with Old Man Watson (9-edge, face down as they say) is the company's original mantra - ""Respect for the Individual"" and ""Think"" there is no respect anymore - and these greedy executives don't and can't think; employment is purely transactional and employees became faceless widgets long ago. Current employees are paid just enough but have been loaded with FUD - too scared to leave and ridden by first-line managers that only carry out orders from above after getting their spine-ectomies. Those with skills and value can do far better elsewhere and avoid getting stomach ulcers from living under constant anxiety. The new generation and top talent demand remote work options. My advice to you is this: take a clue - exclude Big Blue from your short list of best places to work, unless you want to work under constant FUD. Don't walk away - run!"

This is good if all you care about is technology but prevents application teams delivering business value and can turn a growing business offering into one that is stalled. When layoffs occur, those selected are rarely chosen based on poor performance. Instead it's typical for a entire location to be shutdown and then the work offshored to a cheaper geo.

Employee pay is frequently sub-par compared to similar roles in competing companies. Executive pay is far too high.

Automation engineer,1.0,"Dec 27, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year","I'm sorry, but really none at all","I was hired for my second job after working with Python at a previous company. I had just completed the Austin Community College courses in Python and Java.

As soon as I was hired, I was sat at a desk and told to manually test a website. I asked for github access and was denied, even read-access. I asked the PMs to include me in scrums and assign me tickets, the PM never talked to me. Every time I would go to his desk, he would say he was busy, every single time. I had no idea what features the devs were working on. When I tried to ask devs directly, my boss would say I was 'bothering' them. I was told not to talk to the devs ever. I was told I was hired for my 'customer service' abilities and shouldn't expect to code. My boss hadn't added me to any jira boards or introduced me to a single person in development. I brought up to my boss how I was expecting an engineering org to work with QA- that I would be involved in scrum ceremonies where work was ticketed, assigned to a developer, and then tasks assigned to QA for either manual or automation. I was told by my boss to instead just keep testing the same UI over and over ""like driving a car up and down the road, then left and right, then diagnonal"". I was baffled. I also mentioned that I was hired as an automation engineer and my boss told me ""not to worry about that"".

A few months in, the company announced that they were switching to a python test automation project, which is something I had recent experience in. When I asked to work on that, I was told I didn't have a Computer Science degree and didn't have engineering experience, so I was denied.

I tried to bypass management at this point and talk to the engineers on that time. At one point I told someone I was sleeping 4 hours a day because I was required to be in both the 5:15AM standup and the 11:15PM standup by my boss. This standup included a bunch of people in India that I had no idea what relation they had to me and seemed to be working on a different project. I just knew I was mandated to be on the call. I was also taking 9 hours of college credit to prove I was ""good enough"" to code, even though I did have an MIS degree and several years of experience when they hired me. IBM was clear that they only counted Computer Science degrees so I was taking classes that would qualify me for that degree. The person I was talking to about my sleep issues told me 4 hours of sleep is too many, I should only sleep 2 hours a day. I should also mention that IBM's campus was pretty far from where I lived and having to attend both a late night and early morning standup was wearing on me so much that I rented out my condo at a loss of $100 a month to a friend and then got a studio apartment near IBM for the year. During this time period, I had to switch my internet but needed to secure the apartment before AT&T would switch my line over. Once I got the keys to the apartment, I requested to move my internet and was told it would take about 10 business days. My boss told me I needed to get internet 9 days earlier or I'd be fired, even though I'd already escalated the request and was given the earliest date. Keep in mind, I was ONLY moving because of IBM's standups. Not having internet for 9 days would be added to my PIP.

Six months in, I was also told there was a issue in the code bubbling up from customer service. When two people pressed a button in the UI at the same time, there was an API error. I was told that I was directly responsible for fixing this issue. I asked how I could be responsible for a race condition when not only was I not the developer, but I wasn't even given github access and able to see the repo that was causing the issue. I was put on a PIP.

I quit this job the morning and hour I was hired a year later. I was unable to quit earlier because I took a signing bonus that I couldn't afford to pay back before then. I was in a lot of medical debt when I took the job. 

The nature of the work also made it very hard to get another job. I had no idea how to present what I was doing in interviews. Eventually to interview better, I started a github project using my own name and started automating the public facing website. This project never integrated with IBM as a company and was never was looked at by a single person except me, but it was the only experience I was able to get at this job doing the thing they supposedly hired me for.

Also, the benefits are awful. Due to a chronic illness, i usually max out my insurance. IBM's max was 15k so I incurred 15k in medical expenses the year I worked for IBM on top of my previous medical debt."

Application developer,1.0,"Dec 28, 2023","Former employee, less than 1 year","If you are good at sales and/or self-promotion, you might be able to make it at IBM.","I came on board as part of an acquisition. After an initial period of ""this is going to be great!"", it quickly became obvious that IBM had no clue what to do with our people or customers. One by one customers left and people were put on the bench. 

1. At IBM, you are basically on your own for finding work. Perhaps if you come into IBM and work your way up, you can build a network, but coming in through an acquisition, you are basically ignored. 

2. Folks at IBM are constantly begging (and yes, that's an appropriate term) for work, since there's little effort made to make sure people are staffed on projects. Even new hires often go onto the internal Slack groups begging for work before they're put on a PIP and shown the door.

3. There is no recognition of technical skills that I could see--it appeared the only way to get ahead was to get co-workers to write glowing reviews about you. If you worked for an external customer, you were expected to solicit reviews of your work. There is no way to simply do excellent technical work and be recognized without shameless self-promotion.

4. IBM prefers to staff technical resources from cheap overseas labor, so if you're like we were (well-compensated and based in North America), you're out of luck--you're too expensive for anybody to touch you.

5. HR is understaffed, to the point that when I resigned, my resignation got ""lost"" and I continued to get paid. Now I have to go through a mess to return money. It says something about a company when they have an entire elaborate website just for correcting overpayments to employees--there are obviously a lot of mistakes made."

Software engineer,5.0,"Aug 13, 2023","Current employee, more than 8 years","Global Presence and Impact: IBM is a multinational technology company with a vast global presence. Working for IBM can provide you with opportunities to work on projects that have a significant impact on various industries worldwide. Cutting-Edge Technology: IBM has a long history of innovation and research in technology. As a software engineer, you might have the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies, participate in research, and contribute to the development of advanced solutions. Career Growth and Learning: IBM offers various training and development programs for its employees. You'll likely have access to resources for continuous learning, skill enhancement, and opportunities to grow within the company. Diverse Projects and Roles: IBM operates across a wide range of industries, from cloud computing and artificial intelligence to data analytics and cybersecurity. This diversity can provide software engineers with the chance to work on different types of projects and explore various roles. Work-Life Balance: IBM, like many established tech companies, often places emphasis on maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The company might offer flexible working arrangements and support initiatives that prioritize employee well-being.","Bureaucracy and Size: Due to its size and complexity, IBM can sometimes be perceived as having layers of bureaucracy. Decision-making processes might be slower and more convoluted in a large organization. Job Security: Like many corporations, IBM has undergone periods of restructuring and layoffs. Job security can be a concern, especially during challenging economic times or shifts in the company's strategic direction. Innovation Pace: While IBM is known for its history of innovation, some critics argue that the company has faced challenges in keeping up with the fast-paced changes in the tech industry compared to newer, more agile startups. Hierarchy and Advancement: Advancement within a large organization like IBM might require navigating a hierarchical structure. Progression might not always be solely based on merit, and some employees might find it challenging to move up the corporate ladder. Workload and Pressure: Depending on the specific role and project, software engineers at IBM might face high workloads and tight deadlines. Balancing the demands of the job with personal life can be challenging at times"

Or maybe do come and fight the good fight here with those of us trying to change the company by being vocal. Any rebels out there come join this century old company and shake things up. It sure needs it. :-)","IBM is forcing their employees to return to the office while also lying about having actual data to back up their reasons for this decision. IBMers have made it very clear to upper management they want their flexibility to chose how they work, not to be told how to work. The numbers IBM does have, but is denying they exist, is how during the pandemic when everyone was working remotely we produced the most amount of revenue the company has seen in years. Interesting IBM is choosing to omit that. I am not saying for the folks out there that like coming into the office that they should be remote too. No, I am saying IBMers want the freedom of choice to decide which works best for them. Not ""mandating"" us to do exactly what upper management wants. It really is despicable. What is worse, if this company would get its act together, the people who are not in upper management are lovely people and the best co-workers (I guess I do have a pro there).

These are the main point of views that are headaches: - Nothing is centralized, teams around IBM use different tools and processes, is like an anarchy. - Management is not transparent at all (I had the luck to have a manager who was really good, but the others I have... lies and smoke). - If you are in the Research department, probably this doesn't apply, but there are a lof of people hired who doesn't know anything about Agile methodologies, pipelines, DevOps... I have been working with teams that everything was manual. They didn't have anything automated, no version control, no documentation for people once they start in the team, just people ""developing"" without asking themselves ""why I am doing this"" or ""what can I improve"". They don't care about quality or documentation, and this was not a new team. - The CEO use to have some monthly sessions where he explains and answer questions that people ask. Don't let them lay to you, most of the things are lies. The most funny is he answered questions like ""There will be layoffs in IBM?"", he said ""we are not going to do layoffs in the following months"". Well, more than 19.000 were laid off two weeks after. - They bury you in paper and bureaucracy. Once you leave the company expect to receive 100 mails with papers. I recommend to hire a lawyer, because these guys retire the money from your 401k when they shouldn't, and when you reclaim they said you were right, but you have to notice it. Whatever, there are a lot of things that can be improved in IBM. I feel sad that a company like this, that was amazing before, now is like this. Recommendation: if you have other offers, take a look to the Glassdoor reviews (of course), but try to avoid this company. If you plan to retire here, I guess is a good company to do it, but if you plan to learn more and grow, forget about it."

Senior software engineer,1.0,"Aug 13, 2023","Former employee, more than 8 years","Some days you can't get any work done because you're too busy helping others or supporting customers, and that is not punished. Insurance is decent if you spend the extra for the PPO plan. And don't add anyone but yourself to the plan. Never had a problem with remote working. While people near the office were forced back in against their will I was lucky enough to not be anywhere near any offices, so luckily was exempt from this farce of a policy. Understanding of personal and family issues that can arise unexpectedly, and PTO given for everyone often enough to feel like an actual reward. Lots of really good people to work with, as long as they aren't in management.","Oh boy. Pay is abysmal. My new job literally doubled my salary for the exact same job with much less responsibility and much better work/life balance. Management is inept at best, and maliciously incompetent at worst. Skeleton crews are common. Any project that requires 6-8 people to maintain normally will have three people at best, or just one (such as my case). A fetish for having contractors build things and FTEs maintain it afterward, which is literally the worst way to build software, especially when deadlines mean code reviews get tossed in order to deliver on time. Realistic deadlines get scoffed at. Sure Bob, one person can perform major version changes to several systems in a single two week sprint, while also doing support duty and 24/7 on-call for multiple teams around the world. All my coworkers felt ""captive"", and constantly looking for a better job. Sure doesn't help to build teamwork. Upper management is literally leeches patting themselves on the back and giving each other bonuses, even when their department utterly fails at every task. As long as they reduce headcount, they've won. Actual goals are irrelevant. Behind the curve on literally everything technology wise. Do not expect innovation to be rewarded. Sets the standard for ""failing upward"". Promotions are reserved specifically for those who are too incompetent to do their current job, so they can rain incompetence down upon their peers from above. Catering to anti-vaccine idiots. There was a small but loud uproar over vaccine policy, and IBM literally enabled that small but loud group to drown out all discourse with conspiracy theories and easily debunked lies. Luckily the most malicious of them were let go after they got too abusive over work chat, but all of those conspiracy theories should've been shot down as soon as they were reported."

A CIC is an onshore cost center, so they expect you to work same projects as the core consulting practices, but they want to pay you half the salary. You'll be compensated peanuts compared to others doing the exact same job. The only instance that I would recommend the CIC is if you're absolutely desperate for a decent job. Just remember that you'll start off with an unfair salary, you won't get meaningful raises, and promotions are pretty much out of the question despite high performance. Overall, definitely do not overstay at a CIC. In this situation, you should only work for a year to get the experience and move on to another company that will actually value you."

As someone who has been with the company for 12 years, you are well-positioned to speak to the many positives of working for IBM. Here are some potential pros that you could highlight: Opportunities for Growth: IBM is a massive company with a diverse range of business units and functions. This means that there are numerous opportunities for employees to grow their careers, both vertically and horizontally. You yourself have been able to do so, which is a testament to the company's commitment to developing its talent. Access to Cutting-Edge Technology: As a technology company, IBM is at the forefront of many emerging trends and innovations. This means that employees have the opportunity to work with some of the most advanced technology available, which can be both intellectually stimulating and career-enhancing. Competitive Compensation and Benefits: IBM is known for offering its employees competitive compensation and benefits packages. This can include things like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Additionally, the company may offer perks like flexible work arrangements, employee discounts, and tuition reimbursement. Company Culture: IBM places a strong emphasis on values such as diversity, inclusion, and sustainability. This can be appealing to employees who want to work for a company that aligns with their personal values. Additionally, the company fosters a collaborative and team-oriented culture, which can be both supportive and motivating. Global Reach: IBM is a truly global company, with operations in more than 170 countries. This means that employees have the opportunity to work with colleagues from around the world, gaining exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking. Additionally, the company's global reach can provide employees with opportunities to work on projects with international scope and impact. Overall, working for IBM can be a highly rewarding experience, with opportunities for growth, access to cutting-edge technology, competitive compensation and benefits, a strong company culture, and global reach. As someone who has been with the company for over a decade, you are a testament to the many positives of working for IBM.","It's important to recognize that while working for IBM can offer numerous advantages, there may also be some potential drawbacks or challenges. Based on your experience, here are some cons that you could mention: Poor Management: Unfortunately, not all managers are created equal, and some may not be effective at their jobs. As you mentioned, you've worked under 17 managers in your time at IBM, and some of them may have been problematic. This can be especially frustrating if a manager doesn't like you personally, as it can impact your professional growth and advancement. Pressure to Conform: You also mentioned that there can be pressure to be a ""yes man"" and conform to management's expectations. This can be a challenge for employees who want to think independently or challenge the status quo. If the company culture is overly rigid or hierarchical, it can be difficult to thrive if you don't fit into the mold that's expected of you. Performance Expectations: Like many companies, IBM likely has performance expectations that employees are expected to meet. However, if the bar is set too high or the metrics used to evaluate performance are flawed, it can be demotivating or discouraging for employees who are trying to do their best. Large Company Dynamics: IBM is a massive company with many moving parts, which can make it difficult for employees to navigate or feel like they're making an impact. If you're working on a large team or project, it can be easy to feel like a small cog in a big machine. Changing Industry Landscape: As a technology company, IBM is operating in a rapidly-changing industry that can be difficult to keep up with. If the company is slow to adapt to new trends or technologies, it can be frustrating for employees who want to stay on the cutting edge. Overall, while there are certainly benefits to working for IBM, there may also be some challenges or drawbacks to consider. These can include poor management, pressure to conform, high performance expectations, the dynamics of a large company, and a changing industry landscape."

Software developer,1.0,"Jul 19, 2023","Former employee, more than 1 year",Initially great promises but it ended in chaos,"As much as I'd like to reminisce about the good times I had at my job, it is essential to provide an honest and candid review for the benefit of others seeking employment opportunities from IBM. My time at this company was quite tumultuous and eventually ended on a sour note. The company initially showed great promise, and I was genuinely excited about the work and the potential for growth. However, as time went on, it became evident that there were deep-rooted issues with the company's leadership. There was a lack of clear direction, poor communication, and a noticeable disconnection between management and the rest of the employees. One major downfall was the company's decision to undergo a restructuring process. While reorganizations can sometimes lead to positive changes, in this case, it only resulted in chaos and confusion. Key roles were eliminated, leading to a considerable loss of talent and expertise. This had a severe impact on the team's productivity and morale. The handling of the restructuring process was unprofessional and lacked transparency. Thousands of employees, including myself, were laid off without any prior warning or proper support during the transition. This abrupt termination left a lasting negative impact on my professional and personal life. They didn’t even give any of us an exit survey when we left. Moreover, the hazardous issues with leadership were not just limited to their decisions during the restructuring. There were instances of favoritism, unequal treatment, and a failure to address concerns raised by employees. The toxic work environment created an atmosphere of fear and distrust, hindering collaboration and creativity. Overall, I cannot in good conscience recommend this company to anyone seeking employment. The combination of the poorly executed restructuring process and the hazardous leadership made for a detrimental work experience along with horrible pay and benefits compared to industry standards. I hope that the company will learn from its mistakes and improve, but I would advise potential employees to approach with caution."

Senior technical staff member,4.0,"Dec 15, 2022","Current employee, more than 1 year","IBM has always had a reputation for attracting and hiring the best. That is evident in all interactions with your peers. They are smart, helpful, and care about solving the problems, more than getting accolades. IBM provides lots of tools for bettering your career and yourself. It has as much of a ""Small Family Company"" feel as is possible, with the local management empowerment, despite its size. Another benefit is that IBM really rewards performance, not pedigree. IBM advances it's employees to titles, roles, and responsibilities commensurate with their abilities, and has similarly limited others with better credentials. Most accept and celebrate this, not begrudge it.","It is a big corporation.. there are global corporate policies (hoops to jump through) from everything from software procurement to annual appraisal, but overall, they are reasonable."

Security engineer,2.0,"Mar 23, 2023",Former employee,Working From Home and not a hassle to take vacation time.,"Non existent managers, shady business practices, no growth, micromanaging, lying to customers. IBM OFTEN had non USA employees working on client accounts that per their contracts stated they only wanted USA based employees to work on. IBM also took the CHEAP route and at least for my team, stopped hiring USA workers. When I was there, I was the LAST USA worker to be hired, for years after my manager only hired NON USA workers when the need was for USA workers based on the client contracts. In the YEARS I worked there in the office, I NEVER saw or met my manager, only heard his voice on the phone. He never visited our office and was out of touch with the realities of what we dealt with. In addition, the workload became so much and the micromanaging so bad that within a year, at least 5 people left our team. Also, the company employs derailing tactics. One of my team members applied to another job within the company, it was going well and he landed the job. Our manager talked to that position's manager and ended up getting my team member removed from moving into that position. Our manager then lied to this team member telling him he would give him a promotion and a raise...yes he got the promotion in title only which included the workload, but NOT the raise in pay. I honestly don't know how IBM (at least the security side) still functions, maybe because of their name and history? It definitely can't be from the terrible time I and many others experienced."

Talent acquisition partner,5.0,"Jan 17, 2023","Current employee, more than 1 year","Now I come from an agency environment, so it wouldn't be too difficult to beat my prior working experience. That being said, I am consistently impressed with IBM for the following reasons: 1. Autonomy: IBM managers do not hover over you and micromanage your performance. We instead depend on a lot of internal tools to get and give feedback on performance. Communication with our clients and managers is largely left up to us (with guidance), and the feedback from our managers is what is tantamount in our reviews. 2. Work load balance: gone are the days where I have too many reqs to handle. And because I'm assigned to a particular skill set within a business unit, I am able to hone in on my talent pool and also dig in deep to a skill set to get to know. I'm also able to move around, so the skill sets I am exposed to gets broader and deeper the longer I'm here. 3. Education access: IBMers tend to stick around because of the ability to learn entirely new skills through the robust and large internal education program. If your dream is to do something other than your job down the road, there's plenty of opportunity to learn brand-new skills--even learning to code! It's really up to you as an individual to choose your path within IBM.","1. The lack of bonuses year over year is a killer when trying to recruit candidates from outside IBM. Even with our best year yet for our shareholders, we will not be seeing competitive bonus incentives. 2. Return to office push: can we please just give up on this? I understand that it is a huge change due to real estate that is owned, but employee retention and satisfaction is much higher when we allow folks to work from home. The pressure to return to office is also much higher on the softer (""easier to replace"") skill sets, so this pressure is leveraged against your lower banded positions, where higher banded and more niche skills get much more leeway. 3. Compensation ratings for some cities are just wrong. Austin should not be at a ""national"" market level, given our rising cost of living pushing many employees out of the city center. Although leadership may be paid to live in the city center, your professional banded positions are not paying enough to be able to live close to the office, or to purchase property within the city."

Ux designer,4.0,"Jan 16, 2023",Current employee,"People: My team is mind-bogglingly nice and accepting. Your teammates will accept you, encourage you, and teach you to help you get to where you need to be. (Note this varies from team-to-team, but in general the design studio is filled with very nice people) Work-life balance: You will not be assigned more than 40 hours of work a week. It won't even come close, usually. Last year we had a roadmap that was supposed to be ""substantial work"" and my team finished the entire year in four months. Remote work: I've been able to work from anywhere in the world. Paris, Korea, Canada, and all over the US. Countries are coming out with ""Digital nomad"" visas, where you can extend your stay for a few years, and if you've ever wanted to live abroad while on an American salary, IBM might be the best company to let you to do so. Agency: you'll be trusted with pretty important stuff, and it's not uncommon for one designer to be in charge of an entire product. There are a lot of them at IBM. If you are a really good designer, you'll get a few chances to shine. Stability: I can't imagine anyone at IBM getting laid off, even after our last round of layoffs when the new CEO stepped in and wanted to make a big splash (had nothing to do with the company's performance), and even in this economy where every other tech company is doing layoffs.","Low compensation: below market, with shoddy-to-no benefits. However, given the amount of work you have to do I honestly think the pay is fair. Company brand / image: most companies understand that IBM requires a low amount of work and will put a discount on your years of experience. I've seen a few good designers move to other companies and get down-leveled. They're good designers though, so they get promoted back up pretty fast. Low chance of product success: Again, there are a lot of products at IBM. The strategy is kind of to have a small hand in every area of the market, and that means that a lot of the experiments will fail. Many products require heavy investment, but IBM doesn't like taking risks. Of course, that means they're a very steady company, and in this economy maybe that's also a good thing. Low volume of work: For designers, this means it'll be tough to find good feature work / things in general to write case studies on. When it comes to in-house design work a lot of things will already start to blend together, but when you don't have a lot of things to do to begin with... it's tough. If you end up at IBM early-career my advice is don't cruise, take initiative."

Indeed my management chain requires me to lie to my team:  people I trust and respect.  Lies and  misrepresentation are the IBM family values, particularly for personnel issues and also for business metrics.  That is the biggest downside - you never know when you're getting the straight story.  For example, the PBC system is a ranking system.  A first line manager is told what their ""skew"" has to be - the company advertises that a first line manager can use their own judgment for differentiation between team members, subject to some oversight to ensure equity.  In actual fact managers are told what to do and are required to lie to their team members so that the executives can make their metrics.

It was employee focused, there was a focus on the ""IBM family"" and my colleagues were truly like members of my family. Early in my career, when there were true leaders, there were plenty career growth opportunities. Leadership even approached you with new and challenging opportunities. In addition, there were true advocates and sponsors, supporting you and your development. With programs being cut (Corporate Service Corps, US Open, NY Rangers, Yankees ticket promotions, BlueThanks recognition gifts), benefits were reduced to almost nothing (401K match dropped from 6% to 5%) and you had to count your blessings if you survived the last rounds of RAs (which they still do regardless of what the CEO says in the press).","Hostile reorganization missions are used to end people's careers. For example, if you weren't part of the Marketing & Communications click, you were never accepted as part of the team. I was part of the MCC for two years and never felt welcome. I had an interim manager who was my peer on a Friday and became my ""acting manager"" on a Monday. Her main goal was to find ways I wasn't meeting job role standards, even making up value adds that were never discussed or part of agreed-upon SOWs. I was gaslit for over four months and was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan, where I was NEVER going to meet management's expectations due to the demands for course correction nearly every day. An example of ""valuable feedback"" from my manager was that she reviewed the same sentence for over 30 minutes and asked nonsense questions, as she gaslit me in every conversation. If you wanted my ""seat, "" why weren't you transparent and let me find a different role? Instead, my leadership attacked and tortured me. I LOVED the Friday at 5 pm responses - in which three managers conspired to ensure I never met their milestones, generating hours of work over the weekend, in attempt to save my career. YES - I actually did the work while on the PIP. Looking back, I should have done nothing."

-The pay. I found out with 10+ years of experience I get paid 20K more than a college grad. I got a bonus last year ($1500) and none this year. Pay raise of 5% which wasn't bad as a general statistic but terrible when you look at my base pay. IBM is investing in college grads by trying to pay them more... news flash they leave anyway and then so do your Senior/Lead designers because you pay them an embarrassing amount. You blew your wad on the new shiny toy out of college that bailed 1 year later. Congrats.

-The back end devs are determined to kill the world of good design. We cannot make a wonderful experience and have it be implemented in a reasonable amount of time. By ""reasonable"" I mean small CSS changes take 2 months and CRITICAL features to help us even half way compete with competitors like AWS take a year. It's filled with old dinosaurs developers who think that they can design and we are just worthless people that wear skinny pants.

-Offering Management (OM) is mostly useless. I have met one or two that were amazing at their job, the rest cannot understand what their job actually is. They are not art directors and they are supposed to deliver to us the main goal of what the design is supposed to be based on actual market research.

The experience I had at IBM really launched my professional career, most of my experience before was in unrelated fields.","Over time, management becomes more ""metrics driven"" - which is to say, short sighted.  Oh how many things we did twice because they weren't realistic about the scope of the work, or how it fit strategically.  Perhaps that's because much of the ""boots on the ground"" management has no idea what their underlings do.  Also, those awards and bonuses seem pretty arbitrary when you look at the big picture, seems if your own management isn't strong, your dept will never get their share - no matter how hard they work.

I am allowed to wear my goth getup to the office, we had a coworker start gender transition and someone from HR held a meeting with us to go over how to support our coworker during their transition and avoid any awkward conversations. LOVE IT! - My bosses definitely ask for their bottom lines, but we are encouraged to keep a healthy mental state. My due dates have been pushed without argument if I was having a hard time with my depression. - Lots of vacation days, designated holidays, and sick leave. No overtime to PTO options for my position. Life and health insurance is run of the mill, retirement is nice and we have an option to discuss our retirement investments with a financial management team quarterly for FREE. Daycare assistance, adoption assistance, and wonderful education assistance. - There are documents available to show you just what you need to do for raises, bonuses, and promotions. There is a small amount left to discretion, but you will always have proof to argue your worth. You have the opportunity to switch jobs internally and move from location to location (over years, of course. Not months.) This company is full of opportunity and awesome folks.","- Time zones. You will work on flex time, working a certain amount of hours a week, with whoever you are assigned to work with. Some mornings you will have meetings with offshore teams at 3am, and sometimes you will coordinate deployments at midnight on a Friday. There is usually ample warning, and these terms are kinda negotiable. I have gotten used to quick naps when needed. - Onboarding feels a little silly and lonely. You will be given a LOT of information and then left ALONE for 2 months while you slowly undergo endless onboarding training in addition to your position. I asked for a lot of help, and only got a little. I now mentor folks to try and help alleviate that, but it's rough across most cases."

They will move you around within the company until you find a spot that suits you. They also provide quite good health and retirement plans. There is immanent room for growth and promotion. It is possible to spend an entire life climbing the IBM corporate ladder (and some people obviously do). Additionally, IBM has one of the best learning/training programs I have ever come across. Top industry professionals develop what essentially amount to college-level courses. These courses (available on an enormous range of topics) are available to all employees (though some do require management approval). A self-motivated individual would undoubtedly find IBM to be one of the best places to learn and grow.","The company is very career-centric. This a con because everybody is old. Because IBM is so good at retaining it's employees, departments seem to become very top-heavy (lots of senior employees but relatively few junior employees). This ""oldness"" is especially apparent within the software group where management seems to be clinging to old-school development practices. Do NOT expect a modern culture like at Google. As a dev we have zero perks. There is no free coffee. The walls are barren. There is no food in the building. The entire experience feels sterile and dated."

That's the main reason I've stayed for over a year after being hired as an intern. I have gotten some great projects and exposure right out of college. There's also an insane amount of free internal learning and it is highly encouraged and mandatory in some cases to learn new things on the job. Work-life balance is great. I can work from home many days. The benefits are excellent. I have amazing doctors and the actual insurance companies offer many extra resources to IBM employees. 401k matching is also very ideal, I've saved quite a bit in a very short amount of time. There are also other nice perks like being a preferred employer at apartment complexes where I lived. Overall, you're covered if you're at IBM and in truth, they prepare you for a career in- or outside of the company. All of their certifications are transferable skills.","I still don't have an official title since my projects are all over the place. Unfortunately as an intern hire, I didn't have the flexibility to negotiate my salary or have a say in what position I wanted to be in. As a result, I am extremely underpaid. Also, I was placed in a team full of managers as entry-level, so that means I didn't have the chance to get a real raise. This is an unfortunately situation since I don't think I can get the pay jump I need unless I leave the company and then come back."

Technical sales management,2.0,"Aug 30, 2010",Former employee,"IBM has that aura of being a great place to work.  The near collapse of the company during the 1980's tarnished that image, and experience folks understand the realities of both the luster and the rust.  

In a company of 300,000 I would be foolish to try and depict the overall company ""image"", however with more than seven years of experience in the software sales segment of the business I saw some general (negitive) trends.

In order to reduce operating costs a large percentage of the employees work from home.  Many teams are comprised of staff  scattered around the globe, which makes building work relationship more difficult.  Conversely this structure provides a lot of schedule flexibility.","In looking at any position within IBM one must evaluate whether the position has requirements to exist where ever you are located.  Ongoing cost cutting efforts may well eliminate your position or ship the position offshore (in the long term).  
There are annual efforts to reduce the bottom n% (5-15%) of low performers acrosss the company.  If you are in a team of superstars, the team will loose their assigned percentage - regardless of the impact.
In order to achieve continued growth, the company buys a lot of smaller companies.  If you are working in an area of the business that has been enhanced throough a purchase, you risk being cast aside once the new venture comes on-line."
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"Jun 25, 2017","Former employee, more than 8 years","- In the past there has been a liberal work from home policy. I'm not sure how much longer that will last.

- Terrible or none existent bonuses. 
- Management mostly concerned with how to preserve and progress their careers and has little interest in progressing staff careers. 
- Software engineering organization driven by rigid sales motivated deadlines with little consideration for sound software development practices.  This creates substandard software services that are unmaintainable. But Sales doesn't care and engineering management team is too afraid to push back. 
- Bluemix IS an awful mess and any product or service that has to integrate with it WILL be made worse by having to integrate and adhere to the terrible bureaucracy that exists within it."

There are generations of trust behind you.  Generally speaking, first line managers are pretty good and are kind of in the same boat as regular employees.","Our performance rating system is a ridiculous leftover from when IBM needed to cut the fat.  The fat is all gone, believe me!  In general, this is a hard time for engineers at any company.

IBM recently got rid of alternate travel, which is a well known perk that virtually every other firm in the consulting industry offers. The reasoning was dubious at best and signifies a disconnect between upper management and the consultants with their boots on the ground.

Poor compensation, questionable job security (especially long-term), and an ever-diminishing sense of community contribute to a massive morale epidemic.

Now are the days of over-the-phone performance evaluation with a manager you know only by name, and ""virtual teaming"" with people you will never in your life meet face to face.

While the IBM name looks great on a resume, non-managerial skills are crippling. Ten years of IBM middleware technical experience gives you terrific qualifications. To work for IBM.

Financial raise and bonus pools have dried up in recent years despite recent profit gains.

US-based hires are few and very far between. College recruiting is a memory.

Global resources, while just as pleasant and able as domestic resources, can be stifling at a professional level. The length of conference calls depends entirely on the moderator's ability to wade through accents. Emails and SameTime messages arrive in a variety of languages.

Far more middle management, mandatory training, and conference calls than is efficient."

- Huge mismatch between employee's skills and project placement.  The emphasis is putting lower bands who are cheap labor onto projects that need bodies asap.
- Horrible experience working at the USPS and was required to be on the project for a minimum of a year and most likely two years.  Worked 6 days a week including Sunday mornings on client site at 4am.
- Inability to move from project to project.  I had almost 10 IBMers leave the company during my 9 months on my project because movement to another project was so impossible, and I did the same.

- So many layers of management and bureaucracy. Upper management were often out of touch and developers often felt underappreciated or powerless. 
- Almost never got bonuses and when we did, it was so small I was embarrassed to mention it to friends that worked at other places. There were hardly any incentive to do exceptional or give my all when it'll often go unappreciated. 
- No longer an innovative company for many reasons - one reason being that the innovation often comes because someone wants a promotion not because they're solving a great need in the industry. There is so much process and bureaucracy, there is hardly any inspiration for innovation. There is also little incentive to try something new because you know there will be no reward for it (no bonuses) and it'll be met with so much resistance and process, it's just not worth fighting.

Aggressively software audit driven, which destroys innocent client relationships. Sadly, most all decisions are made by Finance which has too much control over client relationships because they do not understand how to support Sales and Technical teams to support clients. Management/Finance will drive out expensive/experienced people, to replace them with affordable/inexperienced people, including zero IT experience, no Computer Science degree, no white collar experience, in a technology company. Why? Because IBM overpaid $38B for Redhat and thus, cuts are everywhere, no one is safe. Deep cuts in product support, product development, relationships, technical expertise, and thus, a lack of resources to do the right thing for clients. As a Sales person, if you care about relationships, you could spend months with. your client on a product escalations, because there is just a lack of people and skills everywhere. You join the product support escalations not because its your job, but because your employer isn't treating your client well, and someone needs to heal the relationship, but there is no help available.

Client representative,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"There are a number of reasons why IBM can be a great fit for you. Most importantly, the company encourages a healthy work/life balance. Time off is abundant, and the hours are not rigorous. In addition the company treats many employees as ""mobile"" workers -- working from home or working out of an office as needed. Also, since the company is so large, there are a number of perks and benefits. So, if you are interested in a relaxed work-environment and lots of flexibility, this is a great option. Also, the IBM name on a resume is a great asset.","IBM does have some challenges, and is not an optimal choice for all. Since the ""mobile employee"" concept is enforced for many groups, it becomes challenging to develop a sense of teamwork or camaraderie. There notion of the office ""water cooler"" is non-existent. One might argue that such ""off the record"" interaction does not necessarily contribute to productivity -- the issue is that inter-personal, informal interaction is limited. The other challenge is one that many large companies will face -- different groups are often incentivized in different manners. It is not uncommon to have internal groups encouraged (and rewarded) to operate along divergent paths. Lastly, you will come across an arrogance at IBM -- that ""Big Blue"" is infallible."
Software qa manager,3.0,"Sep 22, 2016",Former employee,"For a majority of time I was there, I worked for one product line.  Some areas of the company have good local managers / leadership, which helps to provide a good working atmosphere where an employee can feel fulfilled with their contributions.

Salary seems to be a little better than average.","IBM is currently undergoing a complete transformation of it's business and business it deems 'not in its core' are being dismantled, with little regard to the intelligent resources that it affects.

Outwardly, IBM states that it invests in its employees and will allow them to move from between divisions / products, but in reality it provides little support to those attempting to get education to keep up-to-date technically or professionally (tuition support is touted but seldom is provided). 

Severance of those ""let go"" is now down to 4 weeks maximum.  Employees who are newly hired are given a 2 year grace period which keeps them from being included in job actions, but after that they can be targeted.

401k matching is only done on a yearly basis, so if you leave the company during the year there is no compensation.

Raises are minimal and depend on the area of the organization you work - personally I had received no raises for 5 years, although my performance reviews were between exceptional and acceptable all 5 years.

IBM is in the process of attempting to collocate resources into key offices with little to no ability to work remotely.  This has also affected work-life balance within the company."
Server build technician iii,2.0,"Oct 9, 2020","Current employee, more than 3 years","Training is good and there is a lot of resources for continued education.
The work load is balanced, and management should be receptive to a desire to do more for DC Operations.
Being a fulltime IBM employee you will receive the standard employee benefits (PTO, 401k, health/dental/vision).","Career growth is limited by how much of a priority you are to your manager. Communication is difficult and often obscured when trying to develop internally within IBM. Perhaps due to Data Center Operations being physically separate (and sometimes temporally) from other teams, and IBM Cloud being a separate ""child company"" acquired and in a continuous state of integration into IBM.
Based on the last couple years, full-time hires are decreasing in favor of contract workers without benefits. IBM should offer full-time employment on completion of training, but this could also change.
New hires are usually stuck on evening or night shift once training has progressed enough (1-2 months), moving off this will again depend on how well you communicate with management, or it may get you moved to a different DC site.
You are responsible for the office environment and equipment maintenance. If you and your coworkers don't stay on top of it, expect tools to degrade. You will have to be your own IT, while also dealing with IBM remote help desk (my experiences with them have been poor, regardless of the time of day I called in)."

Process engineer,3.0,"Jul 30, 2008",Current employee,I feel the company is pretty good with the work life balance.  Because the company is very advance some are even allowed to work remotely.  As an engineer supporting the manufacturing line you could essentially do a good portion of your job from home.  The company also provides good benefits at least compared to the other companies I have looked at which is really only two other companies.  They also have other little perks like different corporate discounts and rewards for great achievements (eventhough I hear they are not as good as they used to be).  I did enjoy most of the people are work with.  There are a good number of helpful people with in the company,It seems there is a lot of backwards thinking in IBM and not just within some divisions.  It seems to be company wide.  It seems like changes always loop back around someone.  The high level managers think they have an understanding of what happens at the lowest level but don't.  There always seems to be a different panic attack each day so it can get stressful at times.  Pick your day and you have some serious issue going on.  The meetings are endless and often pointless.  The meetings always make it seems like it's deja vu.  There is more time spent talking about the problem than actually going to correct it.
Senior managing consultant,3.0,"Aug 21, 2008",Former employee,"IBM is in the cutting edge of rolling out technology solutions to meet business challenges.  Whatever IBM comes out with like eBusiness, Information on Demand, Websphere, etc. is copied by the competition, but IBM is always ahead of the game.  The level of technical competence is high in the right pockets, which ensures that they could always execute with the right people on the team as members or SMEs.","There is an incredible amount of overhead between the people who do the work and the level of associate partners, partners, regional managers, practice leads, practice managers, industry leads, industry VPs, competency VP, etc in the Services area.  I would generate about $385,000-$555,000 every year in consulting revenue for the company, but my bonuses and raises were a joke for the kind of contribution I made to the company.  The overhead in Services must be addressed."
Consultant,2.0,"Jun 11, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","The people I work with are really smart. Great for the resume, as IBM is a pretty well respected company. My coworkers have left for great tech companies and top 5 business schools. Good benefits (but getting worse).","Hard to get recognition for good work. You're only as good as your PBC rating (IBM's end of year rating system), which can get pretty political and bureaucratic. Management is out of touch with employees and how they feel about the company. People at my level are VERY negative about IBM. Lots of turnover. In Public Sector you can get stuck on a project forever (I've been on the same one for my entire time at IBM and would have to burn a lot of bridges to get off of it, if I even could). 401K matching once a year is bad for employees. Do not feel connected to company as a whole. Management is out of touch with how employees feel about the company. Hard to motivate for IBM's success when the company doesn't give bonuses or raises for people who are supposedly performing well. After almost two years here, and performing very well according to all of my evaluations, I am actually making LESS money than when I started when you consider inflation and the fact that company healthcare costs have gone up."
Applications programming specialist,3.0,"May 25, 2016","Current employee, more than 3 years","IBM is so big that the Pros/Cons depend somewhat on what group you are working in.

Where I work all my coworkers were good, hardworking people willing to help out. There is a good work life balance, lots of vacation days, sick leave, and flexible hours. Medical, Dental, and Health insurance.","Management has very poor communication with its employees. My direct manager goes months without checking in on my to see how things are going. Emails from upper management are full of near meaningless business jargon such as ""Creating a playbook to sharpen your digital edge"".

The business model in my group requires employees to find projects on their own. IBM does provide a tool for finding projects but often times that tool call doesn't list all the projects or lists incorrect information about the project. Often times, projects are found through less formal methods such as word of mouth.

Pay is atrocious. Far below the industry average.

Email spam. Various people from around the company send you emails about projects and events that are not relevant to you at all. It got so bad I had to create a junk mail folder."

- The company will take care of its employees. In cases of natural disasters they are on top of things and ready to help. There is near 0 chance of discrimination of any kind, this is not something that IBM messes around with.
- Many experts available to consult in just about any area of technology, and business.
-","- Poor technical leadership, too many promotions to higher level technical positions that are based on politics, friendships, side-deals, and based on upper management perceived ""success"". Many high level technical folks manage up and are disconnected with the folks under them providing no real technical leadership for the ones doing the real work.
- Too much focus on dates, time-to-market. This trumps quality of the products, solutions, and services. BAD. The company is very large, so this tends to be driven by the culture established by the executives responsible for the various areas.

* Promotes imaginative and innovative thinking
* Flexible work schedule
* Variety of family hr programs","* IBM's top priority is MONEY - at the cost of their employees - IBM has turned cheap on it's employees
* Classroom Education has essentially demolished - most all classes are on-line self-study and are very limited in selection and MANY of those require management approval. If you are a programmer and want to take a class at a community college to enhance your skills that directly apply to your current position - the cost is yours! Even tuition as low as $125!
* Employee health benefits have greatly reduced - large deductibles and co-pays with limited in-network selection; Randy McDonald warned RTP, NC employees that if Obama was elected, IBMers would pay the price...AND WE HAVE!
* Business travel has greatly reduced - educational conferences, even for top performers, are unheard of.
* Coffee/tea anyone? That will cost you the SAME price as Starbucks...$1.60 and more...NO KIDDING! NOTHING IS FREE anymore! Cafeteria food quality has gone down and their prices are more than outside the IBM facilities!
* So as to save money in utilities, office supplies and workspace, IBM encourages work from home, thus, reducing team spirit and production.
* Salary and Raises? They are getting more and more skimpy and give team members identical excuses, regardless of performance.
* IBM should stand for INDIAN BUSINESS MACHINES. Outsourcing to India is huge and hurting so many IBM US employees. Job stability is threatened with outsourcing."

- They tried very hard to make the intern program fun and to bring us together socially. There were intern presentations, Main Event night, boat on Lake Austin.
- Pay was very good.","- Required to use internal dev tools like BlueMix that lower our productivity because they always crash.
- As an intern I came to the office every day but most workers at IBM ""work from home"" very often. I've heard that it's even worse outside of Watson.
- Pay arrived late, especially the promised Lump Sum Travel Reimbursement, which arrived 2 months after I had arrived.
- Senior management seems disconnected from reality on the ground. For example, there was a two-day intern finale event. They decided that the interns would spend paid work hours bagging rice for charity (which I think could be a great idea). They set a goal for 10,000 rice packets and we didn't pack that many during the scheduled events. The organizers were supposed to help with the whole process, but they didn't seem to care once the Instagram pictures were taken. So the rep from the charity was basically abandoned to pack the last 1,000 and pack it onto a truck.
- Lots of ""not my problem"" attitude about cleaning up common areas, sharing training data, etc. Most people are just concerned with their individual team."
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"May 11, 2017","Former employee, more than 10 years","IBM is still a great name to have on your resume. They do some pretty cool projects, and you learn to work hard at IBM. For some people, things turn out really well at IBM if they get the right first project.","Projects are chronically understaffed. It's hard to get a good assignment. It seems the best work is hand-picked for certain people. YMMV, but the company is not interested in developing you. They will keep you in the same assignment for a long time, and make it very hard to transfer. In my case, I did a stint as a Support person. I then applied to a Development proper position (which I had done previously). I started out doing Development, but in less than 2 months, Support duties were added to my job, and then my job became that almost 100%. After years at that job working hard, I transferred to a new job, and I noticed that once again, I wasn't allowed to go to a Development proper position, they wanted me to do same job again!!!  Even though there was plenty of Development work to do on my new team, they would rather keep the project understaffed and behind schedule, than to hire one more ready and willing developer to help out, and go out of their way to keep me in a position I no longer wanted to perform."

Option to work from home which lets you avoid the commute.","Compensation is below market; my base pay was comparable to average pay according to Glassdoor but the bonus was basically non-existent.  I literally got ~$700 after tax for the bonus!   Many underfunded products/projects and long lead times to get things done lead to subpar products that aren't competitive.  No ability to retain good talent; see good people who can leave defect to other tech companies (i.e. Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Startups, etc.) all the time.  Lack of opportunity to grow in the company.  Since IBM is shrinking, there are almost no attractive opportunities to switch roles and get promoted.   IBM is getting it's butt kicked by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in IaaS/SaaS/PaaS and AI and it is unlikely IBM will be able to reverse this market trend anytime soon.  Senior Management is too secure in their positions.  IBM has underperformed vs. peers for a decade yet most of the Senior Management team have retained their positions."

Positions in IBM customer facing roles build skills that will greatly benefit you in your next job, and you may learn how to recognize employers that you do not want to consider in the future.  IBM still has excellent products and these are worthwhile assets in your kit for future employment, especially if you are technical, and for pre-sales technical roles they still provide time to get and keep those technical skills.   You still get to work with some of the finest people in the IT industry, though they do not tend tend to stay long any more once they understand the way IBM views them and their compensation.","Lower pay than other companies, benefits in a death spiral and management lack of respect for the employee.   Compensation growth is non-existent, in fact likely to be negative regardless of your performance.  If you are not in a customer facing role your job is most probably going to a low cost country, though it may not happen quickly (IBM is accomplishing this slowly so it does not attract too much media attention).   A mobile workforce, as IBM has, often means working alone without support, and without adequate tools.   IBM expense and infrastructure policies mean spending hours a week accounting for travel and activity, which if you have service level agreements must be done on your own time."

There is usually a greater autonomy and less dependence on partners as a young consultant.

The people are a good mix of smart technology and business people who are driven but generally approachable compared to Deloitte (Jerks) and Accenture (Engineering Nerds).","IBM is not disorganized but there is no way it can be considered organized.  

The performance review and promotion system is one of the most bureaucratic, time consuming, non-value added and just annoying around.  Unclear expectations for moving to the next levels; levels spaced very very far apart.  A round down system that lowers your performance to your worst review which penalizes you for doing just ok on a first project which you are then penalized for one to two years depending on when you come in during the cycle.

Many managers are not helpful in developing you, encouraging you, or even answering e-mails.  There is high turnover for consultants here; they chalk this up to the nature of the industry.  That may be true but many leave because there is simply no easy way to get promoted other than to leave and come back.  Other offers during employment etc. aren't really considered in this system.

Two words: Lotus Notes."
It specialist,2.0,"Jun 8, 2016","Current employee, more than 8 years","Working remotely, health benefits, coworkers, and first line manager.","401(k) matching once a year, the lack of being able to reach anyone human in HR or any other department, lack of communication from the top. 
The biggest drawback, the constant layoff's, or as IBM calls them, Resource Actions.  While Companies layoff employee's, it is usually to rid themselves of deadwood.  At IBM, the cut to make the balance sheet look better.  Currently they are laying off as the Company transforms itself, but after 4 years of declining revenues, quarterly layoffs, the problem is not the workers, it is the upper management.  Being in sales if I have a few bad quarters, I get terminated, upper management has them and they get a bonus?  
Don't apply here if you want an employer you can grow with, here you will go down with the ship that is sinking faster than the Titanic. 
The CEO keeps changing direction and shedding assets to keep the shareholders earning.
The ship is sinking a slow but deliberate death, unless the top managers are changed it will continue to decline."

Management is odd: 1st/2nd line managers spend most of their time trying to be ""Project Managers"", not too much focus actual management.  There's a project management hierarchy that overlaps with these first lines, and adds little value ( though that might be the best career path).  Zero training. Zero travel. Development projects are overbooked. IBM is really pushing off-shoring to India.  You have to do your job, plus train a team of Indian developers; Middle management is pretty bad, they aim to please Sr management, customers, without consideration to their team.  Sr Management reaps millions, off-shores, and lays technical people off ; their is not a good connection between the team and Sr Management.  7-10 levels of managers in between, too much."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Dec 28, 2016",Former employee,"good 401k thanks to Ibm, that is all","merge is a company built on acquiring other companies, stripping them down, putting products they buy into maintenance mode and not developing them further, and bleeding the customer bases dry.  They have no concept of customer satisfaction, priority number one is pushing the sale even if it's something we can't implement or does not make sense for a customer.  Because all they know how to do is acquire and destroy, they have no idea how to develope something on their own that actually works (iconnect network for example).  Now Ibm thinks merge is going to be able to help release new products utilizing the Watson engine this year, not holding my breath on that one.  All departments are silos and getting them to work together is impossible, there is a culture of if it does not fall into my job description leave me alone.  Their sales leadership can be best compared to that of a used car salesman.  They litteraly would rather have their sales people sit at a prospects site for the last two weeks of the quarter and endlessly beg for the deal even if they have been told no decision will be made by then.  Nepotism runs rampant, the high level positions held by a number of upper managers who have zero qualifications to be in that position is amazing.  Upper management would rather have allies and yes men around them rather than hire someone who could implement meaningful change and question the current conditions."

Anonymous employee,2.0,"Jun 20, 2014","Current employee, more than 1 year","IBM owns and develops excellent technology that can really make the world a better place. The engineers are top notch, and they are highly valued within their silo. The company breadth and reach allows it to come up with innovative and creative solutions that has the potential to touch almost every aspect of life, from smarter cities to big data.","Almost every decision made is a ""breadbox"" mentality - can I save a buck right now by ___. The company is struggling to deal with the shift from hardware and software licensing to pure cloud models. This has a cascading impact on the broader company because it pressures the field to generate more revenue in lightly depressed markets to compensate for rapidly declining markets. In other words: unrealistic expectations. On top of that, IBM leadership second-guesses itself annually, moving back and forth between similar org structures. In addition, the company is so big that many of its offerings overlap with each other, confusing the sales force and the customer as to which solution is the right fit, ultimately coming down to who the rep is and what solution do they get paid on (versus what is right for the customer). Lastly, it is not a meritocracy. You advance your career inside IBM because of who you know, not what you can do."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Mar 6, 2016","Former employee, more than 10 years","A very large company with many career potentials. Worldwide presence makes it a great company to work for if you have an interest to work overseas. IBM was ahead of its time in so many ways including embracing social, open source, and cloud as the core of its business. Company has very smart people working in it. Work/life balance is good.","As much as the company was ahead of its time in many areas: cloud, social, mobile, and open source, it didn't do enough to make a lasting impact in the industry. There are smart, strategic IBMers who had long identified those up-trends. But senior management hung on to status-quo, focusing on mainframes, middle-ware, and once high margin hardware business. 

There is little to no career development. Most people are ""tenured"" are staying to retire. Executives are compensated based on earnings per share. This inherently steer them to cost cut in places where it matters most: high quality hires, education, and technology investment. Short-term gains and complacency lead to long-term decline of the company. Most executives are just waiting for retirement, leaving a shadow of a company that IBM once was."
Summit program solution sales specialist,5.0,"Sep 7, 2016",Current employee,"Summit is life changing! Throughout the 6-9 months of training, people are taken from being recent graduates with little experience to young sales professionals ready to sell for Big Blue. In the program, you learn how to not only be an effective sales person, but you also learn about how to engage with C-level execs. The salary is outstanding and the company is focused on investing in you through education. Managers are fantastic and truly care about enabling you to succeed. There is some travel involved. Lastly, the best part about Summit is that you are put with 30-40 people your age that you stay with throughout the program. This is not only great for networking, but it's absolutely crucial to building the culture and your experience at IBM. Some of the people in my group have become my best friends.","There are some cons about working here- IBM is an extremely large company and it's easy to get lost in the mix. It was also difficult initially to find enough work to do because they start everyone off slow. However, with that being said, it's on YOU to make sure you have your needs met. Whether that is by asking for more work, getting involved on different project teams, or telling your manager you're overwhelmed. A lot of my peers complain about things in the program that they have complete control over to change."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Apr 13, 2017",Current employee,"Great compensation & benefits.  Lower level team members are great & hard working.  Good & a wide variety of experience gained quickly. Working from home has been a perk, but they are getting rid of that option for most positions.","Written by a millennial: Currently, IBM is going through a massive change where everyone has to relocate to one of 6 cities.  This tactic is to get rid of the middle/higher level positions who are older & cost more for employment & targeting millennials to hire in.  This tactic disregards the expertise that the mid-higher level employees have in their field.  Team members who have been at IBM for 20+ years are unappreciated & forced into retirement or to look for a new job. 

In addition to IBM not appreciating their loyal & experienced employees, IBM has a horrible onboarding process.  Starting as a university hire, I was just dropped in without understanding my role, the dynamics of the team, & was assigned as the lead for large events within the first couple months.  If IBM plans to replace all of the experienced IBM employees with new young hires, they need to have a very thorough training process in plan based on roles that has a single person assigned to the success of the new hire.

Lastly, all direction comes from the top down.  Reorganization happens at least once a year if not more.  The majority of the time people are trying to understand their role & new team members instead of being able to get quality work done."
Digital sales stream channel manager,5.0,"Apr 18, 2017","Current employee, less than 1 year","If you want to be successful and change the world you work for a company like IBM.  IBM is on the cutting edge of technology and the opportunities are endless to those willing to work for it and earn it.  Make no mistake about it… its highly competitive, edgy, stressful and at times it can feel like pure madness.  This is what it takes to be a world leader in technology.  IBM can help you tap into the greatest version of you and come out on the other side a contributor to the brilliance that is IBM.
If you are interested in more than just benefits and you want to make a difference in today’s world… IBM is the place for you.  (FYI… benefits are great).  If you are just looking for a paycheck, “swipe LEFT”.  All things being equal IBM has their share of issues just like every other company.  No matter what company you work for, when faced with a challenge, you can complain about it or build a business case to fix it.  At IBM you can be part of the solution that fixes the problem.  
IBM is a wealth of vision and inspiration and always looking forward to the future.  I would challenge anyone reading this to be the change you want to see in the world… become an IBMer.

No yearly pay increase. Once you’re hired in, getting a raise is next to impossible even for stellar work. You get great reviews but keep the same salary, year after year, so you’re in essence working for less money due to inflation and when cost of living goes up each year. I’ve been working for ibm for 10 years, hired in at 100k, gotten great reviews for doing more, growing my skill set, advancing IBMs client base and technical position, and in the 10 years, I’ve gotten a couple 1200$ profit sharing bonus and a 1% pay increase and one 2% pay increase.......in 10 years. So I’m in essence making about 17% less less than when I started. (My money doesn’t go as far as it did 10 years ago, doesn’t pay the same amount of bills).

If you wish, you can have a varied career, changing jobs as your interests change, while maintaining the continuity and benefits of having a single employer.","The company can be somewhat management-heavy at times.  Sometimes it appears that there are levels of middle management that exist simply to keep people busy.  This seems to be especially the case in some of the older organizations that have been producing the same or similar products for many years.

If you are looking for a stable direction and reliable resources to support that direction, you may be terribly disappointed."
Advisory software engineer,3.0,"Jun 22, 2016",Former employee,"If your job allows, the ability to be able to work from home is a definite plus because I am able to avoid Austin's commutes.  The benefit package is pretty  good if you are single.","The thinking behind and implementation of the ineffective and destructive performance review process is supposed to be changing this year.  The challenge for the management team will be how to effectively change the thinking behind the old approach to performance review, with it's focus on ""distributions"" or quotas. This thinking is very ingrained in our corporate culture. Sadly, the previous system was build on outright untruths formally perpetuated by the management team, such as, ""There is no quota system."", which is legendary within IBM. You cannot build a team when staff are effectively played off against each other to improve their ""relative contribution"".  This would be at the heart of why staff avoid taking on projects with inherent risk because they are afraid of being punished if they don't achieve an aggressive goal by loosing their meager pay increase, being ranked lower, and possibly becoming the target of a layoff."
Senior managing consultant,2.0,"Sep 28, 2016","Former employee, more than 1 year","Global reach, a lot of bright people, brand recognition (though it is skewed towards computing even today). Base pay was good.","Be careful, experienced professionals! I was dropped in at a relatively high level and had not projects from the get-go in the 4th quarter, and they were not closing a lot of work at that time. I didn't get on a billable project for almost six months. In month 17, I was given a lay-off notice based on my prior year performance because of that 1st quarter with no billable utilization... Also, be wary of Partner and Associate Partner underlying interests - watch you back.

I thought I'd have a great opportunity to help out on large projects and run small projects - with all the breadth of industry and the thousands of ""open seats"", but without that early opportunity to really get known, you are dead. I had some significant successes in industry before moving to this role, but the capabilities were not easily conveyed given this lack of early opportunity to work on things in front of key decision-makers."

Manager,2.0,"Jan 31, 2009",Current employee,"More stability than most companies in the IT industry.  IBM offers flexible working hours, a true commitment to working remotely, and the tools to empower remote employees  The company offers solid benefits, and because it touches all areas in IT,  employees do have a chance to experience different areas.","The communications function is highly bureaucratic, highly political, and overall does not necessarily reward the most competent employees, but instead ones that fit a specific HR box.  All companies have to deal with this issue, but it's especially bad at IBM and in the Comms function.  It is not a function where young comms professionals should seek to work, although if you have at least five years of experience and want a big brand name, I would recommend IBM only as a short-term (three years) assignment before moving on to another company to leverage your skills and knowledge.   It is not a place to plan a career."
Supply chain manager,2.0,"Apr 2, 2009",Current employee,"Mostly good people and bright co-workers. IBM is good about letting people work from home (which is nice, because it's much easier to tolerate working with an obnoxious management team when you're in a remote location).","Executive management team likes to micro-manage the business, which causes LOTS of extra and unnecessary workload.  You spend a very large percentage of your time preparing for and giving status updates to senior management (often with technical details beyond their ability to understand).   There are some very good technical people at IBM , but the management system is so oppressive and smothering that few creative ideas ever see the light of day.   

IBM works very, very hard at creating the ILLUSION of being a good employer, but it's actions show otherwise.  Lots of companies have had to do lay-offs, but at least most of them have had the guts to publicly acknowledge the actions they are taking. IBM on the other hand prefers to surreptitiously do its lay-offs and off-shoring of jobs while keeping its employees in the dark."
Senior software sales representative,3.0,"Jul 23, 2010",Former employee,"I worked at IBM for more than 30 years where I made WONDERFUL lifelong friends.

Washington, Long Island, NY. 
I started selling Office Products, became a first line then a second line sales manager, and traveled extensively to exciting places around the world which I may have not enjoyed if it were on my own dime.

If I had an appointment I just blocked off the time on my calendar and went.  Vacation time was easy to get, very lenient approval process.  People with kids were always able to go to important things or even just volunteer in their kids' class.  As long as you are meeting deadlines and not really screwing up they were very flexible.  On the flip side, some times long hours were necessary.","stability
stress level- schedules are so aggressive it makes for a very stressful environment
little to no investment in employees' learning

If you're a early career ME there aren't a lot of options for you, it can be very frustrating.  A lot of hardware has already been sold and there's always a threat that more will be sold so stability is not good in this area.  Its hard to get money for certifications and school, not impossible but you have to really go after it."

IBM's management mandates too much data-entry with project tracking that drives employee measurement metrics with no indication of the outcomes. IBM has become too political and has adopted a woke culture that seeks to raise awareness of specific groups while making others feel guilty when they are innocent. IBM tends to lead from behind and focuses too much on the finances versus the technologies, and listens more to Wall Street than Main Street. IBM fosters an environment that creates internal competition by over communicating the successes and gains of employees who reach career milestones that they want to enforce, like certifications."

Software engineering manager,3.0,"Jun 11, 2008",Current employee,"Working at IBM is like getting another master's degree.  There is so much opportunity to learn in this company, and in general, the willingness of senior technical leaders to teach (and of managers to support such education) is remarkable.  Although organizational politics will sometimes create barriers, the potential of this large, talented organization can be incredible when focused & engaged on a goal.  IBM also seems to be one of the leading firms in terms of ""walking the talk"" on work life balance.  While extensive use of work/life integration tools may be seen by some as stepping off the career fast-track, it is widely used, and the level of flexibility in many divisions/organizations is quite high compared to peer firms.","Bureaucracy is incredibly high.  People often compare it to the US Military or other such government bodies.  There will be 6 levels of approval for a $250 purchase.   There are layers upon layers of executive management.  At any given time, at least one other IBM division will be designing a product that competes with yours."
Global technology services,2.0,"Jan 17, 2009",Current employee,"IBM offers employees a solid brand name, ample benefits, and compensates managers well.  There are many smart people, with a positive overall culture.  Employees and managers enjoy helping each other, and IBM can be a great place to develop your skills and become a stronger person.  Don't confuse personal development with career opportunities, though.","Raises are rare and bonuses small, so either negotiate a high salary before being hired, or expect to be underpaid for some time.  A bloated, bureaucratic management structure weighs down the whole organization, so innovation comes slowly and way behind most of the marketplace.  All aspects of work at IBM are process-driven, so expect mountains of rules and documentation that frequently confound common sense.

Probably the worst thing about IBM is the employee rating system.  You are assigned your rating in a group meeting with all first and second line managers, and there is literally no objective criteria built in to the process.  To be rated well, you must be very good at managing relationships with your manager and his
peers.  The people who thrive are frequently not the top contributors, but the ones who self-promote and manage perceptions well.  IBM enforces a brutal ratings curve on the first and second line managers, so if you are not the leader of the pack, do not expect raises or promotions.  You may or may not have job security, depending on the year."
Associate partner,2.0,"Jul 17, 2014","Former employee, more than 10 years","It's a big company that has lots of diversity, exceptional staff, and a long history of reinventing itself despite bouts with failed leadership.  Historically, benefits were good and stated company ""values"" are focused on ""win-win"" philosophies.  Work-life balance was reasonable, and employees felt valued.  In some parts of the company, shreds of this history remain.

If you find the ""right"" group / division (likely in a low-wage or developing country), there's still hope of a bright future and a potentially rewarding career.","With the second consecutive CEO who lacks the ability to communicate coherent vision and direction to his/her employees, (aside from the relentless drive toward $20 EPS in 2015 which should be a byproduct of stellar performance, not a business target) the company has once again lost its way.  Layoffs of high-knowledge employees and inward-looking short-sighted policies rule the day.

Customer service has deteriorated as a result, and IBM's published sales numbers clearly paint the picture of the current trajectory.  Fear and stifling control are the bureaucratic tools-du-jour, with hollow strategies and PR-generating ""partnerships"" rounding out the equation.  IBM's nimbler and more customer-focused competitors are once again eating its lunch technologically, commercially, and service-wise."

IBM has been very good regarding working from home and working flexible hours around personal needs.,"The last 5-6 years pay increases for experienced, high-performing, staff engineers have not kept up with the dollar increases in the cost of health insurance premiums IBM has passed on to employees.  IBM used to be known as a family-friendly company by providing good benefit coverages for families of employees.  In the last decade, IBM has shifted the burden of providing insurance benefits for employees' spouses and dependents to the employees without increasing the pay to compensate for the added costs.  Compensation and benefit plans are geared toward bringing in young, single, employees at competitive starting salaries who generally only last a few years, while ignoring the dependable, experienced, knowledgeable employees who become stuck in the position of perpetually training the new kids who either wash out or are put on the fast-track ahead of the gray-hairs.  The employees who are the backbone of IBM are unappreciated, but often have no choice about leaving because they do not want to uproot their families."

Yes, IBM looks good to have on your resume but it's not worth the soul sucking torture you have to go through every day. Training is a joke, they rely on the person who had the role before you to train you in... my past two roles I've gotten because someone has been leaving IBM and they didn't really care about training me. This has left me feeling like I've been ""thrown to the wolves"" with both of my roles... BUT it's ok, because it's not like the work you do actually adds any value to IBM. 

I've feel like I've gained very little work experience in the finance field. 

If you do happen to take an FA job here, I hope you don't plan on growing your career here. There are very few opportunities for advancement. I guess I shouldn't say that, the Rochester COE does seem to love to do vertical promotions... you know, the type where you get more work but no extra pay. 

Overall, I highly advise that you only take a job here as a very last resort if you can't get another job out of college."

On a scale of 1-4 (1 = best), I was rated a 2 or 2+ for every year for over 20 years. I made my quota in 2008, was told multiple times during 2008 what a great job I was doing by my manager, then I was laid off in Feb 2009.
- Staffed very thin - be sure to take your laptop with you on vacation and set aside a few hours a day to work.  Actively trying to move most of their US based resources off shore to lower cost countries (""stealth"" layoffs of over 4600 people in Feb 2009 never announced to the press).  
- In sales, a generally high base salary (good) but limited leverage as they always adjust the quota, or ratchet back the pay plan to limit potential payouts. 
- Constant change and reorganizations, warranted in some cases, however it's just movement for the sake of movement at times. Management is sometimes disconnected from the relationships that the front line team builds with customers."
Storage administrator,2.0,"Jun 17, 2015","Former employee, more than 3 years","- The work from home options at the site were very good. We were only required to be in office a few days per week, with the ability to flex that as low as two days per week. 
- The managers were very understanding of how rough it was to work at IBM and didn't try and compound those issues.","- The instability was ridiculous. It seemed like every few months you'd hear about the next big wave of layoffs that were about to happen. Morale in the office dipped, and as each layoff passed the office became emptier and emptier until maybe 10% of desks per each floor were filled.
- They hired mostly non-technical people to perform technical jobs. When I had to teach a coworker who has been there for 3 years what ""ls"" and ""cd"" do on their AIX servers, I knew this was the wrong place to be.
- Major outsourcing to India. Basically every job was at risk of being outsourced, or in the process of being outsourced by the time I quit. The Indians they hire to replace the American jobs didn't seem to have much formal education in the field or any experience. It was a hassle training them.
- Second level management and higher are purely about the bottom line with zero regard for the human beings lives they are ruining by penny pinching and shipping jobs overseas. First line management also despised them, but they were powerless."

Consulting it specialist,2.0,"Jul 6, 2008",Current employee,"IBm offers a pretty good work life balance although that is starting to disappear. The benefits are pretty good too, and the 401K plan is possibly one of the best. You do have a certain amount of  flexibility and  the potential to move around the company, alhough this will likely depend on which group you are in and how well the business is doing. It is  not a given by any means which is what IBM advertised to potential employees. There is a great wealth of information and education avaialble to anyone who wants to stay educated and informed. The IBM name on your resume doesnt hurt either.","There is way too much bureaucracy and redundancy especially at the management level. There are sometimes literally 3 people to do the sae thing and to attend the same meeting. Each will have his or her own agenda too. The quality of the management is very ordinary overall though there are some really sharp people. All in all, the reason IBM is surviving is because of it's technical talent of which there is a substantial amount. This does not mean there is no deadwood as there as meany people who are there just to colect a salary. The promotion process is not always fair and career growth seems to depend too much on which group you are in. Life in IBM is much better as a manager or above a certain band level(* 9 and above)"
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jul 13, 2008",Former employee,"I worked at IBM Global Business Services for 2 years.  IBM GBS is a great place to build technical skills and get experience with high profile clients through implementation projects.  There are a lot of older, more experienced consultants who are more than happy to mentor and help younger consultants build deep technical skills in ERP packages.  There was not a lot of pressure to perform and work/life balance was good.  The performance review system seemed to run well and I felt I got the recognition I deserved at the end of the year.  The training was good and I felt satisfied with the learning opportunities.","IBM GBS operates like a hybrid between a typical large industry company and a traditional consulting firm.  The nature of the work is similar to other consulting firms like Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, Capgemini, and BearingPoint.  Unfortunately, the nature of the internal operating model is more like working for a F100 company.  In other words, the raises are minimal and the company did not seem interested in retaining or differentiating top performers from the rest of the group.  As a result of this, there was massive attrition in the lower and middle ranks, especially for top performers.  Most of the people I started with are gone.  GBS also seemed to enjoy hiring older, more experienced consultants with no drive to progress up the chain."
Senior software engineer manager,4.0,"Apr 30, 2009",Former employee,"IBM supports a very flexible work schedule, focused on getting the job done rather than what hours were worked during the day.  Also, many jobs allow for some, all, or as-needed portion of the week to be worked from home at the employee's discretion.  Vacation time is self-managed and also very flexible.  The work environment (at least in Austin) is extremely casual.  There is a mind-numbing array of resources available to employees from freely available records detailing corporate policies, HR records, IT systems, capital requests, tools for managing corporate charge card, tools for booking your own corporate travel, on-line libraries, surplus stores, education, book ordering, volume printing, recreational activities, parks and facilities, etc., etc.  IBM also rewards innovation with awards for patent contributions.","Resource reductions without backfilling (at least in North America) leave too few resources overcommitted and burnt-out dreading the yearly review cycle.

Intranet search bites (i.e. while there are a mind-numbing array of services available, finding them is never easy)."
Sales,2.0,"Oct 8, 2018","Current employee, less than 1 year",6-12 month paid training with benefits.,"Salary is lower than what you could get in other sales/technical sales roles.

Prepare to do a lot do a lot of busy work. Some of the training is not relevant or helpful to the role you'll be doing and the important stuff is given a very surface level overview. If you want depth, that will be up to you, and your time and money. 

Because there are so many layers of management, you are often given very conflicting advice on what priorities should be and what you should be working on. ""It depends"" comes up a lot for answers to what should be simple questions. The phrase ""I'm By Myself"" is very much true and you will have to spend a considerable amount of time to find people who can give you meaningful help and guidance in your professional career.

As for co-workers, some are very nice and smart, but overall, many are  incredibly cliquey, arrogant, lack maturity and do not embrace the goals of having an inclusive and diverse work culture.  If you do not like networking or working on team projects with people like this, you will have a very difficult time in this program."

Senior program manager,2.0,"May 10, 2009",Current employee,"IBM offers diverse job opportunities due to its size and scope which enables mulitple jobs while staying with the same company.  Historically it has attracted smart people looking for this type of single-company career, allowing for extensive long-term personal relationships.  If you are selected to be a ""high potential individual"" then your work assignments will change at a fairly rapid pace and compensation will rise quickly as IBM tries to retain you. (Fall off that list and your career instantly transforms into a job.)  Mangement will push you into jobs you are not ready for to test your abilities to cope.","IBM is cutting expenses in order to drive executive compensation.  They are focused on employee expense, by cutting staff and nickle and diming in the US and other developed nations, and moving work to developing nations such as India, China and  the rest of the BRIC.  This is a rather sad state of affairs, where people are losing their jobs because IBM can find other people in other nations who will do the work for significantly less.  In the short term the savings to the company are real. In the long run, the spirt of the company will be lost."

Every year we lose something, they adjust something that takes money away from us and saves IBM money. In 2013, they moved the 401K match payout from payday to a lump sum at year end, and we missed out on all that interest. They moved the date raises are given to next year. They also decided not to pay out the bonuses they've paid every year since they started the program. No raise in 5+ years and I have much less to show for it. There is a major push to outsource most of the work over seas and only have about 15% of employees in the US. With so few US Employees, I get the sense that we are way too top heavy with management and all the overhead that comes with it."

Senior software engineer,4.0,"Oct 14, 2021","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM has many great programs for employees to grow in all aspects of their life and career. Management is very supportive in making sure you have an opportunity to take advantage of these programs and will encourage you to push yourself. Although there are moments where deadlines are critical and workload reaches capacity, these cycles typically don't last long as management often listens and finds a way to ensure you are not working yourself thin. Everyone is very helpful and always willing to assist and give advice when needed. It is definitely a team-spirited environment,","The innovative spirit no longer exists as it once did. The goals and projects are all aligned with perception in the cloud market, where there hasn't been much focus on IBM creating its own new frontier. To this, competitors are able to take advantage of this opportunity by offering better compensation packages and more interesting projects to work on. Although, you are at the mercy of the decisions made by leadership with respect to how the company grows in relation to the market and competitors. The biggest con is going from a cloud leader to not being in the BIG three anymore where pride has taken a hit, especially if you were in it from the start.

- Risk adverse. IBM prefers to buy instead of build their own. I've witnessed first hand a business proposal for a new amazing idea (containizeration in its earliest days - before Kubernetes existed) get rejected. IBM purchased Red Hat to catchup vs. take the risk internally to develop the idea. Many other examples similar to this observed over the years.

Kissing bottom is taken to an art form and there are more angles on everything you say and do than a billiards game."
Digital design engineer,4.0,"Oct 23, 2009",Former employee,"IBM is extremely progressive in work/life balance.  You can work at home pretty much whenever you want/need to.  The number of sick days is unlimited.  There are no timesheets to fill out for most professional workers.  Some employees work part time, and parental leave is up to 3 years (unpaid).  There is paid parental leave:  6 weeks for new moms, and 2 weeks for new dads.  Overall, coworkers are very helpful and willing to go out of their way to help you.","Long hours tend to be the norm at this company, and some people burn out.  The downside to working at home is that sometimes you are expected to be constantly connected.  There is a lot of schedule-driven quality (i.e. the schedule is king, and quality falls by the wayside).  Worst of all, IBM has very strict transfer rules.  You can only transfer to another department with your manager's approval, and sometimes they don't give it.  I wanted to transfer from digital design to hardware simulation, and even though the new department knew me very well and wanted me, the process took over 1 year."
Senior product manager,2.0,"Apr 11, 2015","Former employee, more than 10 years","The opportunity for worldwide travel. The ability to have multiple jobs without leaving a company. This is both good and bad. You'll work with some of the smartest people in the world. Flexibl work schedules. Medical dental 401k. Loads of discounts for personal use including hotels, car rental and financing, electronics, cell phone service, entertainment and many many more. Continuing education. Financial advice, maternity kits including breast pump, books and guides. Great place for a first job. The perks are too numerous to name. You just have to know about them and hope your manager does too.","Because IBM has products in so many areas, it has many competitors which means you often get stuck using IBM products instead of the best products to get your job done. No investment in its own infrastructure so it can react quickly. E.g. Archaic financial systems. I don't recommend staying with this company longer than 2 years if you have been acquired, after that you lose your sales force and the team of whichever native IBM solution is comparable to yours will start to make life difficult. Pay is not great. Except very small raises and smaller to no bonuses as a top contributor."
Security technical specialist,5.0,"Feb 10, 2016","Current employee, more than 1 year","Great Company, Benefits, Team Members, and a chance to learn from a vast number of technologies and excel in many ways whether be it personally and or professionally. There is an abundance of resources and sometimes way too much to sift through, but non-the-less there is information about everything and anything you want to know, learn to better understand and deliver. Great place to be in and a chance to travel around, abroad, move up or parallel, meet people from around the world, and sometime literally, participate in events, conventions conferences, make a difference, make an impact not only within IBM, but within other companies, and even on a global scale. ""Who said that Elephants can't dance"" IBM is leading the way for future generations and companies as well.","With Big companies, you tend to spin your wheels a little, and management will assist and help, but moving up sometimes is slow, raises are almost a rarity and sometimes frustrating. 
Best thing is to Love what you do and you wouldn't mind the minimum raise. Persevere and you'll move up, move around, or move out! Very High Demand on meeting quotas (if you are in sales or technical sales)"
Software engineer,3.0,"Mar 27, 2021","Former employee, more than 3 years","- IBM has a very open and accepting culture. Everyone there is really nice and usually easy to work with.
- Good work life balance. Being out of the office for appointments, children's events, mental health, etc. is very well supported and encouraged.
- Some of the projects are cool, and it's rewarding knowing that many people depend on the software you work on.","- I couldn't tell you how many people there are that do literally nothing and never get fired. It is infuriating feeling like you could do the same and it wouldn't matter.
- Some very talented people work here, but at the same time, many incredibly un-talented people do too which ruins the company's/team's progress.
- The pay isn't competitive. IBM will always lose it's best talent to companies with better pay, benefits, and less red tape.
- Deadlines are a mess. I'm surprised customers continue to use IBM products at times given the outages and issues that occur so frequently at the end of every quarter.
- Designing for the customer gets lost in the complexity of IBM's systems. There are so many features that seem good on paper, but are really hard to use/missing functionality that a customer actually needs.
- No one will advocate for you in your career progression - you must do so yourself."

Program manager,3.0,"Sep 8, 2008",Former employee,"Great company reputation.  Lots of different lines of business to move between over the course of a career.  Pretty good as far as work life balancing, especially in terms of coming up with flexible working arrangements for people with differing needs (e.g, work from home).  The stock purchase plan was pretty generous in terms of the discount versus the market.  There were always a lot of training opportunities available.  There are a lot of smart people especially in highly technical parts of the company, but the business side functions were weaker in comparison.  IBM still does offer the opportunity (though no longer the guarantee) of long term tenured employment.","Career pathing is very nebulous outside of Global Services.  Expect a slow, slow progression in your career track even if you are a strong performer.  Company is pretty conservative and not very entrepreniurial.  Managers weren't always well trained in career coaching and development skills for employees.  Although they are clear that 'you own your career', sometimes it felt more like an excuse not to have well defined career tracks instead of really empowering employees.  There were not a lot of opportunities to network with other groups in the company which also made it more difficult to take advantage of the size of the company in terms of growth opportunities.  Salaries are OK, but don't expect much in the way of incentive compensation or substantially better pay for high performance."
Project manager,3.0,"Feb 2, 2009",Current employee,"Excellent people to work with.  Good benefits, 401K match, managers are generally good about vacation.  There are opportunities for career growth, but one must make it one of your goals to advance.  The problem is people are so busy working, they don't spend time on planning their own career.  Another positive in IBM are the opportunities to work on patents.  Generally speaking, I found colleagues are bright and industrious.  But it's not a place for slackers.","Just like anyplace, there are some good managers and some bad managers.  Good managers open to improving the way things work, not just the way things look on a chart.  Good managers also try to develop their staff and help them advance their career interests.  Bad managers often look out for themselves, not for the staff.  They will pressure people to make unrealistic goals; do not plan well and then work everyone into the ground when the plan is broken.  Careerwise it seems to take a long time to advance unless you have been at the right place, or connect with the right people.  But that's true everywhere."
Anonymous employee,4.0,"Apr 10, 2010",Current employee,"Flexibility is great.
Work from home.
Benefits are pretty good overall.
No micro-management (this, of course, depends on division/organization and employee's skills/performance).
Annual salary reviews (depending on your performance review, you get an increase, I have always gotten an increase every single year, but in recent years that increase is about 2-3% only).
Annual performance bonus.","Base salary paid is a little lower than other top companies in the Austin area.
Off-shoring like crazy... too many folks here in the states are getting displaced by employees and/or contractors overseas.
There's smart people anywhere in the world... but it seems that in many cases IBM just hires ""global resources"" without conducting a good technical interview.... and what happens next is just horrible... you, as the person facing management here in the US, then have to deal with these folks who lack technical skills and you are asked to make it work...
If you are a good and excellent software engineer, you are rewarded like this: you become the lead of some ""global team"" and you are left with very little time to own a component since you have to spend a lot of time on communication: many global resources do not speak English and/or lack many technical skills (sometimes the need to do baby-sitting is just too much)."
Graphic designer,1.0,"Jul 10, 2016","Former employee, less than 1 year","- Flexible work from home option (or anywhere there's a WiFi connection)
- Freedom. Often your Managers are in remote locations
- Travel (if you like that) Sometimes in interesting cities. Accommodations are nice
- Benefits are decent but declining
- Recognizable name on resume","- Impersonal. You are literally a number. You are assigned a serial# on day 1 and this becomes your identity within the company
- Difficult to form relationships with colleagues. There was a complete lack of camaraderie, which fostered competition within my own team and other divisions
- Antiquated internal systems. (i.e. filling out Excel spreadsheets for job tracking purposes)
- Incompetent Managers who knew nothing of the creative process and like to play office politics, favorites and are extremely bureaucratic. Conform to the IBM way and do not speak the truth
- Expectation of 24/7 availability including weekends to meet unrealistic demands and short deadlines without any incentive
- IBM = I'm By Myself. You are your own HR, Admin, Travel Agent, Security and Office Manager and so on
- Have a question? Good luck navigating W3 (IBM's cumbersome intranet) to find answers to the simplest things
- Some office locations are deplorable. My specific mobile location was something straight out of the 80's. No perks. Not even a break room
- Their idea of training and skill growth was watching online videos, of which you are required to complete 40hrs a year on your own time
- Low morale due to constant lay-offs (or Resource Actions) and a sickening severance package of 1 month no matter how many years you dedicated your life and career with IBM

Overall, working for IBM was the worst job experience of my 15+ career as a Graphic Designer.

Your own experience will vary widely depending on the division, your managers and your working environment preferences."

-First/second even 3rd line managers no longer have any decision making ability. 
-The forecasting process is non stop - with more time spent forecasting and presenting sales forecasts to multiple mgrs/levels than actual selling. 
-Raises are almost non-existent and usually only 1-2%. 
-Benefits have continued to decline with healthcare contributions continuing to decrease and employee costs skyrocketing. 
-There is no longer a pension plan, the 401k match happens once a year, in January. So most silent layoffs happen in 4th qtr. 
-30 day severance is the new policy whether you have 1 year of service or 40. 

Overall company environment has gone from poor to absolutely toxic. Many of those who remain are looking to leave or actively doing so.

Anonymous employee,3.0,"Jan 30, 2017","Current employee, less than 1 year","Some of the smartest minds I have ever come in contact with, working on some technology that has, is and will continue to change the world in ways many of us don't understand.  IBM is quietly behind the scenes of so many of mankinds' biggest breakthroughs and businesses that power our economy.  To have a hand in developing and delivering this thinking and these technologies to market is an incredibly exciting opportunity.","The organization is at times, too smart for its own good.  They prefer slow and perfect over agile and testing and learning.  It is a culture that tends to avoid risk taking, with a rule and process to follow for EVERYTHING - sometimes, multiple conflicting rules for the same process.  IBM is interesting also in the sense that what makes it such a successful and valuable company (the tech intelligence/pure brilliance of its people), is what hurts it when it comes to bringing its cutting edge ""stuff"" to market.  IBM has a problem translating smart tech jargon into language that clients can understand in terms that address their needs.  We lead with tech, while others like Accenture, lead with problem solving and understanding the client first."
User experience designer,5.0,"Jul 17, 2018","Former employee, more than 1 year","At the time of my employment, IBM was providing a 3-month bootcamp for new hires, where they essentially walk you through how to design for an enterprise company. I felt extremely fortunate to have started my professional career with this program, as it taught you how to collaborate, organize, present, and execute outside of a college context. 

IBM's Design program also cares deeply about company culture, and hire people that I found to be some of the best to work with in my professional career. They understand that the ability to collaborate is far more important than talent alone.

Additionally, I found extensive room to grow during my career at IBM. My boss allowed us to create our own programs, such as ""learning sessions"" to learn, for example, Github from our front end dev, and attend conferences. Teammates who stayed on after I left were also promoted to leads to reward their growth and contributions. If you find the right team within the company, the opportunities were invaluable.","Retention. Unfortunately, the structure of this bootcamp led to lofty expectations of work environments outside of the Austin office. I gave such a high rating because I personally was very fortunate to be part of a great product we have a lot of personal control in, and saw through from research to launch. However, it really comes down to the team and the office location. The design program is large, and every experience I've heard has varied greatly, along with how long they stayed on at IBM."
Manager,2.0,"Mar 7, 2019","Current employee, more than 3 years","I am surrounded by good people who know how to deliver high quality software.

They will definitely lay off huge swaths of people at the drop of a hat. Considering that they don't seem to have much mastery in developing worthwhile products, you would be well-served by keeping some money liquid in the event of a layoff. 

Hilariously, *every* piece of software that we use internally is worst in class, including IBM's own products. Every process is ill-defined and difficult to navigate. Knowledge is not shared except through social networks.

There seems to be opportunities for software engineers to move around internally (discovered after layoffs), but I have yet to find anyone who was happy with their move. Opportunities for managers are nearly non-existent.

The benefits are terrible. I hired someone and was able to give him a sizable increase, which he lost (and then some) when he had to pay for health benefits."

Little higher than average pay","Senior managment and VPs are VERY out of touch with the average worker.  They have no clue about the repurcussions of their actions down the chain, and they don't care to learn either.

IBM operates like it is on the verge of bankruptcy.  Expenses, resources, and test budgets have been cut to the bone.  Now they are drilling for the marrow.

Almost impossible to back-fill contractor team positions.  IBM refuses to pay contractors what they are worth so turn over is high.  How can I keep contractors on my team when IBM pays 14-18$ an hour and right down the road Cisco, Red Hat, NetApp and Nvidia are paying entry level contractors 23-28$ an hour?

Old times are very smart people (can't say the same about the new people being hired at band 9 or higher)","I didn't see us adding any real value to our clients, I got the feeling that a lot of poorly repackaged material, full of buzzwords, was circulated as new ICAP. Although this is standard in consulting, it seemed far worse here than elsewhere. 

I noticed a high turnover rate. New people (APs, Architects etc) coming in, want to immediately impress their managers and I saw a lot of them taking credit for other employees' contribution 

There is an insane focus on Utilization...IBM wants close to 100% of your time being billed to a client. This leaves very little time for employee development and training since you're working 50-60hrs a week on projects. 

There's a process for everything. If you haven't been with IBM for a while, it's impossible to figure it out without some handholding (which isn't easy to get). 

Often feel like you're operating in a void (to be fair this depends on your manager)

Since that is changing (i.e. ""co-location""), I can not think of another reason to remain.  I like my work, but not my job. There is a big difference.","There is an ongoing level of chaos at IBM that is toxic. At times, it can seem exciting and it gets spun that way (new strategy! new products! new org structure!) until you realize that it never ends. Never. Ever. Then it is just exhausting. Additionally, the top-down mandates keep coming, demanding more and more from fewer and fewer. Also exhausting. Meanwhile, benefits and pay are no longer competitive and they continue to diminish except for the precious few who are in the upper echelons. They tend to be the same people issuing the mandates."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"May 9, 2017","Current employee, more than 10 years","Work at home (though rapidly disappearing), some select areas of genuine innovation and distinction. For now, relatively strong brand. Pretty solid employee benefits, but few perks.","IBM is an inward-looking organization, and a slow-moving one but with a few fast-moving areas. Every quarter the message from leadership is, ""We fell short overall, but our positive results in x, y, or z show that our transformation strategy is working. We all must execute better going forward."" Lay offs follow and it's up to the survivors (increasingly hardened operators) to spin even more plates, or appear to, before the axe falls again. IBM spent over a billion dollars last year buying its own stock to keep the price up, and laid off tens of thousands as part of that winning strategy. It's been doing this for many years.

In my experience, every year the volatility and toxicity of the environment grows. Top and bottom performers get smart and leave or are laid off, and what's left are the very senior IBMers and a vast middle management culture, though at this stage the wolf at the door is starting to eat them too. I guess that's the IBM version of ""Scrum"" and ""Agile"" (though teams of competing IBM experts would want to argue with me on my use of terms--may the expert with the best positioned senior director win).

My advice: work for a different company, one that cares about its employees' careers and isn't playing a vast and very long shell game."

The constant layoffs create a specter of uncertainty therefore employees are regularly grooming their resumes and looking for other opportunities (hence you lose the best employees).

If you feel like you've hit diminishing returns in Product Management, you can get into Sales, Strategy, M&A, Partnership, Development, etc, if you work at it a bit.","- IBM is a big company, 300K+ employees world-wide. Parts of IBM are extremely well managed and up-to-date, with healthy cultures, others have awful outdated processes, terrible cultures, or management that lead through fear instead of intelligence. As a candidate, you need to scrutinize who you would be working for, the culture of the team, how it and you are measured. It is not worth working for a bad part of IBM.
- Diversity could be better. A lot of great improvement over the last few years, but more work required."

Anonymous employee,4.0,"Sep 28, 2008",Current employee,"Environment of constant change and complexity, particularly due to IBM's global focus.  Good management with opportunities for advancement.  Also, increasing flexibility in work location (telecommuting, etc.)  Work projects are often very challenging, so being bored is never an option.  On the other hand, getting major initiatives supported and off the ground can take a seeming act of God, so patience and persistence is not only a virtue, it's absolutely required.  Leadership often provides good communication from the top down, particularly as IBM embraces the social media to get the messages out to an increasingly distributed troops.  But individual initiative is still key for personal growth.","Global exposure can often mean regular 12 hour days.  Complexity of business environment (matrixed organization) can mean lack of clear direction and focus, leading to a consistent sense of being overwhelmed.  Despite all the focus on communication from top leadership, due to the complex nature of the business one will find often competing goals and objectives within the organization, so an understanding of the ambiguous operating environment can either frustrate or foment, depending on the individual response.  The long days can become overwhelming, so the employee needs to know when they should turn off the Blackberry/ThinkPad -- IBM will take all that you can give them."
Advisory software engineer,3.0,"Dec 20, 2008",Current employee,"- Job flexibility. If you are determined to excel in your position then a world of options are opened to you. The complexity and far reaching nature of the company allows one to gain expertise that isn't even a part of their job description.  If done right, one can mold their career and create a position suited for themselves.  
- Technology. If you are in a development/test role then you have access to just about all hardware/software available. Any OS, programming language, tape drive, hard drive tech, networking infrastructure.. etc... is there. 
- Benefits.  Compared to many other companies, the benefits (medical, 401k, options....) are among the top.","The major down-side is definitely work/life balance. Although IBM advertises a great balance, you'll only find this being used by those whose roles are not essential. Any valued leader will find themselves faced with understanding the big picture. This applies to the matrixed organization, product design, team dynamics, market direction, and even client satisfaction. Due to the large nature of the company, understanding and working with the previously mentioned aspects takes much time... more than 8 hours in a day.  There are many within the company that simply do not go this far in their understanding and their work/life balance is probably great... however it places a burden on others in charge who have to make up for their shortcomings."
It specialist,4.0,"Apr 27, 2010",Former employee,Most of the people are really nice and hardworking.  The company has a good reputation.  Excellent with EEO.  Often very flexible with work hours.  Compensation is competitive and benefits are good.,"As a general rule, you will be expected to work at least 50 hours a week and do give back in addition to your normal work hours. This is to meet productivity goals and must be done even in slow times.  (Giveback is good, it you had the time to do it)  The job is not secure.  Periodically IBM does massive layoffs.  It doesn't matter if you are on the bench or have a revenue producing assignment,  if you are in the wrong group at the wrong time, you will be laid off."
Software engineer,2.0,"Aug 29, 2010",Current employee,"Lab is quiet and remote. Flexible working hours, working from home. IBM's external recognition is still somewhat good, so it has some value on a resume. If you are starting fresh from school, it can be a good place to learn and gain some experience. Decent benefits. Many locations around the world for relocation.","A lot. Low pay, no transparency at all about company decisions, bureaucracy at its best. It has to be the workplace in the world with most meetings per capita, where most of the workforce career goal is to to reach some (people or project) management position. The quality of the technical workforce as been aggressively depreciating with the top performers regularly leaving as they cannot stand the management hypocrisy and all the politics anymore. As a result, IBM is today one of the last places where recent grads and tech workers apply for jobs in the Bay Area. Most of the fresh-out-of-school hires come from San Jose State Univ, as IBM cannot capture the interest of students from top schools. This then reflects in the lower quality of work and software development practices. Definitely not a place to stay long after you get your first 2-3 years of experience, unless your goal is to be in management."
Program director,3.0,"Aug 19, 2015","Former employee, more than 5 years","Brand value, resources, flexibility, ability to work from home. Plenty of smart people and perhaps a good place to learn how big companies approach problems and operate on a global scale. Great for technical people who prefer extremely well-defined roles where every process and procedure is already laid out.","Aging, stodgy, painfully slow promotion schedule, endless career ladder, and almost everyone's a lifer. This makes the environment incredibly myopic, political, and people are expected to stay well within their tightly defined roles and position on the totem pole. Workloads and expectations are high, and it's the kind of place where it's ok (and expected) for managers to regularly ream their hardworking staff the slightest typo, shortcoming, oversight, etc. As a result, people often fear their managers, who fear their managers, and so on."
Sales leader,2.0,"Mar 28, 2022","Former employee, more than 10 years","Remote work, for the most part a very ethical company (but google dinobabies), committed to diversity and LGBTQ, adequate pay and benefits, some products are good. Rank and file are good people. Good work life balance and for the most part managers care about their people.","Micromanagement to the extreme, very little sales manager empowerment, unreasonably focused on metrics and pipeline over actual performance, commitment to many product lines is virtually non existent, too much sales generalization - the expectation is that you may sell dozens or hundreds of unrelated products. Constant territory churn, horrible CRM that is simply used for forecasting and not working with clients. Huge emphasis on ""cadence"" where everyone has to spend hours each week reviewing deals and next steps with execs. Horrible lead generation and marketing in general.

We could not retain many young successful sellers who were constantly being hired off by more agile and focused competitors with better cultures. Sales can be a tough job and IBM's micromanaging sales culture makes it worse.

IBM is not a bad place to work but could be so much better by modernizing it's sales culture. I would be cautious to recommend this as a place to work. Depending upon your situation it might be great, or not so much."

Intern,3.0,"Jun 24, 2008",Former employee,"I can't say anything about the other areas of the company, but the research division (where I was working) had a very laid-back, academic atmosphere. The research staff members I worked with had a ton of freedom in setting their agendas, choosing what kind of papers to publish, etc. and seemed quite happy overall with their jobs. Lots of opportunities to collaborate with people inside and outside the company; many were involved in projects with Stanford, Berkeley, UCSC, and other universities in the area.","First, the bureaucracy was horrible, worse than I ever could have imagined. It took me almost two months to get my first paycheck because someone entered my address incorrectly into the payroll system. Nothing is handled locally- you have to call some faraway place to get help, going through layers and layers of people who are either incompetent or uncaring. I had the same problem with the IT support- I couldn't get into my email and was forced to spend 2 hours on the phone with a poorly trained, unintelligible support guy in India until I could finally talk to someone who was able to fix my problem.

Second, the workplace had some serious deficiencies. The onsite cafeteria served nasty, low quality, unhealthy, overpriced food. The ""gym"" was about the size of a broom closet and had only two machines. These and other things made me feel that the company didn't care about the happiness of its employees and was willing to cut perks for the short-sighted objective of reducing costs."
Senior software engineer,3.0,"Dec 5, 2008",Current employee,"If you find a position right for you on a team that is in one of IBM's core businesses, you'll probably be happy.  There are lots of good people in ""Big Blue,"" some of which are extremely well connected in global terms, opening doors to potential opportunities.  Strong work and leadership are likely to be recognized and leveraged and, in time, rewarded.  Size and stability can raise security, which is especially useful for people with families or other long term responsibilities.  There are a broad range of businesses and roles, lateral moves into areas of preference or growth are quite possible.","The company is a behemoth, and with large scale comes processes and cold impersonality - its unavoidable.   The company had laudable policies re ""people first"" and compensation, much of that has gone away.  If you're outside the mainstream business, you'll likely be struggling for resources and the attention of policy makers.  Much of the internal technology si not competitive with what we find on the internet, and this is an unfortunate burden for the company.  Opportunities are subject to the usual competition, do not go to IBM expecting to be a software architect without proving yourself for a decade or more of dues against a bunch of talented others."
Senior managing consultant,3.0,"Sep 13, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Compared to other IT consulting companies, the culture is pragmatic and focused on delivering the right thing for the client. IBM is obviously huge, so it is what you make it. You'll work with very diverse teams. Some teams will be great, others will be poor. If you are willing to put in 60-70 hour weeks doing 40+ of client delivery and 20+ of business development and figuring out how to navigate the internal processes, you'll do great and get promotions and advance. If you want to work 40-44 hours a week just doing client work, you'll have a secure job, but don't expect a raise no matter how stellar your performance is at the client site.","Business development and proposal process is a mess, and you seemingly reinvent the wheel every time. 
It's easier to get a new job than get on a new project (this is really just for Public Sector GBS). 
You have to fight to make your own career happen, no one else is actually looking out for you. It's your job to write your own project performance evaluations, write the case to apply for a promotion and at the end of the day there are really just 2 numbers that matter most: billable utilization %, and dollars of sales wins."
Summit program,5.0,"Sep 15, 2016",Current employee,"The IBM Summit Program hired me (along with several hundred other millennials) for an intensive 6 month sales training course.  The program includes guidance and interaction with people from varying branches of the company.  Early on, a social culture with an emphasis on networking, teamwork, and problem solving was established.  In the first learning lab, we were pushed to make a series of mock sales calls.  We received constructive feedback from the sales advisors and our peers and then proceeded to watch and critique our fellow trainees as they made calls.  It was one of the most productive learning exercises that I have ever been a part of... and I used to be a teacher.  This company offers a wide range of opportunities in a variety of areas.  I came in with an open mind and willingness to learn.  It is a great place to be if you are open to constantly learning and adapting.","It is a very self-paced program.  Some people choose to sit in the back row in the literal and figurative sense as opportunities pass them by.  If you are highly intrinsically motivated and are interested in a culture of constant growth, this may be a good fit for you."

I was able to take classes to expand my skills, go to conferences, and ""flex out"" for excessive overtime.  The best thing about IBM was definitely the people I worked with - these were the most hardworking, intelligent, creative thinking people I have ever met.  These employees were truly cream of the crop.  Unfortunately, times have changed, and most of the benefits I initially saw with IBM are long gone, and I don't believe it will get any better.","I had absolutely no job security, very few raises, and you were expected to work enough hours and overtime time make up for any vacation, sick leave, or other time off - plus an additional percentage.  Funding for education seems to have been frozen for the past 4 years, so forget about any classes unless they are free and downloadable... and taken in whatever spare time you can find.  Any compliments about a job well done were followed with expectations of more, no matter how impossible.  All in all, the last five years my quality of life dropped substantially, and my morale was at an all time low, a sentiment shared with many co-workers.  2009 brought the ax down on many of these wonderful hardworking people - and these people will go to competitors."

They still allow employees to work from home in some jobs and that can be a real plus if you don't have to travel a lot.  They have some promising technologies if they can bring them to market cost effectively.","What haven't they taken away?

Software engineer,3.0,"Dec 18, 2015","Former employee, more than 1 year","I had great, smart, experienced engineers on my team--everyone was a great teammate. Mine was one of the few dev teams at the company that got to use Macbooks instead of Thinkpads. Most of my coworkers had spouses and children and the company really cares about work-life balance: they paid us well in salary and benefits, and didn't expect us to live and breathe work all the time. I had the flexibility to leave during the day and/or work from home when I needed to.","I felt very out of place as a new grad; there were plenty of designers my age in the next building over, but very few young engineers. That's not necessarily a bad thing since my older coworkers were very experienced and had a lot to teach me. I was unhappy because of the day-to-day bureaucracy and how set in their ways the managers of my team seemed to be. Meetings were 30-60 minute conference calls every day. Individual offices are great for senior developers but personally, as a fresh-out-of-school developer, I felt isolated and depressed in my cold, windowless office. I would recommend this company to a person who is at least 35, but not to any of my friends who are my age."
Anonymous employee,3.0,"Sep 30, 2016",Former employee,"Flexibility in working hours is amazing, awesome work/life balance; that might change a little as I heard they are requiring some co-location. If you proactively manage your career & skill development, you can laterally move across jobs roles and positions. Complete some large projects, and move on to other areas, do not stay in one position for too long. 

401k benefits are great; large selection of investment options. ESPP is available. Benefits as a whole is comparable to other IT companies. Health benefits not as competitive for families though.

Globally integrated employees allows you to interact and experience many different cultures; it is a great learning experience and development for entry level workers.

Lots of opportunities in the growth areas of the business (Cognitive, Security).

Great place for Millennials & Generation Z to gain Enterprise experience for 3-5 years.","Healthcare benefits can be very expensive for families. 

Limited quality training and education; IBM offers many 'free' online courses and training, but quality training is minimal. You need to be highly proactive in keeping skills updated sometimes w/o a clear understanding of the business priorities to align your skill set.

Language barrier with a globally integrated company; it can be difficult sometimes to be highly productive. 

Certain divisions are not growing and generating revenue; management makes decision based on the best interest of the business without regard for their employee skill set.

Average 15-25 employees per manager; manager interaction can be very limited with career progression constrained."

Morale is very low.  My comment in the pros section is when an employee starts.  After the first project the employee basically understands that IBM would trade them for a dog if the dog could write code or architect a solution.
Watson is a myth.  It is not ready for prime time and IBM is marketing cognitive like there are not limits.  I'm sure someday IBM will market 'cognitive' toilet paper."
Data center facilities manager,5.0,"Feb 22, 2022","Current employee, more than 8 years","IBM was a fantastic place to work, with a great work-life balance. My management and leadership were always tremendously supportive and recognized the contributions of the team. I enjoyed my time there. I was outsourced with a change in corporate strategy which led to a spin-off of their GTS division to Kyndryl.","Raises and bonuses were meager, though the compensation and benefits for everyone was fair. The only way to get significant raises there was through promotion, which I was fortunate to have achieved. Unfortunately, this could not be the case for everyone.

As it was a mature company with no growth in that segment, we were all just waiting for people to retire so we could clamor for their jobs. Many times those promotional opportunities evaporated when the organization restructured to eliminate the job after their retirement. 

The end result was that promising young engineers with other opportunities left the company. People with little other opportunity or high risk aversion stayed around, and company performance continued to slow.

Many times the corporate culture and process were extremely bureaucratic and focused on cost-cutting to the long term detriment of morale and business agility. The company continued to centralize so much spending authority to finance over the years that it became very difficult to maintain the facilities, which ended up deteriorating."

Lots of intelligent managers with valuable experience. Excellent top-notch benefits (401k and health insurance arguably the best, as well as free financial adviser). IBM name commands respect on your resume. Flexible work schedules.","Annual raises are poor whereas new-hire starting salaries are superb. It's highly likely that new-hires will start the year after you, or 2 years after you, with higher, or very similar salaries to yours, including your raises--even if you get outstanding performance reviews year after year. It seems there is more effort spent on acquiring new talent versus keeping and rewarding existing talent. This discourages existing talent from staying for any length of time, or continuing to strive for excellence year after year. An excellent performance review doesn't mean anything if it isn't backed up with financial reward. It just helps my resume look more attractive to recruiters elsewhere.

Also the company laptop situation is poor. On starting day you receive a used, refurbished laptop which is supposed to last you 4 years. That would be fine if you weren't also forced to use it for such basic things like checking email and billing hours--why can't I do these things on my own laptop/tablet/smartphone?

If you're a technical person, there is a path for that and most of the management team is happy to have people that have good quality technical skills. There are some select projects that are still good to be on.","I also know a lot of smart people who have left the company. Bonuses for the most part are gone. Raises, non-existent. The constant threat of getting caught up in a resource action. A lot of people are often double booked (depending on the project you work on) and those who are smart enough to go, often do when they realize that the peaks and valleys of a project have now just become constant peaks with the expectation that you are available all the time.

That's when they bring in 2 contractors for the work of one person and then dump one of you after 2 weeks after they decide which one of you they like better. A lot of looking over your shoulder if you're not connected to some one in mgmt. More emphasis on what your ""special project"" looks like on paper and not what you do day to day. In tens years, ten managers only one who provided and sort of support or guidance. Very stressful once you know the score. Not loyalty anywhere and to anyone. Purely dog eat dog.

As IBM is really banking on AI to pull itself into the future, you will be exposed lots of AI techologies like NLP, computer vision, some element of creating models for classification and prediction.

The DC office is on F and 14th so very conveniently located one block from metro center.","The mentorship opportunities are little to none. Everyone who has the technical competence to be a mentor is overworked and overstressed, and you can only really get them to spend time with you if you happen to be on the same project. I have been on several projects where I, with less than one year of experience, have been the lead on a project simply because everyone else is too expensive or unavailable.

While you are exposed to these AI technologies, it is unlikely you actually get to work with them hands on. Most AI in our projects depends on Watson APIs (whose accuracy is definitely not cutting edge), so you're mostly making API calls rather than building a model yourself, so there's little opportunity to gain experience or understanding.

A lot of the projects they deliver to the client also often have pretty low usability because we are severely lacking in front end engineers and rarely talk to the Design team because they're too expensive."

User Research  is still not recognized as its own independent discipline and rather considered a specialty under design. If you are a User Researcher and considering joining IBM. Be prepared to constantly be called a ""Designer"". Be prepared to not be included in many conversations and decision making efforts because many still don't understand what user  research is or how it can help other than concept testing. Be prepared to be told what to do by the design discipline because ux designers and user researchers don't have equal seats at the table... you will not have a easy time. You will not feel fulfilled unless you luck out and have a team that somehow has established a better process than the rest. You will have a difficult time growing your career here as a User Researcher. You will have a very difficult time recruiting participants, you will be micromanaged, ignored, etc.) You will witness UX Designers get promoted and awarded and applauded frequently while you feel stuck... bored.... stressed.... overworked.... fatigued.... unmotivated.....depressed"

Ww marketing manager,4.0,"Jul 18, 2008",Current employee,"Work/life balance is excellent.  IBM has a large mobile workforce and its very common to handle all of your work, calls, etc. all from the comfort of your home office.  Showers are optional.  Large company allows you to work for a new 'company' with every job change. So for example, you can work in one role for 2 or 3 years, then take on a new opportunity and you will feel like you are starting with a new company all over again.  New names, new issues but you keep all your benefits.  Pockets of the company have excellent, intelligent people.","Very centralized management team.  You have to be here for 20 years to become an executive with a VP title.  IBM has a lot of internal 'grow your career' materials and systems, processes.  But at the end of the day it's who you know.  If you are well networked, you might advance but IBM's culture only allows for 20 year veterans to take on VP titles.  And just because you 'survived' for 20 years doesnt mean you deserve a turn driving the ship.  There are often far more qualified middle managers and non-managers who would be more effective executives as they are closer to the business."
Senior development engineer,1.0,"Nov 29, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","All the positives of working at IBM are in the rear view mirror.

If you are an executive who gets stock options then IBM is a great company to work for.  You don't have to worry about growing the business.  No matter how bad the business performs IBM will keep your options afloat by buying back Billions in stock.   

If you just draw a salary, maybe you should look elsewhere.","IBM thinks that paying 90% of the midpoint of the market range for a position is competitive.  If IBM wants to only hire people 45th percentile then maybe so.   There are no raises for anyone making more than 45% of the range.  If you are well above average and contribute value that is well above average then why would you settle for having your salary capped a a level that is below average? 

Employees are discouraged, stressed, broken, frightened and afraid.  Mass layoffs, over and over and over have decimated their ranks and destroyed all trust in management and in managements ability to run the business.   

Every year IBM increases the cost of benefits to the employees but salaries never seem to keep up.  

IBM's hardware business is imploding and the executives are clueless.  But if we use social media and Tweet and Like about how great IBM is maybe things will get better.  :-(

Turnover at IBM is very high and the number of people who know how to get things done keeps deceasing as the brain trust gets fired, retires or decides to leave the mess that IBM has become."

Astonishingly, brand name remains relatively strong, although this may change over the next few years and is certainly no guarantee.","Executive suite very obviously does not care about employees, slashing perks and letting infrastructure languish while paying the CEO massive annual bonuses for horrible market performance. Decisions banning common consulting perks, such as alternate travel, Uber as an approved taxi provider, are taken without employee input and can be reversed, but only after sustained, near-universal outcries, and marked increases in attrition. Cool ideas out of Research division and Watson are brought to market before they're ready for enterprise application, and very basic MBA1 management ideas that would improve the company are rushed or diluted to death.

Tone-deaf evaluation system, often approved by entrenched management with little incentive to provide accurate feedback and no useful answers for very basic career development questions, such as ""how do I improve for the next evaluation cycle?""

Entrenched management: without an up or out policy, there is incredible stagnation around the engagement manager level, where talent is particularly thin. Technical skills in basic software, such as Excel and Powerpoint, is incredibly limited at these levels, leading to dumb questions and poor estimates for delivery timeframes.

Generally speaking, good talent finds its way out, and bad talent falls upward, resulting in very, very spotty talent throughout."

2. High probability of getting stuck with a manager who does not care for you or the company.

If you get visibility and perform well early on in your career then you can get fast tracked for your entire career!  You'll almost always get more opportunities than people not on the fast track and be able to fail repeatedly without much consequences.","People on fast trackers must never say no to an idea.  Often management has brought you an opportunity they think will help your career, rejecting it implicitly means you are rejecting their help and you will be punished for it.  
People not on the fast track are doomed to middling careers without much growth.
You'll notice a huge gap between software development veterans (20+ years) and younger talent.  This shows that IBM doesn't do a good job of keeping younger people happy as you progress in your career.  The older folks are there because they can't find another job.  The mid-career people are all gone because they realized there is no future except for a few fast trackers at senior, STSM or DE.

There are lots of things to like about the company if you are interested in selling by committee - having 10 plus people, most having different opinions and know very little about the client's needs, on an strategy and tactics conference call. It's the client representative and their manager who holds the quota for the deal. Therefore, it's the client representative and their manager who should be in control the ""going forward plan"" for the deal... and not a gang of 10 bureaucrats.","There are too many people involved in every deal. In my experience, a meeting to establish strategy and assign tactics would be held and people I didn't know would attend. It got so bad that I ultimately started my con calls asking attendees to state their name and what value they offer to winning the deal. If the person on offered their name and some bogus value I asked them to drop the call. Not unexpectedly, I did not win friends or influence many using this tactic. 

Sales teams (in this case, those responsible for proving the technology and winning the deal) must remain small. It's the sales person, their manager and the systems engineer who must take the lead position.

You can work very hard, accomplish a great deal and still be given a bad or average performance rating just because you were not visible enough to the right people or simply because it was your time to take one for the team.

* Work life balance. IBM is a globally integrated organization. It encourages WFH (after the 1st year of stay at IBM). You will be surprised at how addicted one gets to using Sametime for chatting as well as for scheduling meetings.
* Culture. IBM is a very open company. It is a no non-sense company where Senior leadership is very committed to doing the right thing. IBMers have a bias for the right action.","* Compensation. IBM brand is one of the best in the world. As a result, do not expect to be compensated heavily.

Software engineer,3.0,"Apr 1, 2014","Current employee, more than 5 years","Great people. Most everyone is willing to help you come up to speed. Ample time to learn and build  your skills, particularly when coming out of college. It easy to move up if your willing to take some risks and work hard, at least in software group it is.","As a team lead, processes are more than ever to release a product. You count yourself as a full time developer yet meetings, helping the new hires because IBM pretty much only hires those out of college, you find yourself struggling to find time to write code.  

There are many people who are happy putting in there less than 40 which in some ways stagnates the group as a whole. No one is learning anything new, thus just a few key folks end up knowing much and they don't grow because the group is not educating themselves as a whole. I get it, its not a silicon valley company to have that drive but why shouldn't those who work there want to learn and grow themselves?"
Advisory software engineer,2.0,"May 16, 2014","Current employee, more than 3 years",There is a lot of exposure to different industries. Its very easy to have a career at IBM where you can change what you are working on every few years without getting board working on a single project/technology.,"The company is too big for its own good. The company doesn't care about the employee and due to its size takes forever to approve requests for simple things like a notebook or a box of pencils. There are a number of standards that they put in place to ensure all the application have a similar design paradigm means that creativity, exploration, and progression through a fast paced ever changing world is nearly impossible. Its impossible to move up in the company, raises/bonuses are few and far between, No company outings, health care options cost more than any other company I have worked for or heard about. At the end of the day the only things the upper management cares about is whats in their paycheck, the promises made to the stockholders, and they really don't care about you as a person.

On a business note, our customers were also frustrated with the speed at which IBM moved. They need fixed, enhancements etc to compete in their market. Waiting for yearly releases just isn't possible anymore. customers need a more agile release process where they can get releases and change faster and they can put them in place more quickly and efficiently."
Senior consultant,3.0,"Aug 30, 2014","Former employee, more than 5 years",IBM still draws some of the best and brightest. The work can be quite interesting and challenging. And the company offers flexibility in terms of work times and locations (unless you're required to be at a client site).,"There can be a strong feeling of disconnection. You may work with a team that's widely scattered or based elsewhere, and rarely if ever see them. You spend much of your time on conference calls, often at odd hours if you're dealing with colleagues in other parts of the world. Managers range from good to awful. Unfortunately, I encountered more of the ""awful"" than the good. And finally, career growth can be difficult to impossible. Even if you're a top performer, raises are small to non-existent. The company sets targets that never seem to be reached, at least as far as producing income for employees. The shareholders, on the other hand, almost always hear a much rosier story."

High Management churn as I had 14 managers in 18 years and only 2 of those managers are still with the company, Benefits have been cut over the years, Stock purchase plan is poor.

It felt sort of casual but I worked in the research division so this does not reflect the company overall. Also, I felt like I was a part of a team and valued for my work but that I was also allowed to not know something. Almost everything I did and knew was from working there, not from school, because people took the time to teach and explain stuff to me.","I did not feel valued by the company at large, so by upper management above my own manager. I was pigeonholed by one high level manager and deemed invaluable to the company because of this view held by said manager. The research division is full of contractors and supplementals and only PhDs can get permanent positions there. The basic message I received from this is that the company doesn't want to invest in anyone who isn't 100% exactly what they wanted coming in. With that said, there could be groups that align with this viewpoint as well and I just happened to end up in groups that didn't.

Another con, for contractors at least, is that they bullied me during salary negotiations. We agreed on a salary and then when it reached for the final approval, they demanded we lower it by 15%."

I did not read it, but the title is great. There is a saying, ""RAs are family matter"", such as people actually try to make a living and support families while the elephant is stumping around them.

Very bureaucratic and inhuman, people are only resources. If you spend at least 3 years here, you will notice that half of the people you worked with are gone by that time. Extreme amount of talent is let go by the constant RAs. At the same time the company is hiring new people for the same skill set. I have not seen any effort to match existing talents with opportunities. I actually would like to see proactive management of the work force by constant training, re-training, cross-training according to the changing need of the company.

Benefits are getting more and more expensive, compensation is stagnant with zero inflation adjustment.

This year's most important stuff is ""diversity and inclusion"" and giving people lessons about the ""unconscious bias"", but this seems to be an attempt to tap into cheap labor even more. What about professional competency, which itself would include the above already?

Applications developer,4.0,"May 21, 2021","Current employee, more than 1 year","As a current IBM employee, it depresses me sometimes to think back on my past employers and just how many of those workplaces were managed by ""man/woman-children"" who -- more often than not -- let emotion and personal biases control the daily decisions they make. At those places, *genuinely* good ideas by lower-level staff would be ignored 100% of the time if the idea somehow threatens the manager’s brittle ego or even *slightly* increases their workload. These were Tywin Lannister-wannabes I’m talking about – that view their employees as a group of undisciplined children requiring constant supervision, restricting the tiniest of freedoms and establishing authority by reprimanding non-offenses. For these ""control-gestapos"", managing isn't the goal. Coasting through a life of upper-middle class perks and authority (in title only) is their only motivation. They inhibit any and all culture and creativity from a work environment and drain the lifeforce out of their staff. Sirius Black would never have escaped if Azkaban had a swarm of micromanagers flying around in black hoods. I will be honest with you here… I consider each and every single one of these Putin-sympathizing, workplace-tyrants out there actively defiling our country’s workplaces to be my eternal arch-rivals. 

I guess what I’m trying to say here is IBM does a good job of saying “do this thing by the end of the month” and leaving you alone.",You will be constantly losing roles to other IBM-employees who are more qualified because their CV shows they previously worked in a similar role.

However, after my departure I would not recommend working at IBM.","I left to take an opportunity outside of IBM in February of 2022. I had overall great experience working at IBM over my 3 years at the Company. Upon putting in my two weeks I was immediately notified with 1 hour that it would be my last day. 

I had ended the previous fiscal year FY 2021 at 176% of my sales quota. After waiting 6 plus months to receive payment of my commissions I was notified that I would not be compensated for any of the deals that closed in Q4 of FY'21

I was eliminated from the payment sales pool from one of my deals. The IBM team justified that because I was no longer working at the company in FY'22 I did not deserve to be compensated as part of the team. The deal was closed in December of 2021. 

On another deal, again, the IBM team justified that because I no longer work at IBM and I did not sign a quota for FY'22 that I am not entitled to compensation under the FY'21 compensation plan which I did sign.

IBM is notorious for setting up Sales Plans and not compensating its Sales Team in a fair manner. In addition, IBM does not pay on time. IBMer's are still waiting to be compensated for December 2021 commissions."

Better employer value for somewhat unskilled working to gain industry experience, though it can be a commodity environment; lower-level candidates will have more ""advancement"" opportunity.

1. The pay at the Baton Rouge CIC is low comparatively and relatively. I personally worked there for ~3 years, and was still earning under $50k annually as a developer. 

 2. Management is out of touch with the developers. When things don’t go as planned, management fails to take ownership over developers. Overall, management doesn’t care about developers. They only seem to care about developers charging hours to a project so they meet their numbers. These, among other, managerial issues are deeply rooted in the CIC. I have seen similar issues brought up to upper management, and sadly, little or nothing is done to address the issue's root cause. Instead management’s usual solution is to throw the CIC a pizza party or send you cookies to show you that they “care”.

3. I worked on 6 different projects while at the CIC, and only 2 of the 6 were quality. One of the “projects” I was assigned was for RI Dept of Health working as a call center operator scheduling covid tests for kids and teachers. Overall quality of projects is not great."

Every employee is measured on that.  It used to be in the reviews before someone sued them.

Engineer,2.0,"Jul 11, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years","I have had the pleasure of working with some of the most intelligent people that I have ever worked with – true pioneers of the semiconductor art.  I have driven yields in the fab,  negotiated ground rules with the fab, drawn the circuit, drawn the mask set, measured the circuit in the lab, and seen the parts packaged and shipped to create a high profit for the company.  A wonderful experience that I believe cannot be achieved in todays myopic segregated work approach.","I have seen these phenomenally intelligent and driven people quit and get laid off by the scores in accordance with the 2015 roadmap.  The onset of “matrix management” and other fad management procedures cripple the innovative foundations of the microelectronics group.  IBM does not want to “produce” competitive microelectronics anymore.  They are focusing on software and services.  However, I believe that this is still a great company for software engineers, and project managers.  I would warn against IBM for electronic/chemical engineers (USA)."
Anonymous employee,1.0,"Jan 31, 2016",Former employee,"Company name recognition, excellent pay, opportunity for advancement as long as you are not on the resource list","NO job security, sales quotas not attainable any longer because they are not even close to being realistic, products and services are in decline and not even competitive, R&D is almost non existant, and even when you do an excellent job you could still be resourced for no cause"
Anonymous employee,1.0,"May 7, 2016","Former employee, more than 3 years",Was technically a job. Some of the people I worked with were nice.,"I left and doubled my salary. I expect to quadruple my salary within the next 5-10 years. I had an interview with an elite development team and never responded after seeing life outside IBM. 

THERE ARE NO RAISES. THERE ARE NO PROMOTIONS. ""YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A JOB.""

Want a raise? ""You're lucky you HAVE a job."" They paid me around 30,000 despite having a 4 year degree and providing training for the entire office. They ""pay overtime"" on top of this, but overtime is not allowed/never approved. If you are forced to work overtime and complain about it, you will be randomly selected as a poor performer and fired. 

Many North American jobs are going to India / Brazil / Argentina.

Anybody they hire, which they don't actually hire people by the way, are severly undertrained for their position. It's quite literally people off the street. One of the people on my team was a basketball player, for example.

Disagree with illegal practices, i.e. threatening to fire people for not working free overtime? ""If you don't like it, why don't you quit?"" (This is probably why IBMs centers are largely in areas with no job competition).

Somebody sexually harasses you or makes a racist remark so you file a complaint? What a coincidence, you've been selected as one of the North American mass firing targets. Certainly no correlation to the team of lawyers that showed up to plan your firings for weeks!

Coffee is considered a luxury. If you are a ""whiney complainer"" about things like ""Not being paid your legally agreed upon salary"" then they will threaten to take this away. Nothing else is free."

It specialist,1.0,"Jul 16, 2008",Current employee,I really can't think of any.  Maybe the IBM name and reputation but even that is questionable these days.,"Mandatory voluntary overtime.  Basically, you have to work 10% overtime to get a good review.  You need an excellent review to be considered for a raise.  Promotions are given only after a lengthy process of 'proving your worthy' through a ton of paper work and multiple levels of management approvals."
Anonymous employee,2.0,"Oct 2, 2008",Current employee,IBM is probably the best company on earth that has successfully incorporated work/life balance into its business culture. IBM helps the world get a little bit more green by supporting its employees flexible workplace options and thus help reduce consumption of fossil fuels for commuting. IBM for the most part exhibits tolerance towards diversity and different backgrounds and truly incorporates diversity into its business model.,There is very little career prospects or skills growth opportunities once you join at IBM at any given level. New projects and job opportunities are handed to known and safer contacts within the department and there is very little if any cross-departmental hiring (huge silo mentality). It is near impossible to get promoted and very difficult to get reasonable salary increases even if you put in years of your life with hard work and dedication for client success. Constant threat of off-shoring and reorganizing people at the whims and fancies of executives and low-morale of the employees.
Managing consultant,3.0,"May 14, 2009",Former employee,"- Access to vast information resources
- Professional environment
- World-class corporate reputation
- Excellent place to build a foundation en route to a better job","- Zero investment in developing people, for instance, no formal commitment to ongoing training but plenty of pressure on consultants to train and obtain certifications while trying to remain billable
- Contradictory environment in which IBM controls consultants' deployments on engagements but consultants bear the risk of not being utilized
- Awkward, ineffective, and frustrating evaluation system which penalizes consultants for not having evaluations but fails to censure project leaders who fail to provide evaluations
- Growing practice to place timeline over quality
- Compartmentalization of roles and delivery practices making cross-training in another discipline practically impossible and virtually ensuring the diminishment of a consultant's value when practice areas mature or IBM decides to withdraw from that particular business
- A somewhat peculiar corporate culture typified by a ""guilt trip"" work ethic which often leads the leadership to fill their agenda with volumes of special projects of little or no real value. (This may explain why IBM has so many internal systems which seem to do the same thing)."
Software engineer,2.0,"Jun 10, 2013","Current employee, less than 1 year","Work from home was allowed at any time, no questions asked. No hour tracking or anyone making sure I was meeting quotas as long as I was getting my work done.","The team moved slowly, and individually. There was no sense of teamwork or camaraderie, only individuals with tasks. This was exacerbated by the fact that upper management was forcing the departments into Agile, which led to employees used to doing waterfall to simply do waterfall with iterations. Agile was used entirely as an hour tracking tool for the bosses to send angry emails every day based on their pointless charts, which were based on numbers that everyone was making up.

As a 20something, being the only one in a sea of long time employees with the next youngest employee being in their 30s is a bit of a shock. The fact that IBM only hires college hires or internal makes for the young ones to want to leave, and the internals to result in an echo chamber where no one advances the team. To have to use a version control system whose last major update was in 1995 is insane and will scare off any new talent to a more modern company (where modern in this case could be someone using CVS...)."
Software engineer,2.0,"Nov 19, 2013","Current employee, more than 10 years",The flexibility is great. You can work whenever and wherever within reason.  You can work on a variety of technologies and switching jobs within IBM is not very difficult.,"Read the below for details, but in short, stay away, there are just so many other better companies to work for that will offer you better career opportunities, compensation and a humanizing work environment. 

The benefits and compensation are truly average. Every year I have been here they have taken something away from the employees, for example: free coffee, water jugs, pay coffee(yes they took that away), subsidized cafeteria food, team social events, site social events, tennis courts (closed down due to disrepair), employee stock purchasing plan went from 15% deduction to 10%, 401k is not matched but once a year instead of per pay check which for those who don't get it means you can't earn money that you don't have until they pay out at year end....assuming they haven't fired you.  They have had consistent layoffs or selling of technology since 2009 reducing the local site almost 50%.  I understand every company has had to adjust in the current economic climate, but match the above w/ IBMs record Earning Per Share numbers and astronomical revenues and it's a simple formula. Upper management is attempting to meet ludicrous goals at the expense of it's employees."
