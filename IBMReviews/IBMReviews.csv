Anonymous employee,5.0,"Aug 12, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years","Empathetic leadership and an inspiring, organization-wide commitment to improvement.","When role boundaries are unclear, you may be required to handle work outside your expertise—an especially daunting prospect when critical issues demand immediate attention."
Advisory engineer,4.0,"Aug 26, 2014","Current employee, more than 8 years","Disclaimer: A lot of what I'm writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain.  But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 
1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 
2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 
3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.","1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the ""normal distribution"" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being ""average contributors"" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 

2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent ""above average"" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated ""average contributor"" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.

From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 

3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 

4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.  Employees learn from rumors and news websites what's about to come..."
Ibm cloud sales,4.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years","I have truly enjoyed my time working at IBM, especially the training opportunities and benefits provided. It’s a company that invests in its employees and offers great development programs.","Recently, I’ve observed some changes in how roles and compensation are handled. Some senior leaders have been reassigned to lower roles, and there have been salary adjustments, including reductions for those with extensive experience. 

For someone motivated by promotion and salary growth, IBM might not currently be the best place, as the company seems to be focusing on hiring younger talent at lower salaries, while experienced employees are experiencing cuts. Nonetheless, IBM remains a respected company with many strengths, but it's important to be aware of these recent changes."
Customer success manager - architect,3.0,"Jun 16, 2025","Former employee, more than 5 years","Exceptional pay and benefits. Great people, great customers.","- Heavy organizational ""tech debt"" drives down efficiency and job satisfaction. 
- Customer Success is not truly customer success - it's an organization created as a reaction to an inability to deploy products from Enterprise License Agreements. The primary mission of CS at IBM is to identify use cases, sponsors, budget, and gain commitment to deploy software from ELAs. Those are PRE-sale activities, not POST-sale CS activities. Just because an ELA was sold does not mean things are actually post-sale. An ELA is just a contract vehicle to buy something in the future, a gift card sold at a discount, all the normal sales activities still need to happen. 
- Sr. team members are being let go in favor of inexpensive, inexperienced new hires."
Application developer 2,4.0,"Jun 11, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Out the gate, IBM educational material teaches you all about how to be an impactful player as part of an active tech business. You will have reviews of updated material on how to conduct business with others professionally. On a monthly basis you'll have access to C-suite thought leadership statements and chats, and I have even participated in chats where the CEO of the company will voice his opinion on the goings on in tech news as it relates to IBM.

The location selected is a location in WV nearby to where I am employed, as my actual location was not selectable among provided Glassdoor options.","IBM is a big business, and sometimes promotion can seem years away from actualizing due to the changing structure of the company in the big tech boom times we are in. As a young player myself, the desire to self-educate and become more productive with practice and experimentation can sometimes compete with the need to deliver products on a team. I think the company makes it hard sometimes to balance the two, and when you have to do both, you have to work a heavy load of hours to accomplish it all."
Progammer,3.0,"Jun 25, 2025","Current employee, more than 8 years","You will get experience working in multiple fields 

You will build up tech experience as well as soft skills. This is a good place to start if you do not have better offers, right off the college (especially if you are local or you don't have much experience in IT and you want to have a recognizable name on your resume 

Opportunities for training like Udemy business accounts as well as certifications. IBM proper also have a load of training. 

Decent work-life balance if you have a project. 

Hybrid model is good at CIC. Three days are required at office as long as you have a project.","Very hard to get promoted 

The consulting sector is very chaotic at IBM. 

Expectations are not always clear. 

Project Leadership is lacking too often on multiple projects. 

Pays lower than most other IT companies.

Whatever you do, if you work at a CIC at IBM, you have to get off the bench as fast as possible, however you will have to fight for work compared to another company where they will give you work."
Data scientist,5.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","Plenty to learn, plenty of support, plenty of resources. If you want to improve, the team is very supportive and wants you to succeed.","You need to have initiative to advance, and want to excel. It is difficult, and you need to want to be a lifelong learner. Otherwise, you will fall behind. There are always new skills to develop, especially with different clients and the evolving AI landscape."
Consultant,2.0,"Aug 7, 2025","Former employee, more than 1 year","Decent work life balance
Remote work for consulting (at the moment)","Revenue is being driven by outsourcing labor to india so that leadership can keep their hefty paychecks while the lower class get laid off. IBM consulting consistently posts <2% rev growth per year. This is not a place you want to invest in unless it is your only option.

Early career consultants - stay away."
Software developer,5.0,"Jul 8, 2025","Current employee, more than 1 year","• Excellent team dynamics with knowledgeable colleagues who are eager to help and mentor new hires
• Strong learning opportunities through programs like Developer Jumpstart and hands-on complex projects
• Autonomy and trust - no micromanagement, allowing developers to work independently
• Comprehensive development process from research to deployment with proper testing protocols
• Opportunity to work on challenging, mission-critical systems that build strong technical foundations
• Recognition for good work through equity awards and peer appreciation","• Steep learning curve due to heavy reliance on proprietary technologies that aren't transferable
• Poor documentation organization makes problem-solving time-consuming and frustrating
• Limited ability to use modern tools and frameworks due to legacy system constraints
• Difficult to find solutions online since most tech stack is IBM-specific rather than industry-standard
• Fast-paced environment can be overwhelming initially, especially for new developers"

Project coordinator,2.0,"Aug 11, 2025","Current employee, more than 3 years",Good benefits for early families,Getting a single thing done takes over a month and 10+ stages of approvals. I month I swear they add another step to any singular internal process.
Account manager,3.0,"Jul 29, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years",My company was acquired by IBM. The first year the commission potential was great.,"After the first year, earning potential dwindles. If you like a really big org, it's good - lots of support, prof development, etc. But coming from a small company it was culture shock - felt like I was required to have 8 other IBM people in all my client meetings - crazy."

Senior managing consultant,4.0,"Aug 6, 2025",Former employee,Lots of autonomy for people who want to be entrepreneurial and grow skills,"Too many smoke and mirrors on the consulting side, makes you wonder what you’re even doing there"
Recruiting specialist,3.0,"Jul 28, 2025","Former employee, more than 3 years",Great technology; nice people; excellent benefits and good compensation,They make it really hard to hire someone because of all the steps you have to go through -- good candidates will take another offer because they're tired of waiting for IBM to go through the process.
